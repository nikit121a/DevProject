I have two questions:
 Is it possible and how use/show form (screen 1) of customization filtrs to TcxGridDBTableView to customization filtrs for TcxGridDBChartView. Summarizing I would like use form of customization filtrs for TcxGridDBTableView to customization filtr for TcxGridDBChartView. How I can do it.

I am using the aspxhtmleditor inside an aspxgridview to edit items as shown here:
Everything works fine when running the "localhost", but when I upload to the web hosting server, it shows this error when trying to upload an image.
Request for ConfigurationPermission failed while attempting to access confiiguration section 'system.web/httpRuntime'.  To allow all callers to access the data for this section, set section attribute 'requirePermission' equal 'false' in the configuration file where this section is declared.
I checked the directory permissions, and modify permission is enabled for files on the server.
I cannot seem to fine the exact attribute specified in the error.
Can you help me figure out how to fix this?

I have the following scenario:
In an order entry form, the save button cannot be pressed until the entire form is valid.
When an invalid value is entered into an editor, 
.
Most fields need to be validated by a call to our web API.
I attached a small example to show what I have set up now. 
MainWindow.xaml:
MainViewModel.cs:
This does more or less what I want to achieve, but there is a problem with this approach:
The validation for the 3 fields is already triggered when the window is loaded. In our order entry form, that would mean dozens of API calls to validate all fields in the form.
Is there any way to prevent this?
 

I  try to implement  refresh for documents of a tabbedView.
There I have 2 questions.
1. What is the best way to replace the control of a document?
2. What is the best way to show the refresh-button at the header of a floated document?
To replace the control of the document is not possible. There is no setter.
To replace usercontrol at the controls of the usercontrols parent doesn?t work, because "tabbedView.Manager.GetDocument(userControlNew)" returns null.
The only way I found, is to create a new document and remove the old.
But there are a lot of things to do for size, location, groupindex...
It seems to be a lot of overhead!?
I made a sample project of my solution.
Please tell me if there is a better way for question 1 and 2.
If it is the best way, perhaps the sample can help someone.

Hello,
We have an issue with the Grid Control FormatCondition when attempting to align the Icon at the left of the text.
I have seen in a post that you suggest to use the  HorizontalContentAlignment = "Right". This solution does not work. (Left or Right)
To set the UI, we are using resourcedictionary to add data to the grid control through a dataset.
DEFAULT GRID COLUMN
ICON SET TEMPLATE
The Window in XAML
How can we align the icon at the left. It used as a visual info  about the content of the cell?
As you can see in the image below, we are managing background and icons as planned except for the icon position.
Thank you for your help

Hi,
I need to carry out some live testing but the app is not yet ready for production, so I need to somehow disable the automatic version checking temporarily to prevent the 111 Error message telling users to update the database.
How can I temporarily disable this check so that the DATABASE is NOT updated with a new version number when the app runs?
Also, where is this version data stored in the database?
 

I have tables customers and addresses where customer has AdresCollection
in an action I connect to some web service to check customer VAT number and address data and if get any information add customer address to address table using code like below




‍new address is added but when I try to edit newly added adres I get error : newly created record cannot be edited before save ...
o‍f course I can commit changes using: 





There is the SplitContainerControl on the form and it is docked Top.
It's left panel contains SpreadsheetNameBoxControl and right panel contains SpreadsheetFormulaBarControl that's docked Fill.

Hello!
What shoud I do if I want to hide a string name of selected color in PopupColorEdit and show only a chip ?

Hello,
I'm experiencing some weird behaviour of the TreeListControl. Filters appear to only work on nodes whose parent nodes have been expanded at least once.
I've attached an example to demonstrate this.
1. Start the application.
2. (Do not touch any nodes yet) Apply a "SomeValue equals 8" filter in the filter editor.
3. => No results => Disable the filter.
4. Expand and collapse the node "Parent2".
5. Reactivate the filter.
6. => The filter works properly on "Parent2" (but not on "Parent1" or "Parent3").
I can hardly imagine that this is an intended "feature". My guess here is that there's some visibility property that needs to be set on the child nodes for the filters to work.
My current workaround is to call ExpandAllNodes() and CollapseAllNodes() on the TreeList after loading all my data. This appears to set the required property of all child nodes.
Is there some way for me to set a property or a row style or something directly in XAML that enables filters to work properly from the beginning?

Hi,
I detected a significant performance loss in page load with dx.all.js or dx.all.debug.js.
I tested it with an html file with two dxDateBoxes inside (no additional logic in document ready function)  and always get between 450ms and 600ms load time for "Evaluate Script" of dx.all.js file. See attached screenshot.
Is there anything that has to be done to increase the load time ?

I have a report created and to print it I use this code :
            XtraReportDriverRemarks report = new XtraReportDriverRemarks();
            report.PrintDialog();
The report is declared like this 
    public partial class XtraReportDriverRemarks : DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport
Now I am moving this report to another project, but there it keeps saying the PrintDialog() method does not exists.
How can I fix this ?

Hi,
I'm trying to add a total to one of the columns in my grid, but the total does not appear. What am I missing? Below is an extract of my code.
 

Hello!
I'm trying to create a handler for context menus. I have an application with various UserControls docked in main form. Each UserControl have LayoutControl (s) with editors (text, memos, datepickers, grids...).
I would like to keep standard context menus, but would like to add additional menu items, depending on editor clicked.
I have alot of layoutItems in layout so I need a way to catch menu before it pops up , check what Type layoutItem is and add additional menu items depending of the editor type.
Thank you 

Hi DX Team,
we are experiencing a serious performance issue on advanced GridControl.
The delay seems to appear while grid has a lot of controls as a templates for GridColumns and is due to drawing/loading the controls thus it is not growing that much when large amount of rows are added but it grows as more columns with controls are added.
I've read following articles:
and got surprised by your answers.
Is there really nothing we can do about the lag when switching the tabs? 
Even when I'll load all controls on start the lag in the project is still about 2-3 seconds which basically annoys the users.
I've attached a sample project with grids advanced as much as in the full blown solution to illustrate the issue.
Please give me some advice how to improve that behavior.
Best Regards,
Kamil

Hello,
Consider toolbar in attached picture. 
A toolbar contains a BarCheckItem (Enable Radio Group).
There are BarCheckItems as radio buttons grouped with BarBaseButtonItem.GroupIndex Property (func1, func2, func3).
3 questions:
1. What is the smartest way to enable radio buttons with  BarCheckItem (Enable Radio Group)?
2. Would it be possible to enable the disabled group by clicking on a disabled radio button?
3. Avoiding "Enable Radio Group" check, would it be possible to uncheck all radio buttons?
Thank you for support.
 

Dear Sirs,
I should use DXGrid for first time. To illustrate my problems I take one form in separate project and attach it to my Ticket.
My question is:
 1. I should to create DataGridControl wich:
  * Receive rows from ItemsSourse. User can not add new rows in grid. 
  * First column is read only
  * In second column user have to write positive float or double with mask "0.00"
  In may example all columns is read only, and I don know how to change this.
 2. When user use touch screen monitor I would like to write number using numeric keypad on my window. In other TextBoxes on window I write from code behind in last  focused TextBox. How I can use my numeric keypad on Window to write in DataGridControl.
 3. How I can get total value of column without calculate it again.
5. Next my step is to use TreeView. I have to search in list of Customers organized in group, subgroups and ....  Please if exist send me link to appropriate example.
 Thanks in advance,
 George
 
 
 

Hi! I found here..
So,
Today I use: .....GridView.VisibleRowCount
for  get total (all) rows count..
But, If I search something, return 1, for example..
But I need get all number (count) of rows... how I to do?
thanks! 

Hi,
As you see in the attached file the adding mechanism has a very critical issue.
I have reproduced this issue 
.
1. Group by a coulmn.
2. Scroll down and select a row.
3. "Add new row"
=> It will perform an "Edit" on another row so that this row will be overwritten! The new row will be added to the grid without values (please take a look at the last row)!
Please fix this problem asap to avoid confusion.

Hi
Thank you very much, it works like a charm! 
One last question. I cannot seem to navigate to a bookmark in the report.
I expected the Command attached to each bookmark to go to the relevant page in the report, i.e.:



But nothing happens. 
How can I activate the same command that happens when you click on a bookmark in the Document Map?

I set worksheet WrapText is true, and call AutoFitRow(),
but,
when use print or printpriew, 
SpreadsheetControl cells TextWarp not work!!
Please~

Hi,

 I'd like it to display in reportForm.
 

Hi
I need to implement the functionality as in my attached image.
1. There are two tabs. First is Search and second is Details.
2. User selects Radio Button on first tab to indicate the type of search. It can be either by ID itself or by other details like Name, DOB etc.
3. If the search is by ID, clicking on the Next Button, the corresponding record will be selected and it will be displayed on the second tab.
4. If the search is by details, there is a possibility that there might be multiple records. In that case all records will be populated in the list below. Then user will select the option button from there to select desired record. Then clicking on next will populate the record in details tab.
My question :
What is the best approach to achieve this functionality?
 

Do you have any guidance on how best I might enable filtering based on child tables?
For instance: 
CustomersTable
 - CustomerIDPK
 - Name
 - DateStarted
 - Status
Customer_Orders
 - ID
 - ProductName
 - CustomerID
Customer_Addresses
 - ID
 - Address
 - CustomerID
Customer_Contacts
 - ID
 - Name
 - CustomerID
etc - lots more tables linked to the primary CustomerTable.
The DataGrid is to display Customers (single row per customer), but I want to be able to filter by the child tables Orders, Addresses and Contacts
My initial thoughts:
- Option 1 - Display Customer and filter outside of the results?
+----+-----------+--------+
| ID | Name      | Status |
+----+-----------+--------+
| 1  | CustomerA | Active |
+----+-----------+--------+
| 2  | CustomerB | Closed |
+----+-----------+--------+
| 3  | CustomerC | Active |
+----+-----------+--------+
This is bound using MVC to a sql function that accepts filter parameters for OrderId, Address and Contact. 
But what would be the best way to have these passed to the webapi?
Can I get DevExpress to pass them to the web api as additional parameters?
Should I add them as DevExpress filters in the UI, but then extract them (see below)?
-------------
var db = new DBEntities();
[HttpGet]
public HttpResponseMessage Get(DataSourceLoadOptions loadOptions) {
string OrderIDFilter;
string AddressFilter;
string ContactFilter;
if (loadOptions.Filter != null)
{
 for (int i = 0; i < loadOptions.Filter.Count; i++)
 {
 var x = loadOptions.Filter[i];
 if (x.ToString() == "OrderId")
 {
 OrderIDFilter = loadOptions.Filter[i + 2].ToString();
 loadOptions.Filter.RemoveAt(i);
 loadOptions.Filter.RemoveAt(i);
 loadOptions.Filter.RemoveAt(i);
 break;
 }
 if (x.ToString() == "Address")
 {
 AddressFilter = loadOptions.Filter[i + 2].ToString();
 loadOptions.Filter.RemoveAt(i);
 loadOptions.Filter.RemoveAt(i);
 loadOptions.Filter.RemoveAt(i);
 break;
 }
 if (x.ToString() == "Contact")
 {
 ContactFilter = loadOptions.Filter[i + 2].ToString();
 loadOptions.Filter.RemoveAt(i);
 loadOptions.Filter.RemoveAt(i);
 loadOptions.Filter.RemoveAt(i);
 break;
 }
 }
}
return Request.CreateResponse(DataSourceLoader.Load(db.CustomSearch(OrderIDFilter, AddressFilter, ContactFilter), loadOptions)); 
}
-------------
- Option 2 - include additional columns as deliminated  values?
+----+-----------+--------+--------------------+--------------------+
| ID | Name      | Status | Orders             | Addresses          |
+----+-----------+--------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 1  | CustomerA | Active | Product1, Product2 |                    |
+----+-----------+--------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 2  | CustomerB | Closed |                    | Address1, Address2 |
+----+-----------+--------+--------------------+--------------------+
| 3  | CustomerC | Active | Product4, Product6 |                    |
+----+-----------+--------+--------------------+--------------------+
We would then need to filter when the value is contained in a column
 
Any thoughts would be welcome

good morning
in the MVC designer I can not intercept any event when I press the save button.
the Save as works correctly and triggers the whole chain of events up to my ReportStorage implementation class.
I expected the same behavior as for the Save button

Hi support team,
when setting DevExpress.ExpressApp.Web.Editors.ASPx.ASPxGridListEditor.UseASPxGridViewDataSpecificColumns = false it seems that enum localization does not work correctly. In list view it works as expected, but as soon as you group by an enum column it doesn't work.
Please let me know what is wrong here.
I have attached a sample project where you can try to group by column "Priorit?t".
Thanks and regards,
Michael 

Our inherited XRSubReport is not working since the Update 17.2.5. With Update 17.2.4 it works fine.
We set the e.Cancel property in the OnBeforePrint event to true. After MyBase.OnBeforePrint the property is  reseted to false.
It seems to appear only on PageFooterBands.
I attached the example project. 

Hi,

I've tried to do the same with DevExpress, but I can't get the exceptions in my NLog engine.
Could you help me with this?

I am using POCO MVVM pattern. The taks is: to save whole ViewModel current state as a xml file and reuse (after restart)
Here is save method inside using this.GetType --  which returns (because of POCO i think) MainWindowViewModel_4240dffc_6386_4572_bf72_2d11708b458f 
 As you see MainWindowViewModel has GUID at the end at runtime, and it is changing on each run. 
When try read back by this method it gives error because type is different even if I'm using MainWindowViewModel as type also
 
When im trying to serialize for save via  `typeof(MainWindowViewModel)` type it gives an error:
What is the solution you suggest
 

Hi,
I need a solution how to set the color for a CommonSeriesSettings in the data source and just do use it in the preview.
I have in data source newList.Add(new GridResArg { arg = nr, val1 = varX, val2 = varY, color = "red" });
and I want to use that parameter in chart settings.
Thank you in advance.

Zeljko 

Steps to reproduce
Run sample project - set cursor in the grid (edit)
1) Press ALT+2 -> focus set correctly in the textbox
2) set focus again in the grid and Press ALT+T (nothing happens) - Press ALt+ T again -> focus set correct
 

NavBarGroupControlContainer has 3 rows of controls and it shows only 2 rows and scrollbar on 144 DPI

Hi,
I am using a calculated column ("Expertise") to show a short description of the collection of names; it works, and in that column I get a semicolon-separater list of names, like "A;B;F;G;", while each single name looks like "A" or "B" or "C" and so on.
The issue I am facing is that when I try to filter items in this colum, the filter box is empty. Furthermore, if I try to sort this column, the whole table gets blank...
See the attached pics
Here is how I declared the "Expertise" column:
I used the persistenAlias since I use server mode for the listviews
What I did wrong? 
Thank you

Hello,
I'm using dxPivotGrid and i'd like to know if it's possible to add a slider to resize the columns of Pivot Grid. 
I've attached an image to show that, when the Pivot is in a small page it's almost impossible to see the columns because the rows don't resize. I'm using many rows levels in my Pivot so when i try to resize it  or i open it with a small resolution it's really to see the columns values.

Hi DevExpress team,
currently I'm converting some flash based chart controls to your webchart control and need to keep the layout as close to the original as possible. Thus how do I show a Side-by-Side Stacked Bar and a Side-By-Side Bar in one webchart (see screenshot)? 
For example, in this code:
"s/w Systeme" needs to be a side by side bar and next to it,  "Farbsysteme s/w" and "Farbsysteme Farbe" needs to be 
Side by Side 
 bar.
Thanks for your help & kind regards,

Hello,
I have two objects which I would like to view in a PropertyGridControl. The second object is a property of the first object and containing three string properties.
Additonal, I have a List of strings. These strings are the source for a combobox which should be added to any property of the second object.
To do this I have to go to the correct row of the PropertyGridControl. Then I have to assign the combobox
The ChildRows Property of a child is always empty. In this case it should contain the three rows of the second object. At the moment, I cannot add the editor to the rows I need.
I have attached an example project for verification.
Kind regards

Hi,
I am using the DevExtreme controls in a ASP MVC Core project.
I have a problem with adding/removing a required validator.
My case: I have a dxForm with some fields.  A dxTextArea is required or not depending on the valua of one of these fields. For example if the value of the field is "A" then the dxTextArea is required. Is the value of the field "B" the dxTextArea is not required.
I created a test case where I use a dxCheckBox to set the validation. When the dxCheckBox is checked the dxTextArea is required, if not the dxTextArea is not required. the Here I tried to use customValidation. This works only the first time when it validate. Every time the dxCheckBox changed the customValidation must check if the dxTextArea is required or not.
How do I achieve this? I've attached the test case.
Thanks in advance

Dear Support Team,
I know you will say, this is not an XAF specific theme, but I think it is! 
In our scenario we want to prompt the DashboardParameter Dialog before the Dashboard is loaded. So the user can set the parameters and we do not have to use default values.
I know the ticket 
! But this is not what I am looking for! It does not work for use.
We have the following ViewController for some DashboardViewer customizations:
Win:
and Web:
Please can you give me an advice how to call the DashboardViewer.ShowDashboardParametersForm method and the ASPxClientDashboardViewer.ShowParametersDialog method?
Thanks!

Dear Support,
i have a question regarding XRPictureBox.
Currently I am having a list of List<Bitmap> objects which I would like to Show, and everything works fine if I Show only Images...but i am having the following Scenario...
1 . I am creating one XRTable and filling out the Content from my objects, (the rows in XRTable can be different)
2. under this table i Need to Show the list of Images, but, if there is some space below the table i should Show two images  (one next to eachother), on the new page i have to Show  Images ( as a Matrix 2x2) and if the Image is bigger of 1000px i should Show only this Image on the page....
is there any possibility to set up the XRPictureBox holder to be more flexible ?
Thank you in advance for your time and effort.

hello, i want to create a game tool by devexpress, so i need draw some special graphics by direct2d or Gdi+.
i have creat a simple demo for this,
first, i create a Form, and drag a xtrascrollablecontrol on this form, set Dock = Fill. then add a panelcontrol to this xtrascrollablecontrol, set panelcontrol's minsize = (1920,1080).
then add a  picturebox on the panelcontrol, set Dock = Fill.
i have create a Bitmap, and set PictureBox.Image with this Bitmap .
on panel Paint event, i draw on this bitmap. 
This is a lite version of my tool , my tool is more complex.
i can get the mouse down and mouse up event, by register the events of panelcontrol with PictureBox.enable = false. but i can't find any method to get the key down/key up event. i wan't to make my tool support Ctrl+C/Ctrl +v, so i think i must get these events.
is there any method to get the events ? Or if there are other alternatives here?
attachment is a simple demo. 
 
thank you.

We've been using DevExpress/MVC successfully now or several years now using jQuery v1.6.2 and jQuery-UI v1.8.11 and are looking to update jQuery to a later version.
1/ What's the latest version that DevExpress supports? I believe I saw a reference in another ticket (T595081) to v3.0, but the latest jQuery release is v3.3.1.
2/ Any estimates on how long we can continue to use v1.6.2? That is, at some point will you officially no longer support older versions of jQuery ?

Hello there,
I?ve got the following problem.
I have a database with an hierarchical table: TableH (ID, ParentID, Name).
I have a second Table, where Items from TableH are preselected: TableP (ID)
I want to display the Treelist from root to leaf, but only if any key in this path is present in TableP.
The problem is that the Items in TableP can be from anywhere from root to 3rd Level but i want to display the tree from the beginning, even if the Item in TableP is in 2nd or 3rd Level.
I have created a Storedprocedure for a non-virtual Treelist and this is working fine but the loading times are relatively long and im curious if it is possible to do this in virtual mode.
Kind Regards

I change Module Project AssemblyInfo Version, however the Database Version is 0.0.0.0.
I need the version number to get the updates to work.
I attached a screenshot showing the Database Version 0.0.0.0 in the DatabaseVersionMismatch Event, while the AssemblyInfo Version is set to 1.0.0.1.
Your feedback would be appreciated.
Thanks,

Hello DevExpress support, 
I have issues with tree list performance, it's too slow when loading huge hierarchical data (like directories structure) and slow nodes expanding performance. 
The case as follows: I have quite big hierarchic structure in the WinForms app. Users could expand nodes and this state will be saved. Next time user opens the app I need to restore previous expanded state. In my app, it takes up to 10 seconds to expand ~250 nodes (calculated without the parent node) out of ~40000 nodes in total. 
In my test project loading of 100k nodes takes 200+ sec and expanding of 250 nodes takes 2+ second, which is much less than in real app, but anyway,
Is there any way to improve the speed of loading and expanding?
Test project attached. 
Thanks.    

Hi,
I have a calendar in timeline view with a resource tree. I want to limit the  drag and drop to the same day. 
The only movement I want to allow in vertical.
Is there a way to accomplish this? 
Thanks 

Hi
I am using the scheduler component, and somtimes it seems that the horisontal scrollbar in the viewTimeGrid View does not show up. It is most likely to happen when only one or two ressource is shown. Is there any way to 'force' it to be allways shown, or is there any other way to solve the problem?
unfortunately it is not possible to show a screenshot as the scrolbar is 'smart' and autohides itself.

Hello!
I would like to specify my custom colors in my theme as resources in one place so a change of colors is easy and use them whereever i want in the rest of my custom theme . Can i get some advice on which resourcedictionary i should put these and how i can access them elsewhere. Do i need to create my own dictionary in my theme and put as merged dictionary where i use it or somwother solution.
Thank you 


Hi, 
In my WinForms app I want to work both with dashboards saved to file and dashboards saved to database/stream. I use DashboardSaving and DashboardOpening events, and it works fine except the Recent Dashboard section. 
I can see there dashboards, which where opened from file, but after that comes the "DashboardOpening" event, and I cannot say, if it was fired by "Open" button (and I have to show my form, where user can select dashboard both from file or from database), or it was fired by selecting dashboard from Recent Dashboards list (and there is no need for additional form). What am I missing here?

Hi,
I would like to use the MonthEdit control but with just three letters for each month, such as Jan, Feb, and so on.

Hey,
So I am trying to customize the legend of a piechart. The issue is for all the chart types though. All ItemTextPositions work just fine except for Right, This is happening when using horizontal align center. The rest top bottom left itemtextposition do keep working.

Hi,
I put a cxGrid and an panel on a TFrame Object. The TFrame has an Init procedure and a Tcolor property
From the main programm I create three of this Frame-Objects next to each other and set for
each Frame a new color property.



The result is, that each Grid on the frames has the same background color. The color is the
color I set for the last grid but the panels have different colors. That is what I want also for the
grid.
What is the problem.
Thank, you

1. I have the following form (:
 
in which a data grid is used
2.  I filled the form data and added a number of rows in the data grid.
3. Next, I made the dimensions of the form (width and length) minimal and moved the data grid cursor to its last line. 
4.Next, I clicked OK, all data was saved in the database and the form was closed.
5.Next, I opened the form for the change and all the lines of the data grid are not displayed, and if I click on the scroll button, the data appears (see screenshot).
6. 
7. How do I fix this problem?
P.S.
I tried to solve this problem in the following way (the result is negative):
Added a load event for the form:

Good day.
I have an input field for integer in the range from 0 to 100 (including the ends ). I put the textedit (DevExpress.XtraEditors.TextEdit) with name "screenFrameIntervalTextEdit" on my form and set the following properties in properties window:
CausesValidation = true;
ValidateOnEnterKey = true;
Also I add the eventHandler in my source code:
screenFrameIntervalTextEdit.Validated += ScreenFrameIntervalTextEdit_Validated;
...
        private void ScreenFrameIntervalTextEdit_Validated(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            try
            {
                var a = Convert.ToInt32((sender as DevExpress.XtraEditors.TextEdit).EditValue);
            }
            catch
            {
               //????? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
            }
        }
I need you to help how to make a validation field value with the following messages:
1. "The value entered must be a number!" - if the entered value contains letters and other symbols.
2. "The value entered must be an integer!" - if the entered value is real.
3. "The value entered must be in the range from 0 to 100!" - if the entered value is outside the specified range.
Thanks in advance.

Ok, that might work for the placeholder.  Thank you for that suggestion I will take a look.
I am still having issues with the detail grid's dropdowns - in getting them to allow type ahead.  And, I'm guessing I will still have these issues with the Count field as well.  So, I will explain the different datasources - though the code I sent you is not the actual application code.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get the real code to work outside of my application since it is actually embedded in a control in an iframe in a client server application.  (this makes everything 10 times harder I am sure)
I  build little apps or take code examples from you guys and modify them to try to get them to work somewhat like my actual app does.
The summaryLine array is actually a dataset that is built on the server and passed in a JSONstring to javascript code.  Then I parse that into a datastore of type array.  I do that for all of my datasets actually.
The main SummaryLine dataset houses the data for the Attribute detail grid (in the master detail) as well as data for a question/answer datagrid.  Both of these would be separate arrays within the main multi dimensional array that provides the summaryline data.
Those are constantly updated by me sending back what the user has selected at each step and then basically re-creating the dataset based on business logic on the server.
The Count dropdown is filled by the lines array.
The selection field's dropdown in the attribute detail grid is filled from the attributes array.
Again, both of those arrays are updated every time a value is selected by the user - back on the server and then resent along with the summaryline dataset so that things remain in sync.
This control is a configurator.  So, there are certain things that are set up in the system that when the user selects something in the base app, launches this control with certain parameters.  They then use a portion of the configurator to search for 1 item basically... that is the goal of the search piece.  To get it to where they have one item left.  So when they make Selections in the Attribute detail grid, they are narrowing down the list of items showing in the Count dropdown.
When they have it narrowed down to one item, if that item is "configurable" then the summaryline dataset comes back to the javascript control with the Questions array populated and I now have 2 detail grids.  1 for the search attributes they used and the second for a list of questions that the user needs to answer to configure the item.  As they answer these questions, the answers go back to the server and again hit the business logic and the summaryline and the responses for the questions that the user has left to answer are filtered further.  Eventually the finished item is configured and it is returned to the base app as a sales line on an order.
There are other things happening in the control as well, but everything has to be able to be navigated to using a keyboard or a mouse.  some companies will only use a keyboard for everything.  And, things have to be as automated as possible.  So, when they tab down to a detail grid, only the editable dropdowns can be tab stops and they have to open automatically and focus has to be inside the dropdown so they can just use their arrow key and go down through the lists.  But, at the same time they somehow have to have the ability to start typing the "search" fields value for that dropdown grid and have that work.
Then, they select a line and if a single selection the dropdown closes and the next dropdown is focused and opened.  If they don't select anything they use the right and left arrow keys to move to the previous or next dropdown in the detail section.  I believe I have a handle on getting the keyboard navigation and selection working.  Unfortunately though this seems to stop working when I introduce the type ahead search in those dropdowns.
I hope all that helps to make this make more sense :-)  If you think it would help get these issues wrapped up I could try to copy out all of my javascript again into a codepen and again hook up some "fake data" arrays for all of the dropdowns, but that still won't simulate the back and forth with the server and business logic side of things very well I am afraid.
Thanks again! 

Dear support,
Please can you assist.  I am trying to find a way of setting "isEditable" to false at a cellular level.  I need this because I have a column where a specific cell in a column is only editable depending on the value of another datarow field.
I have searched tickets and found that using  
info.cellElement.find('input').prop('readonly',true)
in the cellprepared event stops a user from being able to edit the value, however the cell still simulates the edit cell function, which could be confusing.  I would prefer if it could behave like the column is set to isEditable: false.
Many thanks

I have a master form with a LayoutControl on it and a WindowsUIButtonPanel docked on the latter. I have added some buttons on WindowsUIButtonPanel in which I have assigned an Image for every button state (normal, pressed, hovered) using an ImageCollection, trying to hide the default appearance with the circle and show only the image.
Furthermore, I have created a detail form with a LayoutControl and a WindowsUIButtonPanel on it, but this time I use the default appearance of the WindowsUIButtonPanel (with the circle). 
After showing the detail form as dialog, and closing it, I hover the mouse over the WindowsUIButtonPanel of the master form. The layout of the WindowsUIButtonPanel changes and shows the black circle, as you can see in the attached picture.
I have attached a sample project also, in which you can test the behavior of the WindosUIButtonPanel control for the following cases:
 when the modal form does not contain a WindosUIButtonPanel control, 
 when the modal form contains one as describe above
 when the modal form contains a WindosUIButtonPanel control with the same layout.
Thank you in advance

Hello, 
Your solution still works, but not with the new DirectX Support from 17.2.
The repository is painted as enabled but has no function, same it's disabled.

I have a bar chart where I'm using a custom ElementTemplate for the SeriesLabel so that I can display it in a particular font and text color. Part of this customisation is removing the colored background on the label.
The problem comes when the bar is too small to display the label, so the label is moved to sit just outside  the bar. In this case I need to change the text color, since a color that looks okay when displayed on the bar can't be seen clearly when just displayed on the chart background.
I've attached a solution containing an example.  If you run this you'll see the label for the fourth bar is displayed, but the text is too unclear to read easily.
 Is there a way to detect when the label is moved and change its template/style accordingly? I'm using MVVM, so I'd like to stay consistent with this if possible.

Hello,
I have been working with the drag and drop behaviors in the 17.2.4 version using the BehaviorManager,  and it works pretty good for two gridviews. When using multiple grids (four views, or two pairs in my case), I can check in the behavior's DragDrop event whether or not to accept the data based on the source and target objects, but is there a way to provide the feedback to the user when dragging over the view in the DragOver event? It would be nice if the user has feedback before trying to drop a row into a grid that is not "paired" with the source grid.

We are starting to  look at the performance of our application as we near the end of our Phase 1
What would be really useful is to have some  sort of table GridView of all classes and properties - particularly DelayedLoading
With around 100 classes and  thousands of properties - many references or association entities - it is extraordinarily painful using the  ORMDataModel Tree View

Hi Guys,

Hello
I was wondering if there is a way to globally set a preference/default for the textoptions property of an appearance object.
Typically I like to set on a grid the row and heading settings to textoptions.trimming = none because I don't like the appearance of the ellipses, i'd rather just see it chopped off.
I do this on every single grid so wondered if there was a way to change this globally. 
I'm aware I could subclass the grid to provide some of this functionality but it just feels like a sledge hammer to crack a nut.
Is there anything like:
LookAndFeel.Default.Appearance.TextOptions = None that I could set and would affect everything?
Regards
Andrew

Hi, is it possible to have the metadata used to generate the new themes in 17.2.5 made available, to assist in application of those themes to the base Compact themes for compact versions? I see you provided Carmine in response to one ticket but it would be nice to provide the others in a single accessible place (or publish the compact versions)
I also feel like the theme builder should have a native 'base sizing' capability - even if it only provides some discrete options as opposed to being completely configurable, since I'm guessing calculated values would not work reliably - for instance, large, normal, compact, super-compact - or for now, just normal and compact)
Thanks!

I've got a Dashboard where I want to provide my own data at runtime.
For the main dashboard data - I'm handling the  dashboardViewer1_DataLoading event, and that works nicely.
Now, there is a feature in Dashboard where you can add Parameters and even have those be based on a DataSource/Lookup. I want to provide data to the parameters at runtime as well.
What is the correct way to provide data to the parameter datasource?
As far as I can tell the dashboardViewer1_DataLoading isn't getting called with the name of the parameter's datasource.  Is there some other event I should handle, or any other trick to be able to set the parameter datasource's data at runtime?

Hello,

Hi,
I have a property list of dataview. While iterating through a list, I map "dataview = table.defaultView". 
I add this dataview to the list of dataViews( say the property name is ListDataView). On xaml, I bind these properties to itemsource of grid.
eg :itemsource={ binding  ListDataView}.
I want to display all the tables in dataset one below the other which are present in dataView List.
Can you please help me asap, inorder to achieve this.

Hello Team,
I am using card layout in flow mode to display information and I am trying to set the ItemsPerPage property dynamically based on GetDocumentClientWidth(), so that the view is in accordance with the page width.

Hello!
I have a Dashboard-View in an TabbedMDI XAF application that shows three list views. On of them is the main list view that covers most of the space (the other two are on the right side for the user to mainly to do some drag & drop to the main list view). What I would like to accomplish is to move the actions of the main list view to the main ribbon and then remove the toolbar of the main listview.
Do you see a way to do something like this? If yes, could you give me a hint on how/where to start (using the new templates) please? If no,  maybe I go without a dashboard and use a ordinary listview and somehow "inject" the other two listviews right beside it?

we use the Xpf Grid with a custom Theme in our product. We only use a TableView.
Is it possible to strip down the components in the Theme Editor? The current theme  contains all kinds of components which we do not use and whose themes are thus never accessed.
The theme sources are > 100MB currently and the theme assembly is > 7 MB. Is there a safe way to remove the unused components from the Theme project to reduce the sizes?

Obviously it's not remotely important but I appreciate it when people point this sort of thing out to me in programs I create. :-)
This is the right-click menu in the vertical grid. 

I need to be able to not only disable but hide right click popup menus as the items don't match custom ribbon or I don't want those features used.
        Private Sub scheduler_PopupMenuShowing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As DevExpress.Xpf.Scheduling.PopupMenuShowingEventArgs)

                e.Menu.IsEnabled = False
                e.Handled = True
            End If
        End Sub
This is what I have which disables the menu, but it still shows up.  Need e.Menu.IsVisible = False but it will not let me.  It's Read only. 
Thank you. 

Steps to reproduce,
1. Click the "..." button on Property1 without clicking the text box.
2. The dialog window should have no scrollbar for the GridControl.
3. Close the dialog window.
4. Click the text box on Property1.
5. Click the "..." button on Property1.
6. The GridControl will now have a scrollbar.

enclose a screencast plus call stack. For one group it just works, for this one the dropping always results in this error.

Hi,
I am working with the PictureEdit control in a WinForms application.  A couple of specific issues that I am having is:
1) Using the mousewheel for zooming is very slow.  Occasionally, it will zoom in pretty quickly but then zooming back out is VERY slow.  I have found several other tickets regarding this same issue with sample projects showing how to make this work attached but none of them will compile with build 17.1.   Can you provide some sample code or project to show how to get this to work?
2) I need to be able to allow the user to draw a lasso on the pictureedit and get the actual coordinates from the image regardless of the zoom level.  Can you explain how to accomplish this or maybe provide a sample project?
3) Should I be using a different image control all together?
Thanks

Hi Andrey and DX guys,
I have tried the hotfix a couple of times and can't get it to 'stick' on my Windows 10 x64 development PC (the one I always use.
I have attached an image to show you the items which failed to update.
This may then explain why the supposed changes did not work when I tried an 'Enum' as a parameter in place of the gender string of 'M' and 'F'.
So at this end we still have the original issue, and maybe more after the failed update.
HELP - please !  ;-0))

I have a XAF winforms application and the following scenario:
- there is a DetailView with several fields date, duration, description ...
- on this DetailView some action can be triggered automatically (after certain time - this is related to the application logic)
- triggered action access the DetailView.CurrentObject and updates the duration field
Now consider the following scenario:
- user is typing text into description field
- automatic action is triggered and updates DetailView.CurrentObject
- text typed by user into the description field disappears
I know why this happens - because the datasource (in this case DetailView.CurrentObject) is updated after the editor lost its focus. So while running the automatic triggered action it can see the previous value of description.
Is it somehow possible to "end edit" before the automatically triggered action is executed?
 

Hello,
I have a PivotGrid with a column that has a LookUpEdit.
The ValueMember is a integer and the DisplayMember is a string.
When I print the PivotGrid (ShowRibbonPrintPreview()), the column shows the DisplayMember, but when I use the control in the RibbonPrintPreview to export to Excel ( .xls  OR .xlsx ), the colum shows the ValueMember.
I want the Excel to show the DisplayMember. How can I achieve this?
The project sample is attached in this ticket.
I also created a video to reproduce the error.

Hi,
I have a TabbedForm which works really well and allows me to have multiple records open at any one time, however i would like to use a navbar in order to open up new tabs. I understand that this inherits from XtraForm and therefore can't be used on a user control which I could embed on a regular form.
I can get the nav bar on there, but the tabbed form just goes behind it. Even clicking send to back on the nav bar still causes this issue.
Is there any solution to allow me to use a TabbedForm with a NavBar or is there a better control to use? 

Hi, I just have a quick question about the alert control vs. the toast notification control.
I liked the concept of not showing a dialog with an OK button letting the user know "widget saved".  seems really old-school.   I tried the toastnofification control, but it only works on windows 8 and above , and didn't seem to work on my office dev machine (Win10), and it did work at home on Win10.
so I am going down to the lower common denominator, and using the alertcontrol.   
Question: is if there is a way to do a sound with the pop up and trick it to look like a modern toast notification?
thanks,

How do I make the sort indicator ALWAYS appear to the left of the header caption? I'm already assigning captions to align left, so it would go in the space per my comment:
$(function(){
    $("#gridContainer").dxDataGrid({
        dataSource: customers,
        customizeColumns: function(columns) {
                  $.each(columns, function (_, element) {
                      element.headerCellTemplate = function (header, info) {
                          $('<div>').html(info.column.caption).appendTo(header);
                          header.parent().css('text-align', 'left');
                          /*  CHANGE SORT INDICATOR TO ALIGN LEFT OF CAPTION */ 
                      }
                  })
               },
        columns: [
          {
            dataField: "CompanyName",
            sortOrder: "desc"
          }, 
          "City", 
          "State", 
          "Zipcode",
          "Phone",
          "Fax"]
      });
});

Windows has a feature if you drag an application window quickly to the right it will automatically resize the application window to half of the monitor.
This works fine with my application that uses your Ribbon control. However, when I then minimize the application and immediately restore it, it does NOT return to the previous position of half the monitor. It goes back to its size and position before I did the automatic resize to half the monitor.
I've tried this on other Delphi Applications that do not use your ribbon control and they work just fine. As such, I'm inclined to think it has something to do with your Ribbon control.
Any ideas on what's going on or a solution?
Thanks.

We are having users complain about unintentionally affecting rows that they did not explicitly select in a grid with multiselect and grouping. When a collapsed group row is within a range that the user selects using shift-click to do a multi-select range, it selects the first row in the collapsed group. Usually the intent is selecting visible rows in expanded groups above and below it. But then the action affects one row within the collapsed, virtually never what was intended. One user would say "the group row is highlighted so why aren't all the rows in the group selected?" The other user says, "I didn't specifically select any row in the group, so why are any selected? And I certainly didn't mean just the first row in the group." This is very confusing to the users, and I agree that this is not intuitive behavior. 
When multiselect is enabled is there any way to disable selection of the group summary rows or otherwise deal with this issue?

On the 
 page, under the 'Toast Notification Manager' section, it states:
Toast notifications introduce Windows Modern appearance and behavior, seen in 
.
I believe this should instead read as:

Hi
I would like to request that a new method be added to the ExportLink namely ExportGridToStream.
Having successfully used the ExportGridToHTML/XLS etc to a file is unfortunately not as flexible as using streams.
The benefits of streams would allow simple saving to blobs, clipboard, files etc.
 My proposal is adding a method like the following
as
I recently had to copy the grid to clipboard in HTML format. I did accomplish this by first saving to temporary HTML file, then loading into a string to place on the clipboard. I feel that the intermediate file handling is unnecessary.
Your consideration will be appreciated.

Hi Guys, First i wanna congratulate for this great tool!
Im having some issues trying to accomplish a smooth ajax refresh to the Grid, what should be simple task, but maybe im going on the wrong way.
Im developing a website where  i have 2 grids, that are updated every 5 seconds, and the first grid row selection is what filter the second one.
The first one is done using StaticJson and its working fine.
The problem is with the second...  That i need to update my SourceUrl, with row selecion parameters and ask for a grid refresh....
Im able to do that using CustomDataSource, like this:
and them setting option:dataSource to force the grid refresh...
It seems to work, but the grid refresh is not an Ajax refresh.... It blinks the hole grid during the update...
Maybe the grid does not kown the key, and is not doing an ajax refresh ?
Ou maybe there is another way to do that ?
Thanks in advance.

I have a non persistent action parameter that works with a popup action.
The action parameter contains both a bool and a double value.
There is an appearance rule on the double value to set it to enabled = false when the bool is set to false.
However when the popup action is initialised the appearance rule does not seem to take affect.
It requires the user to toggle the bool on and off again before the appearance rule runs as expected.
Any feedback would be appreciated. 

please provide a simple example (in a visual studio project) which export a gridview to various format like excel, pdf.
The gridview is in MVC extension. 

I'm able to find the XlCellType.xlCellTypeConstants using Excel interop as follows:
How can I find the same cell types in the DevExpress Worksheet?
 

Hi,
I ran the sample project below but didn't understand why the changes were not stored upon leaving the cell. Is it something wrong with the code, or am I missing something?
Thanks and regards,
JC 

please provide a simple example (in a visual studio project) which the gridview is part of a form and user can choose one or more  entries in the grid.
Let say the gridview contains a list of persons with fields such as lastname, firstname, phone, fax (just a very simple list)  Let say each person has a column of checkbox and the user would check the checkbox to indicate the person is selected.  one or more persons can be selected.
when user submit the form in MVC, how to retriever the pe rsons along with other fields in the form in the controller.
Assuming the form is submit via a post. with html.antiforge token.
just to clarified each person is identified by a uniqueid field (hidden in the grid).   When the form posted, as long as the userid is retrieved as a list<int>
will be sufficient. 

Should this work with WPF?
I have attached the event handler as shown above but it never fires.
If this is WinForms only, how do I implement the same behaviour with WPF?

Sorry for simple questions..  no easy way to find answers.

Need to turn scrollbars to show automatically for VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL on the scheduler control.
Appts are fixed width.  So after about 15 appts, they go off the right side of the schedule.  I need the horizontal scroll bar to appear at that time so I can see all appointments.
The same thing happens when a resource is added to view.  Need to be able to scroll.
Please show me where and how to add these bars..
Thank you.

I'm trying to show three titles on the accordion component but only the first item title is visible until that item is clicked, then the other items become visible. How do I make all item titles visible?
For example, these three titles:
    Item1
    Item2
    Item3
We should be able to see all three titles after the page loads. But currently this is all I see after the page loads:
    Item1
I can't see the titles 'Item2' and 'Item3'. Then, when I click on Item1, Item1 expands to show its content, and Item2 and Item3 finally become visible:
    Item1
        item of content 1
    Item2
    Item3
This is the HTML I have:
        <dx-accordion
                      [dataSource]="accordionItems"
                      [collapsible]="true"
                      [multiple]="true"
                      [animationDuration]="300">
         </dx-accordion>
            <div *dxTemplate="let accordionItem of 'title'">
                {{accordionItem.name}}
            </div>
            <div *dxTemplate="let accordionItem of 'item'">
            </div>
How do I make all item titles visible at all times?

Hello,
I am using dxDataGrid to display some data and running into an issue when trying to export the data into excel. Following is the scenario/requirement:
Only selected columns are displayed using dxDataGrid but when exportToExcel is clicked, application should get data for all the columns (even for the ones which are not displayed on UI) and export it to excel.
1. I have 2 dxDataGrids on the UI (dxDataGrid1, dxDataGrd2). dxDataGrid1 displays the selected column on UI. dxDataGrid2 is hidden.
2. On export to excel click, service gets all the required data, populates  dxDataGrid2 and then export to excel using dxDataGrid method 
I tried implementing as suggested above but the 
 functionality does not work from within the callback method of the service. Following is the snippet of 
:
private exportGridDataToExcel(): void {   
        //this.getExcelGridData(); <<---- this is pushed to page_load just to make sure data is there before export happens
        this.excelGridInstance.exportToExcel(false);  <<---- CALL TO EXPORT TO EXCEL IS MOVED OUTSIDE THE SERVICE CALLBACK
 }
Please advise:
1. If the suggested implementation is right approach?
2. If yes, how to make export work from within the service call.
Thanks

Is there a way for a sub form (object) to save the parent form (object) when the child from save button is pressed?
I tried overriding OnSaved on the child object to execute objectSpace.CommitChanges(), but the parent form is still in an unsaved state? 

Hi
I'm trying to catch a keypress when a grid cell is being edited so that I can do something particular if TAB is pressed (rather than end editing).  However, the KeyUp and KeyDown events don't get fired when a key is pressed .  I've tried these events both in the GridColumn and in GridColumn.EditSettings/TextEditSettings .  Whatever is handling the key presses is skipping these events.




How do I go about catching a key press (or key up/down)?
Thanks
Craig


Curiously, have there been consideration or perhaps changes to the multiple days selection in Scheduler control? Similar to 
 we require to select non-sequential dates in monthly view, for example only all weekends, then create appointments for all days selected. Shift + left click or click and drag, only selects adjacent dates, but is there a way to use Ctrl + Left click to select a few different entities?
But I cannot figure out for the life of me, how to wire your JS code (in particular highlighting) to Settings from partial view 
@Html.DevExpress().Scheduler(MyGetSchedulerSettings(Html)).Bind(Model.Appointments, Model.Resources).GetHtml()
I found there's settings.ClientSideEvents.CellClick event string, but cannot stick that function in there, just doesn't work for me. And then I was thinking to try wiring that onto partial appointment form, so that all appointments created with the same data, but on different dates. 
Thanks again for your help!

I have been following some training on your YouTube channel (
) and have run into a stumbling block. I have a project with a single form, 1 SQL Express database and I have created the EDMS files using your wizards as requested in the demo. Now when I try to add a data source as shown a 1:18 in the training I get a very different experience and only have "Database, Service, Object, and SharePoint" as options.
What am I missing? 
I have read extensively through the DE help and there are a number of references to adding a  public variable and other bits and pieces but (1) nowhere is it explained where to do this and (2) it's not part of the training so I suspect it's a red herring.

Hello,
I have two source tables looks like tables below:
Table 1                   Table 2
Name Value           Name Value
a    null                    a    1 
b    null                    b    2
c    null                    c    3
d    null                    d    4
e    null                     e    5
The gridview is set to batch edit mode. My goal is to gather values from users for table 1.  I need to to pre-populate the values in table 1 using table 2. I tried to bind the data directly to table 2. It does not work because cells under column "Value" is not treat as edited cells so the "save changes" and "Cancel changes" buttons will not work. I believe that I need to bind the data source to table 1 and somehow edit all null values to their corresponding values in table 2. How can I do that in server side page load method?
Thanks

I use Grid Control in my application. I would like to customize the Grid Control for the user. The user can choose what columns to show and what columns are in the Column Chooser. At the end, the user can save the Grid Control preference. I would like to know how to get the collection of columns that are in the column chooser as well as the collection of columns that are in the Grid from the View Model (MVVM pattern).
Thank you.  

When I am on the web, I can scroll both horizontally and vertically using only my mouse wheel.
Wheel up/down -> vertical
Wheel left/right -> horizontal
However, this does not seem to work on dxDataGrid for the horizontal scrolling.
When wheel left/right, result is vertical scroll instad of horizontal.
Is there any way to scroll horizontally using wheel left/right?  

Hello,
 we are facing a problem while exporting reports to csv.
In the result all headers and fields  should be wrapped in quotation marks.
I found some tickets regarding this topic. Most of them are for the grid control (eg 
).
In
one solution is presented.
There CsvExportOptionsEx is used with the CustomizeCell event.
But when exporting a report to csv, this event isn't called.
Why is that? Do you have an other way to add quotation marks?
Thanks

In my grid I have a checkBox column. Whenver I mark or unmark a checkBox, the cell turns green because the value is modified, which is good. However when I undo my action by clicking on the checkBox again, the cell should turn white again but it doesn't.
For any other cell, if I modify it and then change it back, the green background that denotes a modified cell reverts back to a white background. 
I've attached a picture showing what I mean, so hopefully that helps.
What are potential causes of marking a cell as modified?

I have added new column in my stored procedure , Refreshed Datasource able to see the new field till TableAdaptor but its nit reflecting in FieldList.

I am generating a report in my WPF application.  The user has the choice to print the report directly out fo the DocumentPreviewControl or export to PDF/etc and print from that.  
The report is a landscape formatted report.  In the report designer, I set the left/right margins to 0.25, and the top/bottom to 0.15 since there is a lot of data in this report. 
If the user exports to PDF and prints the report from the PDF, it prints fine.
If the user prints directly from the documentPreviewControl, the printout seems to "zoom" and the top/bottom of the report gets cut off slightly.
Why would printing from the DocumentPreviewControl do any scaling? 

Hi. 
In a TileNav, if I sent the Command like below the command never fires.  (CanExecute is called many times).   My guess is the NavPane handling the command internally. 
So how do I get this nav button to fire?    
  <dxnav:TileNavPane.NavButtons>
                <dxnav:NavButton Content="test" Command="{x:Static local:StationCommands.NavigateToPage}"/>
Thanks

Hello,
I have a requirement that the grid search panel default to "StartsWith" but allows the user to change the filter to "Contains".  I was able to set the SearchPanelFindFilter to StartsWith, but need help allowing the user to change this at run-time.
I would like the user to be able to do this in the search panel via a Radio button or some other means.  I searched your examples and tickets and haven't found a solution.
If you could please provide a detailed example as I need to implement this rather quickly, I'd greatly appreciate it.
Thanks,

Current GridView xaml:

I have a simple grid (see attachment).  The records are just loaded into a simple data grid.  I'm just thinking there is probably a better way to handle the case where one user has two roles (see Robert A Wilson).  Do you have any examples on better ways to do this? (I'm thinking grouping by name)

Afternoon,
Currently I'm testing encryption in SQL and the encryption is working as expected. I'm able to insert encrypted values into my table but I'm having difficulty selecting the decrypted values. If I use SelectCommand="SELECT [password], [username], [id] FROM [encryptionTest]" as my SelectCommand, I get the encrypted values in my table. What is the proper syntax to select the decrypted values using the SelectCommand?
As a side note, when I use Query Builder on the SelectQuery in the properties when the SelectCommand is selected, the SelectCommand below does return the correct values but when I try to load the aspx page on a browser, it receives a Runtime Error.
Thanks for any help you can provide.

Hi Team,
I want to save my collection of images to new and existing Excel sheet (both scenarios). Please find my code mentioned below:

The auto complete property is not 100% what I'm looking for.
 
As the use types, I want the list of items to automatically narrow down to only include the items that start with what the person types.
So using the examples in the above link ...
As the user types 'B' I want the list of items to shrink to only include
   Barcelona
   Berlin
with the first item (Barcelona) highlighted
Then when the user types 'e' the list should filter down to just
  Berlin 
I have accomplished something similar using the built in ComboBox property using the AutoCompleteSource property but am not finding the equivalent in your control.
Thanks
 

As I can optimize the data load in a gid view, the data load is 1000 records.
Currently it dilates 20 seconds for every 53 records,
16.7 minutes delays to load 1000 records.
Can you help me please

Hi, I have to make visible some columns of an ASPxGridView before inserting or editing a register. This works fine with this code:
    protected void RejillaPrincipal_CustomCallback(object sender, DevExpress.Web.ASPxGridView.ASPxGridViewCustomCallbackEventArgs e)
    {
        string cmbDeb = "cmbDebito", cmbCre = "cmbCredito";
        string cmbDebito = cmbDeb + OpalClass.SelectSQLObject("SELECT Debito FROM opalaspx.tipos WHERE ID = " + e.Parameters);
        string cmbCredito = cmbCre + OpalClass.SelectSQLObject("SELECT Credito FROM opalaspx.tipos WHERE ID = " + e.Parameters);
        bool ContadorAutomatico = (bool)OpalClass.SelectSQLObject("SELECT ContadorAutomatico FROM opalaspx.tipos WHERE ID = " + e.Parameters);
        for (Int32 i = 0; i < RejillaPrincipal.Columns.Count; i++)
        {
            string Name = RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Name.ToString();
            if (ContadorAutomatico && Name == "Numero")
            {
                GridViewDataTextColumn c = (GridViewDataTextColumn)RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i];
                c.ReadOnly = true;
                RejillaPrincipal.Settings.ShowStatusBar = GridViewStatusBarMode.Visible;
                msg = "Info: Este tipo de documentos tiene contador automatico, el numero lo genera el sistema y el campo esta desactivado.";
                continue;
            }
            if (Name.IndexOf(cmbDeb) < 0 && Name.IndexOf(cmbCre) < 0)
                continue;
            if (Name == cmbDebito || Name == cmbCredito)
                RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Visible = true;             // HERE I MAKE THE COLUMNS VISIBLE
            else
                RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Visible = false;
        }
    }
    protected void RejillaPrincipal_StartRowEditing(object sender, DevExpress.Web.Data.ASPxStartRowEditingEventArgs e)
    {
        string cmbDeb = "cmbDebito", cmbCre = "cmbCredito";
        string ID = RejillaPrincipal.GetRowValuesByKeyValue(e.EditingKeyValue, "TipoID").ToString();
        string cmbDebito = cmbDeb + OpalClass.SelectSQLObject("SELECT Debito FROM opalaspx.tipos WHERE ID = " + ID);
        string cmbCredito = cmbCre + OpalClass.SelectSQLObject("SELECT Credito FROM opalaspx.tipos WHERE ID = " + ID);
        bool ContadorAutomatico = (bool)OpalClass.SelectSQLObject("SELECT ContadorAutomatico FROM opalaspx.tipos WHERE ID = " + ID);
        for (Int32 i = 0; i < RejillaPrincipal.Columns.Count; i++)
        {
            string Name = RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Name.ToString();
            if (ContadorAutomatico && Name == "Numero")
            {
                GridViewDataTextColumn c = (GridViewDataTextColumn)RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i];
                c.ReadOnly = true;
                RejillaPrincipal.Settings.ShowStatusBar = GridViewStatusBarMode.Visible;
                msg = "Info: Este tipo de documentos tiene contador automatico, el numero lo genera el sistema y el campo esta desactivado.";
                continue;
            }
            if (Name.IndexOf(cmbDeb) < 0 && Name.IndexOf(cmbCre) < 0)
                continue;
            if (Name == cmbDebito || Name == cmbCredito)
                RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Visible = true;             // HERE I MAKE THE COLUMNS VISIBLE
            else
                RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Visible = false;
        }
    }
But after finishing and pressing the update button and returning  to the grid, I would like to make again invisible these columns before rendering the grid. I've tried with different events but no results. Columns remain visible. I have used this events and code:
    protected void RejillaPrincipal_HtmlRowPrepared(object sender, ASPxGridViewTableRowEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.RowType == GridViewRowType.Data)
        {
            if (e.Row.Cells[0].Controls.Count > 0 && e.Row.Cells[0].Controls[0] is DevExpress.Web.ASPxClasses.Internal.InternalImage)
            {
                DevExpress.Web.ASPxClasses.Internal.InternalImage image = e.Row.Cells[0].Controls[0] as DevExpress.Web.ASPxClasses.Internal.InternalImage;
                if (RejillaPrincipal.DetailRows.IsVisible(e.VisibleIndex))
                    image.ToolTip = "Ocultar detalles";
                else
                    image.ToolTip = "Ver detalles";
            }
            for (Int32 i = 0; i < RejillaPrincipal.Columns.Count; i++)
            {
                string Name = RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Name.ToString();
                if (Name.IndexOf("cmbDebito") >= 0 || Name.IndexOf("cmbCredito") >= 0)
                    RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Visible = false;         // HERE I TRY TO MAKE THE COLUMNS INVISIBLE AGAIN
            }
        }
    }
    protected void RejillaPrincipal_Init(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        for (Int32 i = 0; i < RejillaPrincipal.Columns.Count; i++)
        {
            string Name = RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Name.ToString();
            if (Name.IndexOf("cmbDebito") >= 0 || Name.IndexOf("cmbCredito") >= 0)
                RejillaPrincipal.Columns[i].Visible = false;         // HERE I TRY TO MAKE THE COLUMNS INVISIBLE AGAIN
        }
    }
But no sucess with none of these events. Columns remain visible in the rows of the grid.
Questions: Is it possible to make this? What event do I have to use to make columns invisible before rendering the grid?
Regards,
Leonardo Balliache
 

The new 
 and 
 and 
 dialog classes are great additions.  It would be extremely helpful if these were implemented as a class/control that could be embedded into other forms (as noted here 
).  That would allow DevExpress to replace cases where I still require using the LogicNP FileView and FolderView control.
I've attempted to write my own, using 
 as shown in the 
 help article.  It does work, though it seems slow and is not in my opinion good enough to actually deploy in our product.  It would be much better if you could provide a XtraFileFolderBrowserControl, especially since it appears you have already done nearly all the work needed.

Is there a way, easily (I've come up with a workaround), to know which radio button in a "groupname" is selected?  I know there's a way with an ASPxRadioButtonList to get the selecteditem, but I can't figure out a simple way with individual buttons with the same groupname.

After installing 17.2.4.1 last night, I ran a few tests and immediately noticed many of my grids, especially those where the form is inside a TdxDockPanel  then the grid does not align client.  I reinstalled 17.2.3, rebuilt, and they are all aligning properly.  I've attached a screen print showing the problem.  Grids 
inside a TdxDockPanel seem fine.
Also, I noticed that if I maximize the main form that contains the grids then it does align client.  I've attached a before and after resize.  It does look like the resize event is where its "fixed" as even when its starts maximized the grids are not aligned client.
I know you would like a sample, but I'm swamped with work and would have to reinstall 17.2.4 and then back to 17.2.3.

I am using WindowedDocumentUIService  in my XAML and DocumentManagerService in my viewmodel code to load a dialog with EF object. However the Close Command is not working.
What I notice was that the CreateDocument in DocumentManagerServiceExtension sets the DestroyOnClose to false, if I set that to True then the Close Command does work, however once in awhile the Dialog will close after the user has clicked on close and the dialog will reload without any controls. That only happens once in awhile and I can not pin point the steps.
What is the correct way to launch  a Windows UI Dialog with EF? and do you see any issues with my XAML and code?

Hello.  I have a Multi-Channel application deployed to an iPhone X (but this applies to other iPhone devices with iOS 11).  When I tap a dxLookup control to display the selection list, everything displays just fine.  However, when I tap on any element in the selection list, the element is highlighted for a brief time and nothing else happens.
 I have attached a basic project that displays the error.  It is a standard multi-channel application template project with a dxLookup control added to the top of the about view (starting view).
I'm looking forward to your findings.  We have a client waiting for an update once this is resolved.
Thanks!

Hi.  I am using the code below in Application_Startup to apply my preferred font to DevExpress controls program-wide.  What else am I missing?  What, if anything, can be taken out?  Thanks.  :)
 

Hi,
we use the reporting tools to deliver reports to users across two offices through our intranet. As the number of reports grows and delivery preferences vary across users we are now looking into automating report generation and delivery. 
What would be the most efficient way to utilize already existing XtraReport files and generate files by executing code? Can we create a windows application that can use the report template and generate a pdf or Excel file unattended - e.g. on a server with a scheduler so we can run automated reports before business hours and send these to email recipients or store them in the company directory?
My preferred platform is VB.
Thanks,
Kai 

Hi,
I needed to check out a couple of the Demos, but when I clicked the  'Start the Demo" button I get an error that says "your security settings do not allow this application to be installed on this computer." I've attached a screen shot for your convenience. I upgraded to 17.2.4 from 17.2.3 a couple of weeks ago and still have versions 15.1, 16.1, 16.2, 17.1 and 17.2 installed. I used to be able to run the demos, but now they don't work. I'm running as administrator and can install other programs without an issue.  Any help you can provide to resolve this issue would be appreciated.
Cheers,

How to change color of scroll bar when 
DevExpress.XtraEditors.WindowsFormsSettings.ScrollUIMode is ScrollUIMode.Touch  .

My XAF win application requires more than 4 minutes to comes up. Users are facing this issue only on Windows 10; using Windows 7, the application start up performance is better than Windows 10 (30 sec, more or less).
T?he XAF release version (15.2.7) could be the problem on Windows 10?

I have a grid with 
(datum), tk field and some other fields..
I want to group by datum (inclusive timepart !!) and tk inclusive some subtotals and grand total - see attchement)
As you can see with my code the result is not what I want  - de sequence is not correct. (I want per day the results of tk sort on time base)
 I guess the sorting is on TK (alphabetically) and that must be on datum (or id).
My code - VB.Net !!
        
So the correct display should be:
(first tk10 and then tk 1)

Hi
I wish to delete a column from a SnapList,  or even better make it invisible, by using the dataFieldName as shown in view field codes.
can you please help?
many thanks

I would like to show calculated values for columns in the PivotGrid in the same way as shown in the attached picture for a regular GridControl. I've seen the ShowRowGrandTotals property for the PivotGrid but it only shows a single value (average). I need to show: Count, Min, Max, Average and Standard Deviation, all at the bottom of each column.
How can I achieve this? Please point me to an example since I was unable to find one in the knowledge database. Thanks. 

Hi,
I want to use XAF as a new frontend for a legacy database.
I already figured out how to map an existing intermediate table for many-to-many relations by using UseAssociationNameAsIntermediateTableName-Attribute.
My existing intermediate table (MyTaskPerson) has the following structure:
Id = [PK, Autoincrement, bigint]
PersonId = FK for Person
TaskId = FK for Person
XAF tries to generate an OID PK for the intermediate table which throws an exeption because there is already an PK and we cannot declare two,
Is it necessary to use the OID instead of my already existing bigint PK?

Hello, I have a pivotgrid that shows "value+ unit" values as labels in the header but sorts by "normalized value" hidden field. It was working perfectly and after updating to 17.2.4 I see that this is no longer the case. Please see attached picture where you can see that the columns are being sorted alphabetically (column label is a string showing value + unit) instead of by normalized value (hidden field)
This is my pivotgrid configuration:
FieldName="TamanoTamiz" cotains a string such as "10 mm" or "600 microns" or "2.5 in" used for column label
campoTamanoNormalizado contains all values in milimiters, used for sorting: 10, 0.6, 63.5 (following example above) 




This was working before so I'm at a loss on what to do. Thanks

Hi Guys,

Hi Support,
I'm trying to handle the XtraTabControls CloseButtonClick Event to optionally cancel the event.  For example I have a non committed data on the tab and I want to prompt the user to Save prior to closing or to simply cancel the action.
Casting the EventArgs to ClosePageButtonEventArgs doesn't expose a cancel property.  Is there a way to do this or do I need to handle a different event.
Thanks

Hi guys,
I am wanting to filter (rows only) based on the selected cells on the pivotgrid.
I have already done something like this a while ago when the user double clicks a cell it will filter the row based the double clicked cell:
This time I am not using an event as I want it to only happen when I click a button. After looking into it more closely I believe  I have to get the cell info by using the multiselection property and getting all of the Y axis cell. Then apply filtering like the above.
Can someone help me?
Thanks,
Joe

Hello!
I have a problem with printing "Preview" row from TcxGridDBTableView. Application often (not always) remain  unstable after calling TdxGridReportLink.Preview more than once. I'm experiencing Invalid Pointer Operation during Print Preview or on closing Print Preview or on closing form with TcxGrid or on application closing.
I'm attaching sample application.  You need to click on "Print" button then "Close Print Preview". Do that several times and usually you get error on third time. Set PrinterLink1.OptionsPreview.Visible to False and problem is gone.
Thank,
Lukas. 

Hello support team,
once again I need your help, please. I am trying to create a simple WinExplorerView in ExtraLarge style from a list of objects. The object structure is as follows:
- string Name -> assigned to ColumnSet.TextColumn
- image Image -> assigned to ColumnSet.LargeImageColumn
- string ItemInfo -> assigned to ColumnSet.DescriptionColumn
- int Rating -> standard column, not visible
- ... lots of other columns, all not visible but intended to be used for grouping/sorting
Everything is well so far. Then I was trying to implement (custom) grouping and sorting for the view and after hours of trying I still didn't proceed. Perhaps you can help me on how to achieve the following programmatically:
- Group alphabetically descending by (first letter of) Name, group items sorted by Name descending
- Group descending by Rating, group items sorted by Name ascending
Or, in general, for other columns;
- Group alphabetically asc/desc by ColumnX, group item sorted by same column asc/desc
- Group asc/desc by ColumnX, group items sorted by ColumnY asc/desc
Also, is it possible to use a rating control for rating group caption instead of numbers?
I also could provide all sorting by the data source but I noticed that the view always does it's own sorting. I tried to avoid this by using the CustomColumnSort event but this also seems to influence grouping. All together this is more than confusing. I noticed that the WinExplorerView is far not as flexible as other view styles but perhaps some things can be done by code anyway. Can you give me a direction what I can do? 
Thank you!

In the reception Desk schedule demo app, I'm trying to add the following action.  
From the right side list of paitents that you can drag and drop onto the schedule, I would like to double click and open the medical appointment window to schedule the selected patient manually instead of drag and drop.  
From the Table View grid: double click on a selected row > Open a new medical appointment window and pass selected patient's parameters in from selected row  to the form.  These values should be:
a. Patient name
b. patient id
c. patient phone
d. patient birthdate
(I know some values are bound in medical appointment window. So i'm not sure which of these we are passing in to window)
also, be able to set other values not included with the selected row that exist in the medical appointment window.
a. appointment type status  = value
b. payment status =  value.
c. Doctor = value (I know some values are bound in medical appointment window. So i'm not sure which of these we are passing in to window)
d.  reminder = value
e. start time = value
f. end time = value
Thank you 

Hi,
I am using Binary image as an editor and a column editor.
Column editor works fine (upload, bind, preview).
Stand alone editor uploads fine, shows the picture and the form sends the picture to database and it is saved.
But when I open the saved record, the picture is shown only if I remove the edit capabilities of the control.
Is this by design?
This is my code:
Thank you.

We're migrating from 
 to RichEdit. Our users have a library of existing RTFs containing fields created by the old editor. When users work with RTFs in our app, we want the old merge fields to look like new merge fields created by RichEdit. This ticket is about trying to achieve that, whether it means changing existing fields to look like those in RichEdit or making RichEdit fields look like our existing fields. 
Looking at your demos, we would love to have our fields look like they do in your 
 demo, where the page field text simply shows 
 when fields are shown, because that is how they look in our existing templates. How can we achieve this with our own field names? Is there a field object with a text propery I can access? It would be great if someone could show me how to programmatically create that document.
I've attached a sample document that contains 1 field created by our old editor and two created by RichEdit. When we open it in RichEdit before executing 
, the field inserted by the old editor looks like 
 but the new field created by 
 shows no text while the field created by 
 shows 
, as shown in the "before" screenshot. After calling 
, the old merge field is similar to the new merge field (old shows 
 and new shows 
), and the field produced by 
 shows 
. See the "after" screenshot. 
We want to control the text displayed before 
 so it reads
such that new fields look like the old fields. Is this possible? 
If not, can you offer a work around so we can make our old fields look like new fields either before or after 
? Is there some kind of server-side API to extract all fields so we can replace the old fields with those that look like new fields?

Hi guys,
I am trying to add a glyph to a button programatically  but I cannot figure out how to do it.
Here is what I have however it won't work:
The only way I can think of is to stream the image, but I don't think it will work properly when it's installed onto an end user pc. Do I need to create an imagecollection? If so could you detail how to do this? 

I have been playing with a test application to get used to some of the controls.  I've been taking this information and am slowly adding to my application.  I've found I would like to add a new bar so I can have a couple of static labels to sit just below the ribbon control and above the Navbar and document manager area where the documents will show.
The attached image shows a purple area where I would like to see the bar to show up, moving the rest of the controls down.  The test application is the one Dmitry sent back to me recently in 
. 
Can you help me figure out how to add the new bar?  I've tried adding a bar manager and tried to use the current ribbon to add a new bar but nothing shows up under the ribbon, only at the top of the form or bottom.
Thank you

When default currency symbol is changed on the PC grid columns properly display new currency symbol, however, footers still show default '$' sign. Is there a fix to this other than trying to reformat summaries at run-time?

Hi,
I'm having trouble with the horizontal alignment of cells in the DataArea in my PivotGrid when I print the grid. On runtime it works fine, i.e. the result values are horizontally aligned to the center. But when I print out the grid and it is visible in the print preview window, the result values are all now horizontally aligned to the left.
I created a 
 in code-behind for the printing and I tried to change the alignment there aswell: 
But this doesn't work either. I've tried changing the CellTemplate to ValueTemplate but that doesn't make any difference. Should I be using PrintCellTemplate? If I try to use that then all the cells for the DataArea disappear in the print preview window.
I also created a custom field value template which did not work for the alignment when printing.
What am I missing? Why does work fine on runtime and not when I print?
Here's a code snippet of the beginning of my pivot grid:
Looking forward to hear from you!

Asta

This doesn't make sense to me. I've never run into it but I rarely use a master/detail setup. I have a DevExpress PopupMenu for the master grid rows and also for the Attachments detail grid view rows. I have 2 different DevExpress PopupMenu controls on the form.
I activate the popup in the MouseUp event. I've been using that strategy for a long time based on advice I got from you folks a while back.
This is the code for the master view
This is the code for the detail view
What I notice happening is when I right click on a master view row, ONLY the gridViewEmailLog_MouseUp code runs. But when I right click on the  gridViewEmailAttachments_MouseUp code, BOTH events run. Is this by design? It seems wrong. Why, if they are SEPARATE views would the master view's event run when right clicking on the detail view?

I use propertygrid to display some properties,but i found that the numeric data is not auto select on click.
in the support center, i found that i can complete this by change OptionsBehavior.ShowEditorOnMouseUp = true, it works.
but this cause another problem, other row will not change value if it not has focus, in other words, if i want to change the value which is not have focused on it, i must click twice at least.
so i want to know, how to make the row editor can auto select all text when i first click, without OptionsBehavior.ShowEditorOnMouseUp = true.
relevance ticket:

I have screen in my application wich is canvas layout and in the canvas there is a collection of wpf controls.
My requirement to give the user possible to hide elements and take them back.
I saw that you have a lot of  perfect implementations for this behavior like in the tabs or in the grid's columns that the user can hide column and take it back.
My question is if I have possible to use with one of your implementation to hide simple microsoft control.
Do you have a easy way to do that.
thank a lot of all.

Hi!
I'm using "ShowPrintDialogOnOpen" of "PdfExportOptions" in XtraPrinting - Class in an ASP.NET Webform application. This option working for most browsers but it seems there is an issue if you are using "Safari" (Version 11) browser with native pdf viewer.
You can verify this issue with one of your examples: 
Run the 
 demo (E454 using "Run Online" button) with safari v11 without using a pdf plugin (use the native safari pdf) the printing dialog will open. Now download the example and 
 and run the demo application again with safari -> no printing dialog will open.
Around two years ago you have changed the PDF-Exporting. So if you add to "report.aspx.cs" this line
and run the demo again with v17.2.3 > printing dialog will open. So there must be any error in the new pdf exporting.

Hi, sometimes i accidentaly drag butons from bar in designer. The button is still on form somwhere (i can see it in designer) but i cannot see it anyhwere on bar. 
How can i link button again to chooser toolbar  ? 

As I see from your several support items and demo's, many users are looking for the ability to change node order within a sibling collection, both by button press and by drag-drop.  My Treelist (see code below) has a DispOrder column to contain each node's position within the sibling collection.  The Treelist out of the box allows dragging and dropping nodes, but the dragged node is automatically demoted to the next level and made a child node of the drop target node. It seems very likely that I need to capture the index of the target node when the drop occurs, but the code block I found in your help does not run correctly and thereby prevents the treelist from doing anything.
Here is the code fragment I am trying to use:
 <ClientSideEvents EndDragNode="function(s, e) {
         var nodeKeys = s.GetVisibleNodeKeys();
                        For (var i = 0; i &lt; nodeKeys.length; i++) {
                            If (s.GetNodeHtmlElement(nodeKeys[i]) == e.targetElement) Then {
                                s.PerformCallback(&quot;DRAGNODE&quot; + e.nodeKey + &quot;|&quot; + nodeKeys[i]);
                                Return;
                            }
            }

Hi. How can i print pictureEdit image ?

Hello,
I have a problem with the pivot grid comtroller: as documented in the attach, I would split free space between all columns of pivot, and not only in the first one.
The width of the pivot grid is set by a javascirpt on the windows ready or resize windows.
Could you please give me any suggestion to overcome such an issue?
Thanks in advance,
Best Regards.
 

Hello.
I have a DevExpress.XtraEditors.XtraUserControl (I try to use an xtraScrollableControl, but I can not make it work), in this control I want to insert other user controls (for example, a graphic) as shown in the attached image; and having the container show a scroll bar when the number of internal controls needs more width than the container and to be able to move the container to show the controls.
Please, it is possible indications to an example of how to achieve functionality like this.
Thank you in advance for your help and support.
 

I need to show a simple timeline for a day (12:00 am to 11:59 pm) that shows occupancy of room(s) (usually one room, but some multiple rooms.  I don't need to edit it or do anything fancy with it other than a label and some tooltips showing start/end times, description.  Visually they need to see at what times during the day it is going to be occupied.
This needs to be shown in the UI (static with occasional updates) and in reports as well.
Embedding a schedule object with timeline view seems like overkill .  I've got the suite of winforms Tools, is there any guidance one the best way using your tools to show this in winforms and xtrareports?
Thanks,
Brian

My application windows xaf, stops responding when executing an OCX component in the viewcontroller action
When I run the same component call code by program or window, it works.
What could be happening?
Can you help me 

So i used this to override the click event on a list view row : 
So it triggers, but i cannot get the current object 
I tried :
e.InnerArgs.CurrentObject
e.InnerArgs.Action.SelectionContext.SelectedObjects[0]
e.InnerArgs.SelectedObjects[0]
View.CurrentObject
All of them return the first row, not the one i click. 
And there is another problem. After the event is handled all the rows in the list appear selected. Why is that ? Either way, i dont need the user to be able to select multiple rows (because i am showing a list of nonpersistent objects that are in fact report names). 

We need to show PopupContainerControl, when user is editing text in PopupContainerEdit. Focus has to be in PopupContainerEdit to don`t interrupt user input.   
After update to 17.2.5, the code we were using  before, stopped to work. The PopupContainerControl  is closing when focus moved to PopupContainerEdit. 
How to keep focus in PopupContainerEdit and have PopupContainerControl opened, while user is typing.
Please have a look at attached example.
Thank you.

In your documentation at 
the hint controls appears with black background and black callout arrow with white text. How did you accomplish this? I see nothing in the demo files that change the look. 

Our XML dashboard files are stored in a table and we have both a window and webform dashboard viewer to display the same xml... We recently made a change to a dashboard that caused the web version to render incorrectly when compared to the windows version... 
Please see attached video (Left is window (Good), Right is Web (Wrong))
Notice the TreeMap slices when used to filter, they change size on the web version, why? on window version they do not which is the correct behavior
BTW: the change we made was to disable "ignore master filter" on the combo-box, if we re-enable that, they they both behave the same ...Again this is the same XML being accessed by both viewer
size of the treemap slices should not be changing when used to filter data...
Please help

Hi, I want to use the Accordion control to make a navigation bar like the one in the attached screenshot.When it is minimized I want it to show the text below the icon and I cant seem to find a way of doing it. I want it to look like the one shown in the attached image as this is what we use on our web client and I want the Windows Application to match. I thought about using a label control as the header control and changing the image alignment when it is minimized but they dont show when minimized and you cant click on the label to open the group. Any help will be much apreciated

Hello   
I am seeing something I don't understand.   I have two forms that have a splitContainer on them - and I am seeing different property lists...  
Form 1 (created 10+ months ago)
  - Standard Xtra Form
  - Created under an older version of your controls (17.1?)
  - Older controls are un-installed
Form 2  (Created today)
  - Following your videos - this form base class is the RibbonForm
  - Created under 17.2.3 of your controls (what I currently have installed)
Note - I am in the process of redeveloping Form 1 - and will be moving everything over to Form 2 over the next few weeks.  Hence when you look at the images - the controls have the same names!! 
As you can see in the attached images in the Zip file - there are splitContainers on each form - with the same name.  However, when I select them and look at their properties - I do not see the same available properties.  Why would this be?  
Could it be that the splitContainer created in the older version of the components still has its same value?  This seems more than unlikely - and I don't think it is even possible?  Or could it be that I have some property set somewhere that is causing this?  
Do you have any thoughts as to what might be causing this?   
Bradley 
 

For years I have been struggling with the text offered under the topic "TcxDBDataController.MasterKeyFieldNames"  in the help documentation.
My head has stopped spinning now, so I thought i'd finally ask: how does the detail grid know about the master grid? I see no property that allows me to set that relationship. Or should I be doing it at the dataset level?

Hi,
We have created a custom dashboard (web) item to show Gantt Chart. It has two date field that user is able to bind. I would like the Group Interval to be set as "Date-hour-minutes-second" as default. This is the code we have written for the binding field:

Hello there,
My goal is to add a view to the document manager (generated by the scaffolding wizard) on startup. 
As far as I can tell, I need to  create a module first. THEN add it to the document viewer.  These modules are restricted to being Collection Entity Objects (as generated by the scaffolding wizard). Please correct me if I am wrong about this? The view I want to add has a viewmodel which is not a collection.
 I gather I should be using this method below, but I seem to be a bit daft in terms of figuring out how it works...
If anyone has any help on how to do that, I'd be super grateful
Thank you

I have a .net Core 2.0 project.  I have successfully added Devextreme Core to it by following all of the tutorials. Everything has been working fine and all the controls are working as expected.
When I add a .Net Core Dashboard to one of the Views, which inherit _Layout where all of my Devextreme scripts are registered the dashboard will not show when the page is loaded.  When I put the dashboard on its own page without the layout it renders and works fine.
I have narrowed it down to the fact, I believe, that  <script src="~/js/devextreme/dx.all.js"></script>  which is registered on the _Layout Page is the culprit.  When I comment it out the Dashboard now appears correctly, but of course non of my other Devextreme controls work.
What should I do and what is the work around?
Thanks so much in advance, 

Hello
We have a report with a number of charts in the Report Footer. We calculate the values 'manually'  using the BeforePrint of the field:
Every time we use the in-report sort the chart values are increased by the number of records (refer attached video and screen shots). I have tried resetting the counter values (e.g. IR1) in the report BeforePrint but the new value is ignored.
How can I ensure that the correct values are always displayed in the chart?
Thanks

Hi there,
I wish to limit end-user's interaction with the web report designer, is it possible?
For example, end-user will only be able to do sorting/filtering/grouping and save. No deleting or adding components from/to the web report.

My objective is to drag an element from the DevExpress 
 control to the 
.  It appears the Accordion 
 supports drag-and-drop for Winform, but not WPF.  Therefore can you provide an example of how I could implement this functionality manually.  Should I follow the code in this old 
, or is there a better way.  I was also concerned that 
 using drag-and-drop manager is a legacy approach.  Because I imagine a solution would involve an Accordion drag source having the legacy drag manager while the destination being a GridControl with native drag-and-drop.  On the destination TreeListControl I just need a method to be called upon drop.  The method would need to be called with the Accordion source item and the TreeListControl destination item.
Here is a partial 
, but it does not provide the details of a full implementation. 
Thanks,

Hi, 
In our application, we added a custom report, where user can create their own pivot grid, user get to select which fields to group and display in the grid and also be able to add custom field from expression field /custom formula. The issue with the custom fields is that the total(sum) result after grouping sometimes is not as expected, as explained in attached image. 
User has created a custom field [test] with a formula (estimated cost column/ network measure column). Please note that the formula is not fixed, users can come up with any formula, so we cannot incorporate the formula in the program, but their purpose is to derive value from total of field1 and total of field2 from their grouping, and then apply the formula, in this case is total cost divided by total network measure per grouping. 
The expected [test] field total sum grouped by 'Floor 1' is 7.14. However what the pivot grid has resulted is the the sum of the custom fields. 
Is there a way to fix this? Appreciate your help. Thank you

Hi:
I'm using the following xls export option to export the grid view to excel
      Dim opt As XtraPrinting.XlsExportOptionsEx = New XtraPrinting.XlsExportOptionsEx
      opt.ExportType = DevExpress.Export.ExportType.WYSIWYG
      opt.AllowHyperLinks = DefaultBoolean.False
      grdView.ExportToXls(dlgSave.FileName, opt)
one of the grid column has hyperlink, this will cause the column not able to AutoSum in the exported excel. I've set the AllowHyperLinks to False, but still the HyperLink will export.
Attached is the workbook that export from the gridivew.

Hello
I have two forms...  One is shown (SplitterOrig.png) and it has the splitters the way I am thinking of going (it is our original form - designed last year).
The second is a new form I am starting to work on.  In both forms I am using the same splitterControl - and both are using the same skin and same defaultlookandfeel control.  
I know I must have done something to get it to look the way it does - but I cannot figure it out.   I know I did not modify the skin.  
Any thoughts as to what I might be missing to change the style of the splitter bar?

Dear Whom it may concern,
 
We are currently using DevExtreme ver. 15.1
After upgrading to ver. 17, for the js/localization/dx.all.ko.js, which is seen as Korean language related files we call Globalize.addCultureInfo() Function, which does not support in ver. 17
Other language file which has been upgraded to ver. 17, the language-related files calling function has been changed. Only the ver.15 and Korean language related files can call the same functions. 
We would like to know if the language support has been discontinued or if there is an issue regarding the upgrade process. Could you inform us the solution to this problem? 
If the additional language support has been discontinued, we would like to know if there would be further supporting plan.  
 
Thank you.

Hello, Team!
 There is a problem with date occuring rules. DashboardDesigner doesn't change "DateType" parameter in a dashboard layout. If I change the parameter manually by a notepad, it works, but the component can't change it.
Example manually changed rule:
<GridItemFormatRule Name="Rule 1" DataItem="DataItem4" DataItemApplyTo="DataItem4">
          <FormatConditionDateOccuring 
>
            <AppearanceSettings AppearanceType="Purple" />
          </FormatConditionDateOccuring>
</GridItemFormatRule>
I attached the sample to show the problem, try to change the rule by the editor, it doesn't work. 
Also it is easy to reproduce in your's dashboard demos, for example here: 
1) add grid item
2) add "Date"column 
3) add some  DateOccuring rule - it doesn't work :-(

We want custom repositories on every day of the scheduler i.e. we want a calendar view in which there are tasks and sub-tasks and there should be master checkboxes to mark all tasks as 'Done' on day/week/month/year level. Checking a master checkbox would mean that a task has been marked 'Done' for the whole day/week/month. For example, there is a task named "Drink Water". This will repeat on daily basis on the scheduler for (say) a month or maybe a year. We should be able to mark it as 'Done' on day level which would mean that the task has been done for all times for that specific day and their should also be checkboxes to mark it as 'Done' on weekly/monthly/yearly level i.e. only one checkbox can mark it as 'Done for the whole Year'.
As shown in the attached screen, there were 2 tasks scheduler on Tuesday 11th. There is a checkbox at the day level, checking it would mean that all tasks for that day have been performed. If we go inside the day, there are two tasks namely "Drink Water" and "Feed The Cat" which are due twice a day. Checking each task would mean that the task has been performed for 'Morning' and 'Evening'. In the next tier, there are sub-tasks namely "Morning" and "Evening". Checking both of them would thereby mean that all the sub-tasks of the parent task has been performed. 
Kindly look into this on priority and get back to us ASAP. We are working on a very critical and urgent project.

Hi,
I have a dxDataGrid with editing mode: row
I create a dxSelectbox editor in onEditorPreparing.
The editor has a DataSource getting a list from the server.
The value is set with grid.setValue(event.value) in onValueChanged on the dxSelectBox editor.
When the user hits Enter in the grid the rows is set in editmode, thats fine.
But if the user has foucs on a column with a dxSelectBox  editor with a value the value is cleared on entering the editor with enter.
Is not always happing but when it happens the onValueChanged is triggered with value = null. 
I know i can set allowClearing = false, but thats not an option in this case because the user needs to be able to clear.
How can I stop Enter from clearing the value?

In 17.2.5, why is the new permission not available when it added by the Updater class?

Hello Devexpress Team,
we want to switch from our old Reporting Tool to XtraReports.
In both ways we create PDF's from the reports.
Everything we tried works fine so far, but we have one problem.
We have to find a way to send a report by Fax.
In our old Solution this works with a Fax-String, which is integrated in the Report.
The Fax Printer parses that String, which contains the number and does the work.
This does not work with DX Reports. The Fax String cannot be parsed out of the generated *.ps File.
Yes, I already read this ticket:
Is there any way, for example by using a certain report control, to make text readable in the postscript file?
Or do you have any other suggestions for sending XtraReports by Fax? 
Best Regards,
Philipp

Hello,
We have upgraded to new DevExpress version and new security module.
In "old version" we have created a user preferences business object where user can decide if he wants to work with MDI or SDI.
We override LoggedOn event and update ShowViewStrategy depending on user preferences.
Since with new version this code does not work anymore. You can find a simplify project in attachment to reproduce this issue. 
When we set UserPreferences.EnableMdiMode true or false, it's always the MDI mode that is enable (from model).
How we can fix this? 
Thanks,

Inside  AppoitmentViewModel I want to have properties of some class type RecurrenceInfo and Collection of ReminderInfo, which want to Bind to Scheduler.
Question: Am I right, that DXScheduler supports the case when  RecurrenceInfo and ReminderInfo are string? Is it possible to have custom classes isntead of string for this properties?

this is actually like a bug that was just appeared again in 16.2.12.
after my project conversion a dynamic grid got a timespan that was converting my xallues to a strange format
xxxxxxxxx.hhmm.ssssssssssss and i jsut wanted HH:mm.
this example helped find a work arround but i believe the team must look aout for this again.
my database type was time(0) or time (7) and it was still giving me an error when the bindingsource was doing update the Dataset.
please have a look at this again.

Hello,
I have used AspxSpreadsheet control in web application to export data from  web page to excel. Some of field entered by user from web page will replace spreadsheet cell value. In my case there are multiple rows which has Qty and Unit Price column that replace by value entered by user in web page.
If in case of user leave blank either Qty or Unit price column, Amount column is not calculated /evaluated automatically.(I have set formula on Amount column) It works fine if I entered both values (i.e. Qty, Unit Price).
Please find the attached excel file that I have created runtime from my web page. 
After replacing value I have used following method that won't work for me.
Cell.Calculate();
worksheet.Calculate();
 Workbook.Calculate();
 Workbook.CalculateFull();

But the tooltip is not working anymore when hovering over the MB cell (see picture "TooltipNotworking.png").
Can you help us to find out what the cause is?

I'd like to change the background colour of the the bar underneath the toggle switch button to a different color (green) when the switch is on and have it paint normally when the toggle switch is off. In the skin editor this corresponds to the "Solid Image Center"color of the toggle switch, is it possible to edit this programmatically?

Is it possible to filter for null values as well?
I have tried the following code but it is not working.  I loop through the columns of the grid. If the datatype is boolean, I extend the datasource of the lookup, and try to handle the undefined value
This solution works as far as filtering is concerned.  
Displaying the values, however, has changed.  I no longer see Checkboxes but the text from datasource (True,False, Emptystring for undefined).
How can I insure that a three state checkbox is displayed ?
Thank you for your help.

Hi,
if I have layout tab-control with multiple tabs, the headers (if the width is not sufficient) are displayed in multiple lines.
Is there a way to enforce a single line for those tab headers?

Hi,
when I enter the edit mode in a cell and navigate to another cell (i.e. with the right arrow key) then the grid navigates to the right cell but opens the editor directly. I want to just focus the cell while navigating. 
Is there a way to implement that behaviour?

Is it possible to auto-select/highlight the focused row when the delete link is clicked?    As you can see from the attached image it's not obvious to the user as to what row was originally selected when the delete confirmation prompt is displayed.

Hello,
I'm currently having some trouble with the Filter Editor of my TreeListControl.
- If I go into the Filter Editor, choose "SomeBoolean" (a bool) and click on "<enter a value>" a checkbox gets displayed.
- If I do the same thing for "ChildBoolean" then no checkbox gets displayed and I need to enter a value as a string. This is because "ChildBoolean" is a property that only exists on a derived type and therefore it seems to not be able to recognize that this is a Boolean. Is there some way for me to manually set the type of the column?
- If I go into the Filter Editor, choose "EnumProperty" (a property of the base type) and click on "<enter a value>" I need to enter a string. I'd like to be able to choose an enum value from a combo box. I already had this working but it somehow stopped working and I honestly have no idea why.

Hello!
cxGrid displays a table of 59 fields and 1000 rows. 
GridMode = True; 
DataSet is TClientDataSet;
The program uses the code of the following construction:
I go through all the records in the table to get the value of one of the fields.
If I highlight several entries, then there is no problem. But if you select several dozen records, then "
" returns nil.
After analyzing the sources, the problem in the file "cxGridCustomTableView" in the code:
All due to the fact that 
returned -1.
After analyzing the function GetSelectedRowIndex found out that this is due to "CompareBookmarks" (see the attached file). 
 

Hi
I am trying to use the code sample 
everything works ok until I get to use the data on a pivot grid, when I find I cannot filter out an individual code, regardless of whether it includes another code as well
so the data will display and group by 
Fruit  
Fruit,Vegetables
GrainsCereals,DairyProducts etc
individually as separate entities which is ok its what you would expect , I want to be able to filter by values which contain  fruit, but if I do it doesn't include Fruit,Vegetables for example as this is a different value, the list gets rather long its a bit tedious to find all the occurrence's with word Fruit in which is what the user want to find.
not sure if the same will happen on a standard grid but I would be looking for the same behavouir
the pivot grid is populated via an XPView if that helps
 

Hello, I have a low priority issue that I thought I'd ask.
When i load a grid, the first row should be yellow.  The first row has the focus.
When you leave the row, the row is not yellow.  The other rows which should be yellow are colored just fine.  Something about the first row or the fact that it's selected???
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!  
Here is the code:
 Private Sub GridView1_RowStyle(sender As Object, e As DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.RowStyleEventArgs) Handles GridView1.RowStyle
        Dim myView As DataGridView = TryCast(sender, DataGridView)
        If e.RowHandle > 0 Then
            Dim myrow As DataRow = GridView1.GetDataRow(e.RowHandle)
            If IsNothing(myrow) Then Exit Sub
            If NullBoolCheck(myrow("IsDir")) = True Then
                e.Appearance.BackColor = Color.Yellow
            End If
        End If
    End Sub

Hi!
Recurrence is not working with ASPxScheduler by using other trust levels then "Full".
If you create an appointment with a recurrence and then delete / change one appointment of this recurrence "row" you get a "NULL" error.
It is not easy to describe so i have attached a sample project and a screencast.
1. To get this working, you have to add "OleDbPermission" to the trust level. I have also attached the "high" trust level, where the "OleDbPermission" ist configured as needed.
2. In my attached projekt the trust level of "web.config" (also attached) is set to "Full". Now you can open "kalender.aspx" and view the recurrence appointments on 30. Januar 2018 (tuesday). Everything is working.
3. Now change trust level to "high" (with modified OleDbPermission). Open "kalender.aspx" again. Now you will get a "NULL" Exception.
4. Now you have to change in the database at table "Termine" the "Eventtype" of the second row from "4" to "0". Now you will not get the "NULL" Exception, but the appointment is shown on every day and not only on tuesday AND in both resources. You also can not create an new appointment.
I haven't found any documentation that only "full" trust is supported. this was working with v17.1.

Hi,
I need to implement a 2 dimensional way to colect data from gridview
The scenario is: 
Article A with two sizes M and L and two colors white and black
Article B with two sizes  S and M and two colors red and blue
The grid would be like this:
Article A (master)
                  White        Black
     M             2                1
     L              3                0
Article B (master)
                  Red           Blue
     S             2                1
     M             3                0
What's the best aproach to achieve this knowing the detail (sizes and colors)  may vary from article to article?

STR
1. Launch Demo Center -> WinForms -> Pivot Grid -> Excel Style Filtering
2. Show Field List
3. Click at first item
4. Click at another item
5. Click at first item

We are using a dxFileUploader in a popup. The user type a description and click "Select file" button. For iPad/iOS, the file browser/action does not show up when user click the file button (nothing happen when the button is clicked). For all the other platforms the code is working fine, the file browser/action is shown (works for desktop-browsers, Andrioid tablet, also work when tested in DevExtreme Simulator, even for iOS).
Do you have any idea why the code works "everywhere", except from iOS/iPad?
Here is the html (knockout):



  
In javascrip, bound to:



I have an ASPxGridView with 2 columns.
Column#1 is an ID:
 <dx:GridViewDataTextColumn FieldName="ID" ReadOnly="True" VisibleIndex="1" Width="50px">
                <SettingsHeaderFilter>
                    <DateRangePickerSettings EditFormatString="" />
                </SettingsHeaderFilter>
            </dx:GridViewDataTextColumn>
Column#2 is a GridViewDataHyperLinkColumn wherein the generated url link includes the ID field as a parameter, whilst displaying a different field  (CompanyName) as the text
<dx:GridViewDataHyperLinkColumn Caption="Name" FieldName="ID" VisibleIndex="2" Visible="true" Settings-FilterMode="DisplayText">
                <PropertiesHyperLinkEdit NavigateUrlFormatString="/test.aspx?ID={0}" TextField="CompanyName">
                </PropertiesHyperLinkEdit>
                <SettingsHeaderFilter>
                    <DateRangePickerSettings EditFormatString="" />
                </SettingsHeaderFilter>
                <CellStyle HorizontalAlign="Left">
                </CellStyle>
            </dx:GridViewDataHyperLinkColumn>
All good so far.
My grid has an auto filter row.
When I type a value into either the ID filter box OR the hyperlink ID filter box, the value I typed in appears in BOTH boxes.
In the attached Capture.JPG image, I have ONLY typed "b" into the "Name" filter box.
I can perhaps understand why this is happening, because both columns have "ID" as the field name , but I dont think this can be correct behaviour, especially since the hyperlink column has Settings-FilterMode="DisplayText" so "b" is a valid value for the display text, but not for the ID field values.
Your advice is appreciated.
regards
Chris 

and some other combinations but I can't get it to disable the cell when IsConnected is false.
The full column definition is:
Can you help?
Thanks.

Hi,
     I configured dxTagBox with datasource value of length 4. datasource length is not consisitent when i try to select value by selecting checkboxes and using search.
Please find the code below:
var source = [{"ID":1,"Name":"HD Video Player","Price":330,"Current_Inventory":225,"Backorder":0,"Manufacturing":10,"Category":"Video Players","ImageSrc":"images/products/1.png"},{"ID":4,"Name":"SuperLED 50","Price":1600,"Current_Inventory":77,"Backorder":0,"Manufacturing":55,"Category":"Televisions","ImageSrc":"images/products/4.png"},{"ID":8,"Name":"SuperPlasma 65","Price":3500,"Current_Inventory":0,"Backorder":0,"Manufacturing":0,"Category":"Televisions","ImageSrc":"images/products/8.png"},{"ID":9,"Name":"SuperLCD 70","Price":4000,"Current_Inventory":95,"Backorder":0,"Manufacturing":5,"Category":"Televisions","ImageSrc":"images/products/9.png"}];
 
  $("#productsSelection").dxTagBox({
        dataSource: new DevExpress.data.ArrayStore({ 
 data: source,
 key: "ID",
 paginate: true,
 pageSize: 50
 }),
 showSelectionControls: true,
 applyValueMode: "useButtons",
 multiline: false,
 showDropButton: true,
 searchEnabled: true,
 displayExpr: "Name",
 valueExpr: "ID",                                   
 deferRendering: false,
 onSelectionChanged: function (e) {
 console.log("e.component.getDataSource().items().length",e.component.getDataSource().items().length);
 }
    });
Here actual source length is 4.
scenario 1) --->  when i open tagbox and select checkbox near "HD Video Player" and click ok it showing datasource length is 4.
scenario 2) ----> deselect all and click ok, after that search for HD then click on "select all" in console it is showing datasource length is 1
How to get actual datasource length value in both scenarios, Please suggest us.

Hi, 
I have 2 questions about PdfViewerControl:
1) is it possible to overwrite the ShowSaveDocumentButton function with its own save function?
Background: I have a MemoryStream with a PDF document. The presentation in the PdfViewerControl works as far as possible. When saving the PDF document via the PdfViewerControl, the saved PDF document has a size of 849 KB. This is very much for a DIN-A4 page with little text.
I save the MemoryStream via a stream directly to a file, the PDF document has only a size of 69 KB.
2) How do I hide the Fit-page-level buttons?
Thank you,
Stephan

Of course, the first cxGrid only compiles with over 80mb.

Hello!
Can you tell  me, please, is it possible to set some property in accordionControlGroup to make last clicked group selected? Now only elements displays as pushed in my accordionControl, and I want to see last clicked item selected, no matter if that was group or simple element.
If there is no such property, tell me, please , what event I should handle to implement functionality i need.
I'd like to see  one selected item at the moment (group or simple element).

Hello,
I have Devexpress 17.1.7 installed, and I am using XAF to create a web project.
I am trying to run TestExecutor using Jenkins after the build.
When running TestExecutor from the command line it works as expected.
When running TestExecutor form Jenkins I receive the following warning in the log file:
 
Jenkins service is Logged as LocalSystem and has enabled "Allow service to interact with desktop".
I managed to simplify the scenario to the following steps:
1. Create a windows service that runs TestExecutor on start, logged as LocalSystem and with "Allow service to interact with desktop" rights.
When starting, the service runs the following code:
2. For the test location, I used XCRM_Lead_Create from XAF demo.
3. Start the service and  wait until TestsLog file is created.
I attached a project that creates a service which runs TestExecutor on start.

Hello,
please find attached a project to reproduce the issue I'm having. In some cases in my application I have to transpose the columns and rows of a worksheet in the SpreadsheetControl and other kind of actions, that involve hiding or showing worksheet columns or rows and modify the columns width or row heights.
If I have comments within the cells involved, I realize that the comments height (even width in some cases) are changed when I play with the columns width, rows height, copy range to other parts of the worksheet, etc.
In the attached example (I show the transpose action), if you click several times in the top-left button, you can see how the comment height grow, where I supose to have it static in the same size.
I need to maintain the comment size fixed, because is wrong to see this comment resized with these kind of actions.
Is there something I'm doing wrong?
Thanks in advance!

Hello,

Hi, i've found another problem related to previous: header filters on datetime fields seems to not be working well. When i pick many values from the options pivot grid shows no data. 
I attach two images to show this behaviour.
 

Hello,
At the time of export I am passing page header using "settings.SettingsExport.PageHeader.Center" . I also need to show a sub heading with smaller font below the PageHeader/Heading. 
How to achieve this? 
 

If I set the type of the dxdatebox to datetime every time I click the button to open the date selector the dialog size has increased.
I have edited the codepen sample from the documentation to show the problem.
Just open the data selector a few time to see the dialog width increase.

Hello, I've an issue with printing a report on network.
I've a report designed for pinting tickets . It has PaperKind to Custom and RollPaper to True. If I print this report on the machine that has already setup the printer, it prints perfect.
But if I try to do the same on another machine on the same network (sharing printer obviosuly) and using the same report design, it's printed "shifted"  to the right. 
In sum, if i print on the same machine that has already the printer: OK, if I print on another machine over network: NO OK.
The printer model it's EPSON TM-70II Receipt.

Hello,
since we're using a custom ORM in our business solution, entities need to be instantiated through a factory method.
When using your new scheduler control, entities are added to the bound collection using the default constructor. This leads to errors and exceptions when using our ORM.
Is there a method or an event, that allows hooking the instantiation process.
Regards
Gabriel 

SchedulerControl CommandBarStyle="Ribbon" crashes on second use if opened in it's own thread.
Please find attached an example project.  Run and press the 'Open Window' button TWICE to replicate. 
This seems to happen on all similar controls with CommandBarStyle also (Spreedsheet, Diagram etc) - may all be the same issue. 

Hello,
This question is a bit related to Q278657

I need to detect immediately when the "IsSelected" field has changed
Partial code:
It should be noted that there are more then 1 boolean fields in the datasource.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

I have an xlsx file, when the file is loaded in Microsoft Office Excel, this don't have graphics, but when the file is loaded in the tdxSpreadSheet component graphics are visible.
The graphics area visible in the A3 cell.
attachment file: Without graphics.xlsx
Thank you.

I've found a bug. When i set ExpandNodesOnFiltering to true it gives below error on filtering treelist:
The ASPxTreeList control 'ASPxTreeList1' does not have a naming container.  Ensure that the control has been added to the page before calling DataBind.
 

I have a project with the tdxSpreadSheet component. 
In the application the users can to load xls and xlsx files, edit the files using a lot of tdxSpreadSheet actions, formulas, format cell's and save the file on the same path where the file was loaded.
The users has a template book, that is copy for anothers user for work on it. In sometime, somebody of the users going to save the file on disk and the next exception is raised: 
26/01/2018 3:39:39 p. m.;PC-VIDEOS1.MBarrero|TfrmBlankBook:SaveToFile:
(2)Access violation at address 066DAFFF in module 'dxSpreadSheetRS25.bpl'. Read of address 00000020 
This error has generated that the file size is 0 bytes. When the same user try to load the xlsx file, get the next exception: 
26/01/2018 3:40:09 p. m.;PC-VIDEOS1.MBarrero|TfrmBlankBook:LoadXLSFromFile:
Formato de documento no admitido -> Unsupported document format
"Estadísticas leads MBARRERO.xlsx" is the corrupt file and this is a copy of "Estadísticas leads VMALDONADO.xlsx"
The log of the user "MBARRERO" is in the "Error MBARRERO.Log" file
The user "VMALDONADO" continue editing the "Estadísticas leads VMALDONADO.xlsx" file in the same application without raised exception. 
Important: When the "Estadísticas leads VMALDONADO.xlsx", the performance of the tdxSpreadSheet isn't very good. 
The code for save and load the xls and xlsx files, is in the attachment sample project.
Thank you.

hi,
i would liek your opinion on what kind of best practice you recomend when using your controls for a big, CRM/ERP type application winforms, that i wish to have as less as usniqe and repeated work as possible.
for example, i was imagening if i create a devexress usercontrol, and put there 1 ribbon control (blank), and one xtratabe control with 2 tabs (list) and (details), then put a blank xtraGrid in the List tab, and nothing more....
someohow i would then use that when i make new winforms, and jst drag and drop it in my form, and have the basic UI the same and ready to use.
but even thought the modifier is set to public, that usercontrol into my form is useless in the designer! i cant interact with any of the controls that are inside to add custom code and my functions. ure i could all do that from code but is a lot of work to do soemthing the visual designer can do in seconds and i can SEE what i am building without runnin it all the time!
i cant click the ribon to add new buttons, i cant switch the tab to add new controls in the details for example etc.
i know its pobably a noob question but it just never happented to need that before and i wnt to do more inherit and not copy psting the same ui again and again and have to maintane the same code in various locations.
i am now trying to use your winforms mvvm poco framework...but maybe i am just doing or thinking this all wrong, so i decided to just ask the experts.
thanks for your time i really hope for a reply.

Hi,
I get a null ref exception when running this code : 
The Exception points to the RefreshDataSource()
It seems to happen often then the computer have been left for a while.
I can?t see how gridAkut could be NULL so the null ref exception is probably thrown from a event that I have custom code in. The problem is however to see what methods that might be. I have checked your doc and can?t find any information about what "submethods" that vill be triggered.
Some of the methods Im listening on is : 
-Disposed
-Paint
-CustomColumnGroup
-CustomDrawGroupRow
-CustomDrawFooter
-CustomRowFilter
-CustomColumnSort
-GroupRowCollapsing
-EndGrouping
-DragDrop
-DragOver
-MouseDown
-MouseMove
-ShowingEditor
-ShowingEditor
 -FocusedRowChanged
- PopupClosed
-RowCellStyle
-CustomUnboundColumnData
-HiddenEditor
-GiveFeedback
The stackstrace is something like this : 
-Control.MarshaleInvoke 
-Control.Invoke
-WindowsFormSynchronizationContext.Send
-Controller.SendToUIThread
-Akutlista.UpdateGridThread()  
-ThreadHelper.ThreadStart_Context 
- ExecutionContext.RunInternal
-ExecutionContext.Run

Hi,
I have a requirement to apply Filter at a column at runtime on some conditions.
But, when I apply filter criteria using below code,

Hi,
my clients have catastrophic problem. When starting editing data in a cell, text grows each time edit is started. It only occurs when font size in system is set to Medium - 125% (or probably larger). In a 100% everything is ok.
It probably started after upgrading from 17.1.8 to 17.1.10. Please send a fix Asap.

In Turkish Locale,
if you create new tile template in TileView with Grid Designer, it creates item name with ? (Latin Small Letter Dotless I) (U+0131) instead i (Latin Small Letter I) (U+0069).

Hi,
I need to localize tool tip of Dashboard which is prepared in MVC DevExpress  ASP.NET Designer way. Tool tip is coming at stack bar out of the box from designer side. There somehow I can't localize labels and text on tool tip. I already posted similar question and got feedback. But I don't want to have Parameters way. 
Is it possible to use customizeTooltip method at javascript side while using DevExtreme. There I can't generate same legend colors on tooltip which i can see in MVC DevExpress ASP.NET Designer way.
Attach you can find chart generated in DevExpress way, Where I can also see following demo
But that one is working with image. I can't find legend image. 
Looking forward for reply
 

I have attached a samply project and movie.
You see that when the grid is hosted in a tabcontrol, the value of the editor is not pussed to the datasource.
How can this be fixed? 

Hello,
 We have a DropDown bound to an MVVM command, that loads a set of data entries (about 500 points) from a database after the user selects a value. 
The property ChartData of our view model is bound to a LineSeries2D.
The ChartDataEntry looks like this:
The Data gets loaded from the database, which takes less than a second, then it gets loaded into the chart control, which blocks the GUI for multiple seconds and then shows the data as seen in upper part of the attachment. However, it doesn't stop there, instead it keeps blocking the GUI to load for a couple of seconds and then displays the chart in the downsized way you can see in the lower part of the attachment only to load again and show the properly sized Chart. This goes back and forth blocking the UI thread endlessly.
I've thrown in some breakpoints to see whether the bound data gets modified but it doesn't, so I have no idea what might be causing this behavior.
 

Hi,
We want to integrate Dashboard into our Angular 5 HTML5 application
So far we have next questions:   
   
1) Could we integrate our API with Dashboard? 
We have an WebAPI which provides data and our application already works with this API to display charts,  
So Dashboard should read data from this remote API. 
2) Could we create dashboard in run-time without an editor? 
For instance, user select items he wants to see on dashboard (in our application this items should be displayed as charts) then we created dashboard and feed it with data from API (see Question #1) 
Thanks

Good evening, 
I am developing my application using XAF, In my web application I need to load a custom ascx where I have a tree list, next to a dashboard (in the same page). When editing the Views I noticed that I can add multiple items inside of one view so I was asking myself how I could add the dashboard viewer of the dashboard module (the DashboardData detail view) to my custom dashboard view as a separate item so that I can then edit the layout of both items (the dashboard viewer and the ascx).  Is this something possible? If so would this be the best approach? 
Thanks,
Pablo.

Hi,
I'm currently trying to implement the AdornerUI Guide Element into my application as an introduction-tutorial for new features.
A big part of my application is done with an TileNavPane and therefore I would like to explain each TileNavButton / TileNavCategory seperately.
Unfortunately I can only set the NavPane TargetElement for the Guide, not the individual TileNavButtons, so the Highlighted area contains everything in the NavPane.
Is it possible to resize the Highlighted Area (with margin, padding, offset or something) to get only single elements of the TileNavPane highlighted?
I attached a sample project to mess around with. In the example, I just want the "Category1"-Named Button highlighted.

How do I determine if the current cursor position is inside a Footer or Header? I Want show or hide RibbonTab when cusron in Header(footer) or in Document body.



Just to clarify, I've noticed that new themes have groups in 
 (backstage, button). 
Is is possible to create them manually? I am using a 2010 theme and only have "Theme specific" items
/ Best regards
Dmitri

Hi ,
I am using data-grid and in one column I just want user to input numbers. I tried using dataType ="number" but it  allows user to enter decimal point and comma as well. I want to disable user from entering comma in this number field. I tried using numeric type validation rules but it's not applying here. Using 
approach how can I achieve this?
In HTML:
<dxi-column id="gridSpotLength" width="7%"
 caption="Length of Spot (Seconds)"
 dataField="lengthOfSpot" dataType="number">
 <dxi-validation-rule type="pattern"
 [pattern]="numberPattern"
 message="Comma and Alphabets are not allowed"></dxi-validation-rule>
 In .ts (TypeScript) file: 
numberPattern: any = /^\d+([.]\d+)?$/;

Hi Experts,
I have multiple placeholders in the WebPage that is loading user controls based upon the selection.
Usercontrols contains the chart control.
Based upon the selection, we need to load the user control in the place holder, there may be a different user control in the place holder at everytime.
It creates the strange issue.
Sometime the chart loaded into one place holder, loads the design attributes of other.
I am confused, why ??
Please help.
Thanks

On another related note, 
  This is very confusing to the user (i.e., no indication at all that the grid is actually performing an action that the user should wait for) and very non-standard.  Is there someway to have the loading panel display a gray, transparent overlay on top of the grid to disallow interaction with the grid while the data source is doing its job?

You can use CTRL+F to show the find panel and then press ENTER to search for the text.
Once a text is found it is selected and shown accordingly.
However, as the find panel always slides away automatically, I have not found any quick way to search for the next occurrence of the find text.
In almost all windows applications there does a Find-Next operation exist (typically invoked via F3), this to quickly skip through all occurrences.
Is there anything similar for the PDFViewer; or can I code something dynamically myself?
I only found the pdfViewer.FindText method, but unfortunately, if the user invoked the search via the standard find panel, it seems, that there is no property or event letting me know what text the end user search for, as such, a sub-subsequent call to the pdfViewer.FindText method seems impossible for me... ?
 

Hello  Support Team . 
I am using ASP.NET  MVC Wrapper.
In my code I declared one select box
This is code of razor view,
If you do the html submit, values are not displayed normally.
     
If you see the script in debug mode in a web browser, it will look OK.
But, there was no select.
Please help me with what went wrong?
Thank you,

Hello, I've been successfully customizing my appointment form so far, using the onAppointmentFormCreated event.
I'm stuck when it comes to setting the editorOptions.contentTemplate property of a "dxDropDownBox" I added, I aim to accomplish the same as described in this 
.
No matter what I try, I always get the same error : "dxTreeView is not a function". I think there must be a more Angular way, which would allow me to define the template in html and use it in my editorOptions from the component.ts, without calling jQuery functions, but can't figure out how exactly.
Thank you for your time.

Hello,
is it possible to replace the position (per drag 'n' drop) of a tile with another tile, without reorder the other tiles? Is there a configuration to make this simplier?
For example it is not possible to replace the top left tile with the bottom right tile. After you have replace this tiles, you have to replace all other tiles too, because the arrangement is mixed up. The currently implemented mechanism especially is not usable for our customers.
Thanks.

Hi Support,
we would like to know if you have really intentions to implement at least .Net Report Server and .Net Document Server for the .Net Core or Standard >= 2.0 Plattform. In case you have some pre releases could u send us the link where to download an example?
In our case we would be very happy if at least the server side is implemented in .Net Core or Standard >= 2.0 Plattform. The Report Designer we can provide in .Net 4.7.1 to our customers.
I know you're usinf GDI+ for the document Rendering but i also saw that Microsofts implementation of GDI+ in .Net Core / Standard is in Alpha stage.
Regards Walter.

Hi Team,
I need the DetailReportBand (containing one Detail band)  to repeat in same page. However both DetailReportBands must start from a fixed position. As of now, I have added a new DetailReportBand (2nd one) and made similar to the first one. But it prints right after first DetailReportBand. Please suggest how to achieve this without using Subreports. Please see the attached screenshot for better reference. Even though first DetailReportBand contains one detail line, still the 2nd Detail Report Band must start from the displayed position.
Thanks,
Bhabani

We have a large grid that essentially provides two display sets. The left side has the ability for users to use the column chooser to add columns for detail. The right side displays the grid with the corresponding values related to each row. There is a scroll bar spanning the full-grid at the bottom, but the scroll bar only controls the values on the right. The left side with the column chooser ability is fixed. Is there a way to split these two sides to have their own individual scroll bars? A problem exists that if a user chooses too many columns, it pushes the right side to the edge of the screen and the values are no longer viewable since the left side can't be managed in the way we would like.

When you set the default selected value on prerender event, only one item is displayed on the dropdown list.
On dropdown, it should show the required paged, and load previous/next pages on callback as usually

Hello,
we are using a CustomDockPanel to hide the caption  as in this thread:
The problem, and I suspect about the Skin theme "Office 2016 Colorful" of the application, is that when we try to dock a Panel at the top of the document manager, and try to set the height, it cannot be less than 41 pixels (it seems to be the height of the header part even it is not shown when using Office 2016 colorful), and we are trying to put a fixed height of 30 pixels (less to 41) which is the actual height of the user control we want to see at the top.
I created a mockup to reproduce it isolated, and when office 2016 is not used It works as I want and the top panel has the height I want (30 pixels). When the height is not set finally to 30, currently the code shows a message to locate where the height "problem" is happening:
XtraMessageBox.Show("The Panel height could not be changed equal to the desired height");
Could you help me to put the panel to the fixed height I want when no Panel Title-Header is shown (around 30 pixels)?
Thanks!!!

Hello,
 I am using Main Demo that installs to C:\Users\Public\Documents\DevExpress Demos 17.2\Components\eXpressApp Framework\MainDemo\CS to test your scheduler. I create a recurring event for one resource then add a second resource to one occurance of this event. This event shows on the second resource schedule only if second resource is added to all recurrences of the event and does not show if added to a single occurrence. Attached is a video with steps. How I can make it to show on the second resource schedule?
Thank you. 

Short of creating an _Enter event for every textedit is there a way that I can select all the text when the control has focus?
Is there a property on the control that I might be able to utilize?  I do pre-process all my controls before showing my screen to the end user.  So if it is a property then I can make a change in 1 spot and it will take effect system-wide.
Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

I currently have the Timeline set to 5 to show today plus the next 4 days when the calendar opens.  Is there a way to have an end user specify how many days they see.  I have 1 person asking for a 12 day interval.

Hello,
we use the ThemedWindow  with RibbonControl like this:
Now we log into a RDP-session (high resolution, high DPI) and start the program. After that we switch the device (other resolution, low/normal DPI) and log into this RDP-session. Windows starts the resize process and after some time the following error occurs:
Above mentioned error occurs between one and three times before the last error is thrown (Sometimes this error only occurs if you close the window):

I am using the GridView control in a Master/Detail environment where the detail is a PageControl with 4 tabs.  Each tab has different editors in partial views rendered using Html.RenderAction (one is a CardView, another is 2 GridViews and another is a custom HTML table, the last is static HTML).  When I expand a master row's detail page row I am able to interact with all of the tabs as expected, both in cached mode and when I set it to reload on callback.  However, once I expand another detail row in the master grid, those new detail tabs do not allow any interaction.  The first set of tabs still works.  I can only reproduce this behavior in the Edge browser (Chrome and Firefox are fine). 
I was attempting to create a sample for you, but then I ran across the original example I derived my code from:
 
When I downloaded the project and converted it to DevExpress v. 17.2.4, I get a similar behavior to what I described above (again only in Edge).  However, I am able to interact some of the time with the second and third expanded detail page controls if I don not click on the text of the tab but in the margin around it.  This may be due to the different styling in use (PlasticBlue).

Hello,
What is the correct way to set bold (to the caption of the tab ) to the active tab.
Thanks!

Hello,
I'm using your RatingEdit  to define an evaluation  on an item (from 1 to 5)
By defaut, each item has its own value.
I would like to set a specific color or geometry on the RatingItem  for this value.
After looking in code-behind or in triggers, I don't find way a way to get a specific RatingItem to change that.
Dependency property 'Value' should be applied only on first RatingItem and no property on RatingEdit to get items.
Is it possible ? If yes, any suggestion ?
Thanks in advance

Hi,
We want to save reports' layout by application that uses devexpress 15.2 and open it with another application that uses devexpress 10.1.
In order to implement this we want to alllow the user the option to save the report as lower version(10.1), do you have this capability?
The reason we need this is because the users want to utilize the SUM function in the report designer (Expression Builder) which is not available in 10.1.
Alternatively,  is there another way to implement the SUM function so that it will work on 10.1 too?
Thanks,
Hadassa K.

THanks that worked. Further to babove query. can i limit the size of the panel when flys out when we just hover over the pnale name on the right?

I'm using ReportV2 and I load my report this way:
Is there a way to get the instance of the report that is going to be previewed? The reason is that my ReceptionReport has some public properties that have to be set before showing the report. 
I tried this but of course the instance is not the one created with ShowPreview
I looked at ReportDataSourceHelper.BeforeShowPreview but I'm not sure this is the right way for me because the values I need to set are known only in my controller that contains PrintReceptionAction_Execute event.
I tried to find a solution but nothing found so far. Any suggestion would be appreciated.
Thanks

Hi,
I have one of these "strange" issues and hope I don't do anything stupid :)
We have a grid with one custom column which contains an edit link. We create it as a column template and inserting  it using jQuery.
For dxclick event we want to just change a one variable in scope but it doesn't work for us. The handler is executed correctly but the change isn't visible in scope. What we found is that after click right button on the grid the change appears :O It also works perfectly when we define handler for onCellClick event - even when the handler is empty. 
Here is the example: 
Please click test button - the 'false' text should be changed to 'true' - and try do right button click :) you can also add:
 onCellClick: (e) => { },
to the grid definition and it will work correctly as well. 
Thanks for the help!
Kind regards,

We have a WebChartControl where we are using index values as arguments on the X-Axis.  Using the server-side CustomDrawAxisLabel event, we're replacing these numeric index arguments with more meaningful text strings as X Axis labels.  That all works fine.
The problem we're having is that the GroupHeader in the Crosshair displays the argument index  value rather than the text string we replaced it with in the X Axis label.  Is there a way to customize the Crosshair to use the Axis labels rather than the argument values in the GroupHeader?  I tried implementing the client-side CustomDrawCrosshair event to see if we could handle it that way, but I don't see that the custom Axis labels are available to us in that event.
BTW, we are only using index values as arguments on the X-Axis because we need to display labels for empty series.  I don't think that's possible using the Qualitative ScaleType.  If there's a way to maintain a position on the Axis for empty series using the Qualitative ScaleType, that would be the ideal solution.
Any assistance you might provide would be greatly appreciated. 
Best,

My issue is about 95% same as T588450 except my error is for the dock panels.  As stated on T588450, I'm using Server.Transfer to re-display the page after the user selects a different language.  I have downloaded 17.2.5 to determine whether it fixes my issue and it does not.
The Home page in my project is similar to the Widget Dock demo except the Master page contains the dropdown list of languages and the event OnSelectedIndexChanged is used to change culture.
The error occurs on the Server.Transfer(Request.Path) line.
 

Hi -
I'm using the ASPxDashboard control.  I've built my dashboard but I'm having trouble with formatting the "Grid" component.  I've attached a picture of what it currently looks like and what I'm trying to make it look like.  Can you tell me where the "formatting" tools are?    I'm trying to:
1. Format the numbers so 3.08K shows up as 3,805.  
2. Center the header and the details.
3. Change the font size and color.
4.  Change the header background color.

I have the following progress bar in Angular 4
 <dx-progress-bar 
            [min]="0" [max]="progress_total" [statusFormat]="overallProgressFormat" [value]="progress_counted">
 </dx-progress-bar>
It shows the 'loading' animation when the page is loading and then when the page is loaded it retains the animation but shows the bar that I expect to see directly under it (see attachment).
I can't find a way to make it behave normally. 

We have a requirement for a custom button to appear along with the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons in a MessageBox.   This button will display special text.
What I've done.
1. Created a Form
2. Added 3 Buttons (OK, Custom Button, Cancel)
3. Added a TPanel
4. Put a TLabel on the TPanel.
The problem I'm having is that the borderlines are appearing around the TLabel (or TPanel) control unlike the Standard Windows MessageBox that do not show borderlines.

I have a DateTime property in my Business object..

I've played around with the edit/display format, but always get a calender control? 
 

In my WPF application I have a TreeListControl, with hierarchical data* in it along the left column of the UI; and a DataGrid toward the middle of the UI.  The requirements are:
 1. the user can drag an item from the DataGrid to anywhere in the Tree
 2. the user can drag an item in the Tree to a new location up or down the tree,
If I do this in the XAML at <dxg:TreeListView... ,
#1 works
If I do this in the xaml, 
#2 works.
If I do this in the xaml,
only #2 works.
What do I need to do so that users can both, drag items from the grid to the tree AND drag items up or down the tree?
*The data is a different thing at each level of the tree. All the levels of the Tree are NOT Employees, like some of the demos.

Hi,
while converting my app from using PNGs and bitmap based icons to SVG, I noticed an area where we need some sort of helper class or something.
When I want to set the Icon property of a form, I need that as an Icon type. I know that there's a way to render the SVG to bitmap but an icon should have multiple bitmap sizes. Would it be possible to have a utility class where you can pass in an SvgImage and  get a Icon back where the Svg is rendered in, let's say 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 96x96, 512x512, so that we can also use those SvgImages as form icons?

I have a column which holds the color stored as integer and a repositoryItemColorEdit as the repository control, but the control does not get displayed in the autofilter row as it did with previous versions pre 17.1. And my users will not know the numeric value for the associated colors.
Is there a way to assign the repository control to the autofilter row?

I 've created sample DevExtrme MVC Project.
I would like to translate GridView widget.
I've changed translation in dx.messages.pl.js
  "dxDataGrid-groupPanelEmptyText": "aaaaa",
I've added:
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/dx.web.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/localization/dx.messages.pl.js"></script>
    <script>
    DevExpress.localization.locale(navigator.language || navigator.browserLanguage);
    </script>
both to my Layout.cshtml and Index.cshtml
but it doesn't work. I expect the grid to display translated text instead of "Drag a column header here to group by that column"

Hi,
When the flyout is being displayed, and de property CloseOnOuterClick = true, the next click on form is ignored. 
For example, if I click in close button when the flyout is displayed, then the flyout hides, but the form doesn't close.
This don't happen in version 17.1

Hi.
I've got a DataGrid witch one column has the iditor defined to dxTagBox:
...
What I desire is When all items are selected, show just one item with "all" text, not show every select item, like in the image.
I really wouldn't like to update the devExtreme version in this case.
Thank you very much.

Hi
I have a lookupedit that is loaded from the database with for example VALUE1
Then I change the dropdown list and remove VALUE1 from available values
When the user loads the grid, the column using a RepositoryItemLookUpEdit   will show an empty cell since the value is VALUE1 but the dropdown does not have VALUE1 anymore
I dont necessarealy want users to be able to add new items but since it is already inputted, I would like to show them the current "wrong" value and not an empty value.
I tried with repo.AcceptEditorTextAsNewValue  but this is only for newly typed values.
In my case the column comes from a table and ALREADY have the invalid value.
What would be the best approach to let the user see the current value ?
 

I had a project which is implemented multi-purpose MVC extensions in Dev Express. I decided to add Dev Extreme on the project and I fixed some issues already, However, I don't know why this issues keep follow on all the pages of my project. 
 Uncaught ReferenceError: DevExpress is not defined

this won't effect much to the project, but feels uncomfortable. I'd inserted code like this on Layout.

Hi
I have a border colour template that I need to use on two columns in a grid.  Is there a way to create a single template that the columns can share or do I have to define the same template for each column?
Thanks
Craig 

I have a dxDataGrid that is loaded via a collection in the Model. Can I also set an MVC Insert Action?
Basically I want to config the DataSource 2 ways, one for load and the other for Insertion...
 

So i have to xpo's. Lets say its MasterTable and DetailTable .
MasterTable has a xpcollection of DetailTable.
I would like to be able to add data for both tables at the same time, in the same view. So what i came up with is this :
 - add the fields of the MasterTable in the detail view of DetailTable
 - in the "AfterConstruction" method of DetailTable i check if this.MasterTable == null and if so i create a new instance this.MasterTable=new DetailTable(this.Session).
Everything works if i try to create a new entity from the DetailTable list view. The problem is that if i go to a existing MasterTable row, and try to add a new row in the DetailTable collection, when i get to the "AfterConstruction" method of the DetailTable class the line where i check if MasterTable  is null, i see it is still null. Thats because the MasterTable object of the DetailTable new instance is set after the AfterConstruction.
So my question is this: what would be the recommended way  to go about adding in the same view values for both MasterTable and DetailTable, but still be able to add separately new rows in the DetailTable collection of a MasterTable row (the normal behavior when having master-detail tables)

I have two primary keys for the table, Id and Category .
For the web form, the semi column is used. But  I couldn't find how to assign the multiple key values for BootstrapGridview in the lamda expression.
Please advised me. Thanks

Hi
I developed some charts for stock  trading. The trading hours cover  from 9:30 to 1:00pm. Currently if the time is 11am then the chart will start at 9:30am and autofill the chart with 11am being at end of the chart. In this situation, how can I show the hours for the chart being fixed from 9:30 to 1pm and the data only displays up to the point in time elapsed, eg 11:00? So  instead of always having a filled chart, only part of the chart would be filled until the end of the trading session.
Thanks 

What is the best way to bind a TList<T> to a TcxDBTreeList
I have a lot of experience using the TcxDBTreeList and I want to continue using the ParentID/ID paradigm.
I've looked at ProviderMode  and the CustomDatasource examples but can't grasp how that works in the above example.

Hi -
I created a dashboard using the ASPxDashboard control.  I have two grids each using their own data source.  I would like them to both use the Range Filter control on the dashboard.
I put both grids and the Range Filter in a "group".   I tried to set them up using the master control.
The range filter and one of the grids are reading from the same SQL stored procedure and works fine.  The 2nd grid is reading from another stored procedure and even through I told it to use the master filters it still does not work.
Is there a way to make both grids use the same Range Filter? 
I appreciate the help.
Thanks 

Hi,
I am rebuilding an existing website to come up with a landing page which displays all the menu options to the user . Each menu will have multiple sub menus on click of which we should be either navigated to open page in another tab or should have contents posted on the same page. 
Here, we want to show the menubar on the left side vertical oriented and would want the sub menus to appear below each of the menu. We have a long list of menus that are fetched from database, so the sub menu have to be collapsed by default and only open when we hover over or click on menu.
 And  once we click on the sub menu, it should auto hide menubar and show just the view.
I am looking at multiple widgets Menu, NavBar, Slideout.  Which one would be the best fit here and what settings can be done to achieve this behavior.
Thanks,
Silpa 

Hi,
This morning I updated to v17.2.5 and now I'm trying to insert a devexpress form, but the  "Add DevExpress Item" menu item is disabled.
Thanks in advance,
Alex 

I have the following hierarchy of controls:  XtraEditors.PanelControl > XtraEditors.LabelControl.  The LabelControl is used to display a message of Success, Warning or Error.
We displayed a success message in green, a warning in yellow and an error in red.  This worked fine until users started changing the theme of the application.  For example, a yellow warning  is fine in the "Office 2010 Black" theme but unreadable in the "Seven Classic" theme.
How can we adequately color the messages to support every theme?  Ideally this solution would also support future themes that do not currently exist.
Should we remove the ability to change themes and force every user to use the same theme?

Hi -
I built a dashboard using the ASPxDashboard control .  I'm using the Grid control.  Everything worked fine until I added a new field to the store procedure the grid was reading from.  I can see the new field and I can select the new field but then the grid data disappears and I see an error that says "An error has occurred on an attempt to load data".
Any assistance would be appreciated. 
Thanks

I want to make the ID column visible in the list but not on the edit form.
I   make it happens with setting AspxGridView-Columns-GridViewDataTextColumn-EditFormSettings-Visible but couldn't find it for BootstrapGridView.

The BingSearchDataProvider displays a list of results which you can click on to select a search result. How can I make a custom search data provider which calls my own web service and then displays the results and works in the same way as the BingSeachDataProvider? 
The examples given do not show a list of results and leave a progress wheel spinning within the search text box.

Hello,
I am trying to follow your documentations to customize Scheduler labels and have few problems:
1. See attached sample solution. I clear predefined labels and successfully create a new one.  I can assign it to an event but endent's background does not change to match label's color as it does with predefined labels. What I am missing?
2. It is unclear how label storage saves custom labels. I will allow users to create own labels and overwrote the storage using data provided by users and saved in a persistent class.  Since the storage is updated every time scheduler is loaded, how previously saved events know which label to use? It does not seem to use the custom label id but it's own which can change if order of custom labels is changed.
Thank you. 

I need to export a pie chart with a few gridview to PDF. The title lines of the chart and the grid views exported OK. But the pie chart itself does not show on the PDF.

I attached the sample program TestChart.aspx and TestChart.aspx.cs.
Please help.
 

Hello,
Currently the code cleaning utility will change the following, valid C# code:
... to this invalid code:
The parenthesis around _Numbers?.Length gets removed, causing the compiler to detect a syntax error. Truth is: parenthesis shouldn't have been removed in the first place.
Please advise. Thanks.
 :
Some additional details: this seems to occur only if the  following cleanup rule is set: "Apply 'optional parenthesis' style to explicitly declare precedence of expressions". Checking it off solves the issue.
Of course it doesn't change the fact that CodeRush should be smart enough to detect if it can safely remove parenthesis or not. :)

Hi,
How can I remove the padding between the Tab Header Item and Tab Contents as shown in attached image.
Sample Code:
 

I am using 3 TokenEditControls on a form. Call them TokenEdit1, TokenEdit2, TokenEdit3, or simply #1, #2, #3..
When I load the form, I set some properties for all three in the  Load event.
Later, I load the desired information from a database query into the 3 controls to use as lists for selection of information. I load them all identically - the same information.
I have discovered the following:
1) if I  add the token list information to #1, then perform this: 
          TokenEdit2.Properties.AddRange(TokenEdit1.Properties.Tokens)
          TokenEdit3.Properties.AddRange(TokenEdit1.Properties.Tokens)
    it basically "clones" the lists from #1 to #2 & #3.
2) Alternately, if in the Load event, I first set the desired properties for TokenEdit1 then do this: 
          Dim Obj as Object = TokenEdit1.Properties.Clone 
          TokenEdit2.Properties.Assign(obj)
          TokenEdit3.Properties.Assign(obj)
     the #2 & #3 controls are assigned the token lists without having to perform the "AddRange" operations (in method 1). I have to only add the list to #1 and the others receive the same data.
This leads me to the conclusion that 
a) my method #1 will copy the tokens from one control to the others, but not necessarily copy the other desired properties, and 
b) my method #2 essentially makes controls 2 & 3 clones of control #1. I could infer from this that any change I then made to any one of the controls would be reflected in all 3? Or is it just that changes to #1 (like additions or deletions from the list of tokens) will be  "copied" to the other two and any changes to either 2 or 3 will be copied only to itself and control #1?
Finally, which method is the best approach: method 1 above, or method 2? Or does it depend on desired behavior?
Thank you.

Hi There,

Can you please give us sample application or example to resolve above issue. 
Please find attached screenshot for the same. ("ScreenShot1.PNG" )

Hi Devexpress team !
I use this example to export to excel (
"> 
)
But each row of the pivot grid has to be in a different page to be printed.
Currently it just exports the grid just as the example and when I want to print it, it just displays the data continuously; 
I attached an image to let you know the idea of what I want to do. ghh 
 

Hello,
I have created an inherited version of SearchLookupEdit as described in 
.  I have a lot of SearchLookupEdit controls on a lot of forms.  I also have a lot of ImageComboBoxEdit controls.  I would like to switch all these controls over to use my CustomSearchLookupEdit, one by one, using the little tasks arrow on the control.  When I click it, I see the option for Change Editor Type.  My CustomSearchLookupEdit appears in the dropdown as one of the available editor types.  However selecting it does nothing.  How can I change an editor type to an inherited type without having to do search and replace in the designer generated code?  I would like to be able to change my controls one by one, using the designer.
Thanks !

Why when modifying a .docx document with the RichEditDocumentServer control, the properties of the document are modified.
Before editing: "Before.png"
After editing: "After.png "
or how can I change the "name" attribute of the image 

Hello,
I have SearchLookupEdit controls  in various places on forms.  I have tried setting the PopupFormSize.Width, and also BestFitMode to BestFitResizePopup.  In both cases, when the popup opens, I see it flash at the width I want for it, and then it immediately resizes to the width of the editor.  How can I have the popup be wider than the editor and stay that way?
Thanks! 


I think i can go with the report object parameter route for now, but its not exactly clear for me how i would go about prefilling the values of the report object parameter, and now show it to the user. I was expecting creating a instance of the report parameter object class and sending it somehow to the report preview method.
Preferably i would like to be able to define the report as an inplace report so that it shows in the toolbar of the apropriate object. The only thing is that i would like to force this either to be shown only if i go in detail view, of i force selection of just one row . So when i call the report from the associated object i would like to prefill the report parameter object values, and show the report directly.

Hi,
Whit my sucsription ASP.NET Web Forms (with devextreme) can i develop app for smartphone  Android and IOS ?
What version of devexpress do we need to develop an app for android and IOS cell phones?

I have a detailview which is effectively replicating a wizard control. It contains 4 tabs. I have added an ASPxButton to the first page. When I click this button, I want to select the second tab. How do I achieve this? It is relatively easy in WinForms, but doesn't seem as straight forward in the Web (ASPx). Here is my controller:
 

I'd followed the demo to get the data using Web API. First of all, I Implemented TreeListPartial with .Dat aSource(d  => d.WebApi.Controller("APIControllerName")) and then the action of controller drives into Model.cs to get data and return partialview with the model. Server-side send the data to client, but I found an issue in Client-side. the error message is 'Cannot read property 'createStore' of undefined'. I couldnot find the solution. Here are my codes.

I have a combobox with incremental filtering which seems to be adding spaces on either side of the matched substring during dislplay. See attached photo. This makes it hard to read. Is there a way to modify the behavior to ether eliminate the highlight entirely or highlight just the substring without adding any spaces to either side?
Here is my combobox:

I have a model with a DateTimeOffset property called CreateDate which shows when the user created a record.  In my model, I also expose an app-server-computed column that takes the logged-in user's physical location, determines the time zone, and converts the CreateDate property to a CreateDateUserTime property that is of DateTime type, and in the user's correct time.  I can then use this column in a GridView to display the proper time for the user.  The problem comes that I can't sort or filter based on this column because the GridView is using EntityServerMode due to the large amount of data in the table, and the column doesn't exist (and can't exist since it relies on the logged in user) in the database.
This column is very important to users in their usage of the grid, and so not being able to sort or filter by it becomes a problem.  My preference would be to have a way to directly sort or filter based on the CreateDateUserTime column.  Barring that, I'd like to display CreateDateUserTime but sort and filter based on the CreateDate column which is in the DB and have a custom converter when applying the filter to convert the entered date/time into the user's timezone.  Finally, if we can't do that, can we at least make it so that we can display the CreateDateUserTime column, but when sorting or filtering on that column it does so against the CreateDate column and we ignore the timezone aspect for now? 

We have a business object (EmploymentRecord) that can be linked to one or more objects representing skills (Skill) in a many to many relationship.  The Link / Unlink actions provided by the LinkUnlinkController are available from the EmploymentRecord_Skills_ListView and the Skill_EmploymentRecords_ListView. 
In our object model each EmploymentRecord belongs to exactly one Employee record (aggregated relationship). An employee (Employee) can have one or more Employment Records, of which only one can be active at any time. The active employment record is made available via the Employee.CurrentEmploymentRecord property.  We'd like to make it easy for the user to view / manage the skills linked to the employee's active employment record. We'd like to add an action to the Employee view controller to pop-up a dialog that lists all the skills associated with the employee's active employment record. The List Skills action we coded in the attached sample program partially works. It lists the associated skills but is missing the Link and Unlink actions that would allow the user to adjust the list of skills linked to the active employment record.  What must we do to enable these actions?

I am trying to Add/Update/Load/Delete a dashboard to my sql server database in the .NET Core Dashboard.  I have reviewed the examples for MVC and Webforms but since they are configured different for .NET Core I can't seem to get it to work.
Is there a technical document or instructions/examples how to setup and do it in .NET Core ?
Thanks in advance, 

I have a cxGridDBTableView column linked to a MemoField in a dataset. The column's Properties is set to PopupEdit, and the PopupControl is set to a cxDBMemo control on my form so that when the user clicks on the column, the editor opens to show the memo contents. All good. 
I? have also set the column's OnGetDisplayText event so that it displays the beginning of the MemoField's contents in the grid (instead of "(MEMO)"). Also good. 
E?XCEPT when the user clicks on a cell in the memo field column and the PopupEdit pops open, the selected item goes back to displaying "(MEMO)" instead of showing the MemoField contents. And this display value "(MEMO)" remains if the user closes the PopupEdit. It doesn't return to showing the MemoField contents until the user moves away from that record in the grid. 
?How can I keep the cell showing the value derived from the MemoField, whether the PopupEdit is activated or not? 

Hi Support,
I have several editors on my main bar that currently have a EditWidth value set.  This appears to be the MaxWidth for the editor.  I would like to be able t o specify a Minimum Width and then let the editor expand as the font size is changed.  How do I accomplish this task?

Hi,
I'm using Angular 5 with DevExtreme Angular
I currently have a button that invokes validation like this via the 'onClick'
 
One of the items being validated is a DxTextBox.    I have recently hooked the 'onEnterKey' from this component.
I cannot figure out how to invoke the validation group using the  event passed in.   In general how can I invoke the validation group for a page without it be directly called from a button.   Get it from the instance of the button?
Thanks,

Hi DevExpress Support,

Hello,
When I install  DevExpress VCL Controls v17.2.3 in Win 7 , I can not select the product that I want to install.Please have a look about the attachment. And Could you tell me why?Thank you very much!

There's an error at unit dxPScxGridLink, line 20815, finalization section
dxPSUnregisterReportLink(TdxGridReportLink, TcxGrid, TdxfmGridReportLinkDesignWindow);
that prevents the application from quitting (it closes the UI but remains as a process).
The message is attached. It only appears if debugging step-by-step inside the IDE, otherwise, as I said, it simply prevents the app from quiting completely.
It's a showstopper to me. I can't deliver a new version of my product with this bug.
Kind regards,
Marco

Hi, 
This issue was not found in v17.1.6. I attached a sample to illustrate the issue i found.  The case is a little bit complicated in order to reproduce it.
1. Click the 'Click me first' BUTTON
2. Select a row from the top data-grid. You will see the selectedRowKeys was printed at the bottom of the page.
3. Click the 'Click me after select a row in the data grid' BUTTON
 4. Select  a row from the top data-grid again. You will see nothing was printed at the bottom of the page, but i can get the correct value from console by $('#grid').dxDataGrid('instance').option('selectedRowKeys')
(You may try to switch the row selection multiple times. It will restore to normal after certain amount of retry.) 
If i don't follow the steps above, the dataGrid row selection seems to be normal...
If i removed the TabPanel from the page, the dataGrid also seems to be normal...

Dear Support Team,
I am trying to import an image into the dashboard  using binary array. May I know if the dashboards has a built-in function to convert an existing format into bit array and insert it into SQL or would it have to be stored locally and run through a URI link?
I would also want to get the images to corresponding to a value from the database accordingly. So example, with a value of 1 I get image 1, 2 I get image 2 and 3 I get image 3.
I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thanks! 

 In my wpf application, I need to hide the main window, which contains a RibbonControl, and re-show it after a while. After that, the bar item in quick access tool bar cannot update its Enabled status correctly while changing BarItem.IsEnabled property. Actually, in your demo app, this issue still exists. Just hide the RibbonControl and re-show it, and you can find this issue.

Hello, DevExpress support,
Please advice me how to adjust spacing between ribbon's PageHeaders items.
I need to place two controls onto ribbon's Page Header. 
These two controls should appear with very small distance between them.
Default distance is too big.
As I can see that distance comes from some BarEditItem's padding around contained edit.
Screenshot and sample project are in attached archive.

Hello, 
Is there a way to re-organize the items in report designer default toolbar? And I also want to put this BarButton Item IN THE MIDDLE of report group. 


Thank you, this has led me in the correct direction.  I've kind of got what I want sort of working, if it's ok I have just a couple of follow-on questions (maybe just clarifications from the documentation):
a) I'm confused by the documentation for the RepositoryItem structure.  In some places it states it applies to all controls of the same 'type' (e.g. if I change the settings it changes it for all of them), other places seem to indicate that each control has a local copy of the source.  I think it's the latter.  Long story short, is the only way to modify the behaviour accomplished by defining/manipulating a repositoryitem?  I've tried tweaking things in the constructor of the component itself (e.g. set specific properties in the constructor) but I seem to hit a timing issue where there is a properties object but it's not *the* properties object (e.g. the changes have no effect in the constructor but do have an effect in later code).


Thank you, this has led me in the correct direction.  I've kind of got what I want sort of working, if it's ok I have just a couple of follow-on questions (maybe just clarifications from the documentation):
b) Is there a good reference document on the internal layout/structure of the DevExpress components themselves?  I'm using this code from your solution but I need to include an animated image at certain times.  I thought I could just modify or add another button to the buttons list but the DevExpress button objects don't support animation.  So I need to insert a standard form image object into the component, for example, after the editor buttons list.  But I'm not entirely clear how to access the raw control set that makes up the PopupContainerEdit or how to manipulate its layout in a derived component instance.

I am talking about 
 handler.
I would like to be able to cancel a paste after it gets to that handler. I already know how to completely skip over that handler and others (see 
 ticket) , but at the point where I would be able to skip over it, the pasted content hasn't yet been "cleaned up" - if it was coming from word, for example, it would still be in a special format that would need to be translated into HTML 5. If I don't skip over your handler, the pasted content will enter the BeforePaste handler and will have been cleaned up by your code, but I have yet to discover a way to cancel the paste from inside that handler. This is important because for numerous reasons I would like to be able to inspect the cleaned up pasted content and then decide whether it should be allowed to be pasted or not. Thank you.

Hi DevExpress,
thank you for your amazing work and quick support. Let's have I look into the issue. Our project is consist from two parts. 
First part is windows service that is used as data provider. This part communicate with others via SignalR and is connected to database via XPO. 
Second part is application for presenting data. This application implementing GridControl. DataSource of it have to be provided from first application via SignalR.
 
What kind of data should be returned from SignalR method to get all functionality of GridControl (grouping, filtering etc.).
 
So is there any recommendation how to solve this issue ?  Or could you please provide an example solving this issue ? 

Hi,
I need some help in setting up a new app. I have spent a long time trying various controls, panels, and spilt containers and panels and it always ends up messy when the window is resized or maximized etc. 
Please take a look at the attachment which indicates what I am trying to achieve. I am generally aiming for a tabbed interface but the content of each tab must contain it's own nav bar and content area and it should all adapt reasonably to resizing. 
The only element that would be a fixed size is the control labelled 'XtraTab'. Note that the controls in the area to the right of the NavBar changes when NavBar items are selected. So I presume a user control needs to be used for that area (where XtraTab / Accordion control etc are located).
If my notes or the attached  pic is confusing let me know.
Thanks - Gerard

Hi,
I'd like to create form like this:
O   RADIO_OPTION_1                  [___INPUT_WHEN_OPTION_1_IS_SELECTED____] 
O   RADIO_OPTION_2                  [___INPUT_WHEN_OPTION_2_IS_SELECTED____]

So, I tried to use RadioButtonList instead but I cannot found any clue how to add textbox between RadioButton in RadioButtonList.
Could you provide me the solution?

Hello,
Please look at the attachment - first change of page causes very slow painting images on bottom buttons .
In our business application, we are using several similar controls on every page, and this situation occurs on every first page change.

I would like to set up a recurrent event that occurs, for example
every 5th day, every 15 minutes.
Can that be done using Xtrascheduler?
btw, I found those examples useful for setting up a simple recurrence, but I couldn't find something related to complex recurrence

Hi,
Sorry if the ticket title it's not very clear ..
My problem is:
I have a combo box, it's Data Source has 2 columns, id and description.
Both are String columns.
If the selected value is 5+ or 4-, when the combobox displays values formatted with DisplayFormat string, in one case the 5+ becomes 5, in the other case 4- becomes -4.
But if I click and open the combobox's dropdown, the displayed values becomes correct.
I can't understand what i have to do to solve this.

Hello, I need to load the DataSource of a grid from an async function, and to do this i use the RegisterAsyncTask to register it. But when I use the RegisterAsyncTask, the OnClick events of eventual ASPxButtons in the GridView are not fired when the buttons are clicked. If I load the DataSource without the RegisterAsyncTask, the events are fired. Is there a way to make the events fire even if I use the RegisterAsyncTask? I attach a sample project.
Kind Regards.

Hello Experts, 
We recently upgraded DevExpress Version 17.25 for our application. 
But we noticed that ColorDataMember does not display the bindable color property. Earlier version (17.1.4) it was working well. 
We have Series ItemSource, where ArgumentDataMember, ValueDataMember and ColorDataMember are associated to predefined properties with BarSideBySideStackedSeries2D. 
Ex) 
We want to display some specific colors, but currently it shows all default colors. 
The color property type is System.Windows.Media.Color
 Please guide me how to fix the issue. 
Best Regards

Hi
 I had some weird situations while testing your permission system (allow/deny).
I use XPO and connect to an MS SQL server with two defines business objects; "Person " (employee) and "Abteilung" (department).
These BO's has a one-to-many -relationship, which means, an employee is in one department and a department can have zero or many employees.
I used the standard security role s "Administrator" and "Default" and configured the role "Default" as follows:
- Permission Policy: Deny  all by default
- Navigation Permissions: Personalverwaltung (whole group) => allow
- Type Permissions: Abteilung => read-only
No specific rule for BO "Person", so i except, the common permission policy (deny all by default ) will affect.
The following problems occured with an user which has only the role "Default" assigned.
When I open the ListView for "Person", I can read the column "Name".
Because I don't defined any specific rules for BO "Person", I expected a text like "secured content" (common permission policy of role "Default").
When I open the detail view for BO "Abteilung" , all seems to be okay, but I don't know why.
In my productive solution, I have the problem, that the security hasn't any effect to nested listviews , when it is allowed to create new records directly within the listview (NewItemRow).
I also checked the views with your diagnostic tool, but didn't find anything:
 
As you can see, the item with key "HasRightsToModifyMemberController" for the property editor "Personen" (nested listview) gives back the value "True". Why is this value set to "True", when the permission to BO "Person" denies all activities and the BO "Abteilung" is read-only? In my opinion, this are two reasons why this value should be set to "False". 

Hi,
is it possible to set min and max value for a Argument and Value Axis in data source?
In stead of this:
            .ArgumentAxis(a => a
                .Grid(g => g.Visible(true)).Min(-12).Max(12).TickInterval(3)
            )
            .ValueAxis(a => a.Add().TickInterval(3).Min(-12).Max(12))
To have 
            .ArgumentAxis(a => a
                .Grid(g => g.Visible(true)).Min("XMIN").Max("XMAX").TickInterval(3)
            )
            .ValueAxis(a => a.Add().TickInterval(3).Min("XMIN").Max("XMAX"))
and to set these parameters XMIN and XMAX in datasource and just load them?
thank you!

Hi,
Now the following is fixed,
I've implemented the buttons in the dropDownAppointmentTemplate. I've noticed that if you call a dxPopup from a button within the template, the z-index seems to be incorrectly worked out meaning the template dropdown is always on top. I need the popup to be on top or as a work around, close for now.
Please see the attached demo project of this behaviour. In the desktop project, click the scheduler "1 More " button in the month view to show the drop down template. Click the edit (pencil icon) button. See dxPopup is incorrectly shown behind. If you click a normal booking and use the edit button, the popup is correctly shown on top of the popover.

Hi,
We have generated a .docx  file from xtrareport by using the code like below, 
In local environment its working fine I am able to open the generated file using Microsoft Office. But same file when generated on production server gives error as shown in attached image. Though file gets opened if I click Yes from prompted window shown in attach image.
Just wanted to know if it has any dependency on other software which is available in my local machine that's why file is getting opened and that solfware is missing at production causes this kind of error.

Hello,
i´d like to use alternating background colors for ListBoxItems while using different Themes.
It seems that the alternating background colors are not defined in the Themes? Is that right?
Should i define the alternating background colors in the Themes Editor?
If i define them myself, like the code below, it works, but it doesn´t look of course very nice with every theme...

Hello DevExpress,
I have a dashboard for testing purposes, which contains allmost all dashboard elements for testing purposes. I think 4x4 dahsboard items where every item  is different configured. And there are also the four different map types. By clicking on the dashboard export function, the application hangs.
After I attached the debugger I found out it was because of a deadlock, which I think occures in the export rendering routines of the map controls. 
Within the textfile I provided the callstack of the main thread and futher down all threads, including their callstacks.

Hi Team,
We have a WPF application based on  the Pivot Grid (current version is 16.2.11) showing quite a lot of data. Users change the columns setup a lot and the amount of RAM consumed grows a lot when there's much data to aggregate. I can't share the original code, but I have created a sample to demonstrate the problem.
Initially there're 3 columns added to the row area and 5 to the data area.  4 more columns is available to add to the data area.
Hitting the button on the top will generate 400k records and load them to the grid. The memory consumption goes up to 500-600 MB. Adding one more column to the data area makes it grow to almost 700 MB (screenshot 1).
In the production application the numbers are much larger (ie the "normal" consumption is 1.5 GB , but if you add more columns it can grow up to 4-5 GB and the performance gets very poor).
I have analyzed the memory consumption with dotMemory and it looks like the largest part of it is taken by PivotSummaryValue objects (screenshot 2) .
Please advise if there's a way to optimize the performance. 
The project and the screenshots are in the attached archive. The code is also available here:
Thanks!

Hello. 
1. When you try to move the rectangle, which describes the value of a formula occurs Access Violation. 
2. Deleting columns are not displayed correctly in the formula value. 
And Question
How to hide the selection of the values of the formula, if the focus is not on the formula? 

Let's consider a scenario when the chart's data is updated at realtime (e.g., using a timer) and the axis zooming option is enabled. When an end-user zooms in to see detailed data and then zooms out to the initial zoom level to see all points, the axis range is not reset to the automatic mode. This means that newly added points will not be visible by default and it will be necessary to perform the zoom out operation once again to see all points (including the newly created ones) or set the VisualRange.Auto property at runtime.
A more convenient behavior is to automatically enable the automatic range adjustment mode once an end-user sets the maximum zoom level.

Hi,
I am currently running my project on V16.1.5 and it works ok but am trying to upgrade to V17.2.5 and the graphs in group footer display blank or causes object reference not set to an instance of an object error .

I am just creating a new report by wizard and connecting to a sql server database and using a stored procedure with some data in the detail section and a group header and footer with the graph in the footer.

Ive included a screenshot to show you two Grids side-by-side, visually there is a clear difference but the ColumnPanelRowHeight both reports as 30 when tested

I have a number of forms in my app which are simple XtraForms and don't need a RibbonControl on them. They do however need a STATUSBAR on them (to show some simple status text and a size-grip for the form) so at the moment I'm just using a native Windows StatusBar.
The problem?
The Windows StatusBar looks bad with DevEx skinning, so what I really need is a RibbonStatusBar but without a RibbonControl (which is overkill for these small forms).
I appreciate the we can't have a stand-alone RibbonStatusBar, but please can you tell me how to best "approximate" this with your other controls (e.g. a PanelControl, a LabelControl and something showing a sizing grip for the form)?

Hello,
We are building an app using DevExtreme framework, and we need to use Xtra reports in it.

I'm adding little test project with that issue, maybe you can pinpoint where is the problem?

Hi Dev Express.
In my application, I need to show appointements that have a very short duration in a TimeLine view.
I have already set the SnapToCellsMode property to AppointmentSnapToCellsMode.Disabled (and I really need appointments to be displayed on the same line).
The documentation says that in this case, the minimum width is one pixel. But, according to the time scale I select, my appointments are hidden.
I'd like that they stay always visible.
How an I do that ?
Thank you.

Hello,
our company provide a Visual Studio Extension that uses UI elements from DevExpress (WPF). We discovered problems if the extension user uses a second extension with another DevExpress version than ours (e.g. Code Review Assistant with DevExpress 14.2). If both extensions are used we are not able to open our dialogs with DevExpress. No exception or error message is displayed. As an experiment we removed all DevExpress Control from one dialog and the problem disappears. 
Is this issue known? Are there any solutions?
Best regards

Hi,
I need the spreadsheet to be displayed without the "headers" a typical spreadsheet has (0/1/2 and A/B/C) and have set ShowColumnHeaders="False" ShowRowHeaders="False".
Nevertheless, I need the columns to be resizable with mouse by dragging them on the divider line between the single columns.
In principle, it is the same requirement as somebody requested already for winforms grid, See 
.
1. Am i right this will not work out of box ?
2. An approach could be to manually intercept mouse-events (mouse move and click) and implement manually.
However, I am not able to determine if I am "on or next to a" column boundary. Consider the following snippet:
How can I get the screen position of a cell (Not logical like "A2", but current view pixels,e.g. relative to control scroll range start, like (Rect Left=20, Top=20, Width=200; Heigh=10). Or - even better - for a column ?
Goal is to calculate the distance to column border this way (If next to it, change mouse cursor).
This should also work e.g. when scrolling, so just sum up columns PixelWidth is no alternative.
3. Any other idea how to achieve this - > is important for further usage of control.
Thank you for your feedback,
Daniel



the way they hottrack is also different
If you look at the button under the cursor in the attached image, you see that only the left line is in yellow, the rest stay as blue. Also the button is 19 wide
But if you run the XtraEditors demo and look at Inplace Grid CellEditors, you see that all lines should be yellow when hot-tracked. The button is 20 wide.
It seems that maybe VGrid is showing editor buttons narrower than they should be and also not hot tracking them properly.

Hi,
I need a RichEditControl  on a server application (a win32 service, no gui) to process a RTF document and export the result in PDF format.
I instantiate the control with 
      RichControl := TdxRichEditControl.Create(nil);
But I get an access violation in this line.
In a test environment, like a standard VCL application or even a command-line application it works just fine.
As said the application runs as a win32 service, has no gui. Also, the code runs in a new thread for each client request
Is this the right approach, or I have better options ?
Thanks in advance!

Hello,
my question is, if you see an alternative to  TcxDBGridColumn - OnGetProperties event?
Our problem is, that in our application data to TcxBridDBTableView are loaded, the number of lines is not fix, varying between 10 and max. 500.
We have 4 columns, ID, text, datatype and the fourth column  is the one, which can be edited by the user. And here we use OnGetProperties to set the editor depending on datatype-column. So, the datatype can be different from record to record... And, what I should mention, a special datatype requires a SQL-statement, asking the database to fill a drop-down list, so in this case we can not use a defined TcxRepositoryItem, but we create one at run time.
With this implementation, the loading of data into the TcxBridDBTableView is (depending on the number of records) somestimes very slow.
Do you have an idea how to change the implementation, probably we could use a different component to solve this issue?
Thank you in advance,
best regards,
Christoph

When creating a dialog though the ModuleManager,  the first time the created viewmodel is used, creating the dialog for the second time doen't use the new viewmodel, it reuse the previous viewmodel.
How is it possible to show the dialog with a new viewmodel?

For example, if the Dialog button has a parameter, how can this value be passed to the viewmodel?

I have looked in the documentation and calling the reset() method is not having any effect. I have downloaded the sample as in a previous thread and that one works correctly using the reset() method, but it's datasource is a simple array and not a custom store ( with paging filtering etc... )
So my question is how do I  reset the lookup when it is supplied data from a custom store?
thanks in advance 

Hi,
 
We have a product where we allow the user to bring up the Chart Wizard (see 
) to customize the chart. The product is developed using DevExpress WinForms. 
 
Now we have a similar product under development, where we use DevExpress WPF instead. Is there any way to bring up the Chart Wizard in WPF? Or is there another way for the end-user to customize the chart?

Dear Devexpress,
I get  exception from ArdornerUI component, when a Guide Element target is a BarButtonItem with BeginGroup = true property.
The exception occurs when i set the ShowGuides property to True.
Please start the program and click the Start Tutorial button.
 
Please look at the problem.
 

Under certain circumstances I need to load a popup editor lookup with values different from initial values - I finally got this to work (except for the lookup initially showing the key and not the value - I will submit a separate ticked for this).
The issue is that this will not work for the popup editor: as pictured in the attached image - the issue appears to be connected with the fact that a second instance of the lookup drop-down field is created for the popup mirroring the underlying grid lookup field- because the underlying lookup DOES get the new lookup values  - but the popup editor lookup I specify does not.
I am doing this using this (essentially):
 

Thank you very much that worked like a charm.
Based on the same lines, is there a better way to save the grip layout with a name on click of a button and then display the list of Saved grid layouts with name and load it.
How can this be done with the above approach on click of the bookmark button. Any help is appreciated.
Thanks

Hi,
I have upgraded my application from MVC4 to MVC5  but I am getting a run time error as below:
An exception of type 'System.TypeAccessException' occurred in System.Web.Mvc.dll but was not handled in user code
Additional information: Attempt by security transparent method 'DevExpress.Web.Mvc.UI.HtmlHelperExtension.DevExpress(System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper`1<!!0>)' to access security critical type 'System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper`1<ModelType>' failed.

Can you please suggest what could be the issue and how to solve it? 

Hello DevExpress Team,
 we added some SvgImages into the svgImageCollection16:   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  How can we determine the number of entries. As an example we need to copy and transform the images into a ImageCollection.

Hello DevExpress Team,
we need to load SvgImages from external referenced assemblies. Will you add such a feature in the future?

Hi,
 I overrode SetValueBeforePost() of TcxSchedulerDBStorage in a derived class to set specific field values.
I was a bit confused about this, so I set the Rangechecks OFF, and everything went fine
I couldn't find any explanation for this. AItemIndex seems to be correct.
 Why do I need to put Rangechecks OFF here?

We're in the process of evaluating Dashboards for our application. The tool looks very nice but one thing I'm trying to figure out is if it's possible to only allow access to a specific schema in our database when the user builds a data source. The database that the user has access to is very large and the user shouldn't have access to probably 95% of it when creating dashboards. The simple solution would seem to be create a dashboard schema in the database that includes table, view and stored procedures that the user can include in their data source while hiding the rest of the database to them. Is this possible?

Maxim, I really appreciate your time to look into this.  I modified the above sample to show this issue by adding the following setting:
scrolling: {
           mode: "infinite"
        },
Steps to repo:
There is also another issue that I am seeing:
1) Change the setting loadPanel.enabled to false, save and reload the sample page and grid.
2) Use the grid scroll bar to scroll down and load a complete data set
3) 
: The loading indicator is still shown at the bottom of the grid during the loading operation.  Isn't loadPanel.enabled = false supposed to completely disable showing of the loading indicator?  If not, how can the loading indicator be completely disabled from appearing?

So this is related to some other tickets ive written but i think it need to be separate.
So i have a report, that has a sqlDataSource that gets its data from a stored procedure with 2 parameters.
Those 2 params of the stored procedure are mapped to 2 parameters of the report.
If i set Visible=true to the report params, and set them when trying to preview (at runtime), everything is ok.
I then create a report parameter object and assign it to the mentioned report. I set the report parameters to Visible=false.
When i click the report, i get the ui of the report param object, i set them, then click preview.
I want to set the values of the parameters  of the report with the values from the report parameter object.
So i have this link : 
It says here that i need to set the report parameters in the BeforePrint event, but the problem is that i get an error about populating the datasource, and it never reaches the BeforePrint event.
I tried to access the report parameter in the  DataSourceDemanded event, but the value of the report parameter object is not set yet.
So  the DataSourceDemanded is to early to access the report parameter object, and BeforePrint is to late.
What can i do ? How can i set the report parameters before the report tries to execute the procedure (because that is what it seems its happening) 

I want to call an event on checkbox click in a devexterme grid cell.and add a new row in that event which will copy selected row data in a new row.

Hi -
The format button is missing when I select a text field.  However, if I select a numeric field the format button is available.  I've attached a screen shot.  How do I get the format button to appear when selecting a text field?
I appreciate the help.

Attached is a report developed using devexpress  reports, if the report is zoomed to 600% the grid lines in the report are not crisp, they tend to have a shadow, can this shadow be removed.

This exception seems to be already fixed in the 17.1.8+, but is stil present in the 16.2.11 (maybe 16.2.12 as well)
What do you suggest?
Thanks in advance.

I had also mentioned about issue with date column in my first query(the selected date is not highlighted in filter popup instead today’s date is highlighted.). Is there a way where we can highlight all the populated dates(populated under Date Column) in the pop up?
 I have modified the solution to demonstrate the issue. The zip file also contains DateHighlightIssue.png file showing the issue. let me know if you need more info.

Rahul

This approach works perfectly fine.
In this case, we still need your input for below scenario,
1. If grid contains 10 records and we click mouse (between 1to10 rows) on blank place at right side of  last removed column ,       row get selected. 
    How we can avoid this row selection?
2.  As this even fires all the time, performance issue comes. 
     How can we avoid firing this event all the times?
 

Hi
How do I display a tooltip for a WPF grid cell?   I've looked at 
, but it references a non-existent GridColumn attributes, CellToolTipBinding and CellToolTipTemplate.  The closest existing attribute is just called ToolTip, but that unsurprisingly doesn't result in a tooltip being displayed.
Unfortunately as usual, actual working documentation and examples have been hidden by DevExpress and the implementation made needlessly complex to prevent users from using the controls without submitting support tickets.

When changing the timezone on the Scheduler the current time indicator still shows local time, not the timezone that was selected.

Hello,
I have a scenario where I have an event that happens every day but participants change. For example, weekday work shift from 8 am to 5 pm with 400 employees. List of employees changes from day to day due to employees taking leave, moving to a different shift, etc. I thought that the most intuitive way to handle it is to create recurring event and change resources for each occurance. Since it is not possible, what is the best way to achieve it besides creating separate event for each day? 

Hello,
We ran into an issue where the View Variants Module does not take different Data Access Modes into consideration between views. As the documentation states:
Each View Variant can have an individual 
 value (see 
), but this value is ignored. Instead, the value specified for the root varied View is used for all variants.
 In most cases this makes sense, however, if the variant view's List Editor does not support the data access mode, the collection should be recreated using the new mode. Alternatively, before switching the view, a check should be done to ensure the new editor supports the root data mode and throw a friendly exception if it does not - and prevent the view from being changed.
In our scenario, we have a large list of calendar items that can be displayed in a GridListEditor with reasonable loading time in Server Mode. However, the variant for the SchedulerListEditor needs to load in Client Mode. When switching between these variants, an exception occurs and the user is stuck.
While we can do this ourselves with a controller, I'm making the suggestion to provide this capability out of the box.
Thanks!

Hi,
I am using XtraReport control to show report.
I have one total which is report total. I need to show another total after discounts     
My net total line is XrLabel11.  I am setting below code after i calculated totals.
Private Sub cTotBid_SummaryCalculated(sender As Object, e As TextFormatEventArgs) Handles cTotBid.SummaryCalculated
        If Me.XrLblCapShipName.Text = "INVOICE FOR:" Then
            ReportBidTotal = ClsCommon.ZCDbl(e.Value)
            Me.XrLabel11.Text = (ReportBidTotal-RBMain.AgreedPC.Amount).ToString("N2")
        End If
   End Sub
This code is not updating the label text .
Could you please explain how to achieve this. 

Hello,
We are stuck with a problem in DevExpress end user designer report . I am creating a report on the basis of datasets provided by Sql procedure.
Our requirement to facilitate user to group data(provided by dataset) as per his/her requirement .  We have gone through your documents but unable to find such used case. Although we do get example of group wise segregation of data with the help of Group Header Band but there is no real time example which can show grouped data with aggregate(Sum, Count, Avg etc.) functions applied.
Can you tell me if DevExpress provides this feature to make end user capable of doing group by with aggregation. 
Below is our problem statement:
We get data from a dataset:
User  Browser     IP         LoginDate
 1       Chrome   x.x.x.x   10-Jan-2017
2       Chrome   x.x.x.x    11-Jan-2017
 1       Mozilla     x.x.x.x   10-Jan-2017
2       Mozilla     x.x.x.x    11-Jan-2017
 1       Safari       x.x.x.x   10-Jan-2017
2       Safari       x.x.x.x    11-Jan-2017
Expected result that we need from report viewer is as below:

An empty Detail band should be added to the opened report automatically if the report has no Detail band specified.

In the latest build the code in the cxLookAndFeels.pas file was modified as follows
  cxDefaultIsTouchScrollUIModeEnabled = {$IFDEF USETOUCHSCROLLUIMODEASDEFAULT}True{$ELSE}False{$ENDIF};
  ...
  cxDefaultLookAndFeelNativeStyle = {$IFDEF USENATIVELOOKANDFEELASDEFAULT}True{$ELSE}False{$ENDIF};
I tried setting and/or resetting the compiler directive(s) at project level, but it did not do anything. 
 {$Define USETOUCHSCROLLUIMODEASDEFAULT} 
or
{$UnDef USETOUCHSCROLLUIMODEASDEFAULT}
What is the recommended procedure for setting  the default mode for non touch clients?  Set or unset one or both and  where exactly?
Thanks

Greetings,
Please find attached ScreenCasts to demonstrate the issue(s) I am facing and the 
 I've created for demonstration
Ref. 
I've tried to demonstrate that initially, when the (map) box loads, the map isn't displayed. After clicking a few times, the map controls show up and then further, when I click on the 
 button, the map shows up in the full screen view and after clicking 
keyboard button, the map now shows up in the box.
Ref. 
this issue is in continuation to the above, where the map isn't loaded up even after a location is entered until the full screen is toggled.
The Map is being displayed over a HTML popup. 
Also, in addition to the above, I would also like to check whether the map information (as displayed in google's search result) is available for us to access (ref. highlighted area in 
)

I note that with horizontal scroll bars set (Auto in our case) the columns don't auto-width themselves in the grid.
However that is exactly what we would like to see!
Is there any way of getting at least the 'minimum' width needed for the column header to display correctly with the text + filter/sort icon etc.

I am having an issue where items in a layout are not shown properly for the data type. Attached is a screen shot of my layout. All of the verify fields and sub-total fields are boolean data types. When I run the program they are shown as check boxes. When I do the layout, however, they are shown at character fields. Also, I have experienced issues where items not shown in the layout tree appear at the bottom of my form in a seemingly random position. Finally, The ability to add splitters, etc. has disappeared from the customization box. Only the empty item and any hidden fields from the model are shown in the list. There used to be a splitter and separator as options as well.

I have a Data Grid on a web page that tells users how many parts they currently have, and how many parts they still need. However, users want to be able to print this page and have it automatically filter out rows where 0 parts are needed. They only want a printout of the parts they need.
I've added a mockup of the "normal" (web page) view vs. the print view for clarification.
How can I change the filter on the Data Grid based  on whether the page is being printed? 

Hello,
How do I remove space between TabControl border and content (picture)? I don't want any distance between tab content and control borders.
I believe it should be padding in

I've also tried to change values in
x:Key="{dxt:DefaultStyleThemeKey FullName=DevExpress.Xpf.Core.DXTabControl}"
(TabItem.xaml and TabContent.xaml), but it doesn't help.
I am using it in MVVM pattern and it is bound to VM's.

New in 17.2.5 !
A filter on the column before grouping has an undesired effect.
The type of filter (eg, Is greather than) has disappeared (Equal is applied).
Result, the grid is emptied.
See doc in attachment to reproduce it.

Is there a way to export only the selected rows from a WinForms grid control?
Of course I would want to maintain the formatting, the filtering, and the visible columns as well.
Thanks!

Hello, we've been trying the Skin Editor, but we could not figure out how it works.
After some trial and error, we've man aged to get some insight, but we're still lacking what we believe is probably some basic knowledge..
Our current objective is to change the global highlight color.
For instance: When we hover over a Large Ribbon Button, we want its background color to change to a different color than just a darkened version of its original background color.
Same goes for the checked state of Check Items in the ribbon bar and selected values in a backstage page menu
We've tried changing the Highlight Color properties under Common -> System Colors -> Highlight , but It does not seem to change anything.
We've also tried looking at Ribbon -> Buttons -> Large Button. But we cannot find a way to change the color of individual states.
If you could please give us some insight , we'd be much obliged

Hello.
I started using your WebChartControl for a project i have and after some reading and practice i managed to  create and manipulate at run time using a custom dataset, the View, Series, Argument and Values of the chart based on values from some comboboxes and a radiobutton.
Everything works fine but the problem is that when i change the View to Pie the values on the legend are shown in '%'
I have attached a video that demonstrates the above problem and also below you can see the code i'm using to initialize the WebChartControl.
Probably i'm missing something out, or the Pie chart is working differently from the rest.
Based on the video, how i can replace the % on the legend with Months(like Bar View) and if possible to show value instead of % on Pie chart. 
Best regards, 
Christos .

Hi, 
I am trying to change property captions at runtime based on another propertys value. 
Simple i have a Master object with single property named 'Year'. 
And i have a non persistent object which has a reference to master object.

I want to change those properties captions to 2017 / January, 2017 / February .... and so on when the NonPersistentObject.MasterObject property changed. 
I have attached a simple project that shows my issue and how i did try to do the required task. 
To see problem on sampel; 
1- Run the program. 
2- Select first (2016) record on the MasterObject ListView
3- Click the SAmple Action to invoke the Non Persistent object's DetailView. 
4- See that Month Captions didnt change. They are : MONTH 1, MONTH 2, MONTH 3 and so on..
5- Dont close the detailview and SELECT the 2017 master object. See that the captions changed like 2016 / JANUARY, 2016 / FEBRUARY .. and so on. This is wrong they were must be the initial caption when the detailview shown. 
6. Dont close the detailview and SELECT the 2018 master object. Note that the captions didnt change again. 
7- Dont close the detailview and SELECT the 2016 master object. See that the captions changed like 2017 / JANUARY, 2017 / FEBRUARY .. and so on

Currently my grid is in batch edit mode. So if I click "save changes", then I make changes to all the rows currently in the grid.
Is it possible for me to update my whole grid at once instead of page by page?
Example:
I have 113 rows, and 50 rows per page, so 3 pages total. Is it possible to navigate between pages without saving data, and then click "save changes" to update all 3 pages at once? 

I tried hard to find the property in SkinEditor where to change the color of the TextHint of a TcxComboBox. For the case it's not a skinned color I even hooked up windows' GetSysColor to change everything into red, but the TextHint-Color didn't changed. Can you hint me into the right direction? Thanks.
In the attached image you can see, that the text hint is not readable in the lighter theme.

Hi,
A client of ours wants to use DevExpress Report Server for some reporting needs.
However, when they try to run the installer on the machine they want to install it on, nothing happens. No error or anything, it just refuses to run.
Their IT administrator says it most likely has something to do with their anti-virus setting. Is this something known to give problems with DevExpress installers? 
If so, is there any way for them to get around this so they can actually install the software?
Thanks in advance.
 

Can you tell me where to find source code for the Mail Client Demo?
Or, let me know what controls are used on the Info page to provide support links in groups?
Thank you.

The Values can be edited, but the DisplayText is always "null"
 [CaptureSelectCell.png]
however when I enter edit mode, the Value is displayed correctly, I can also edit it and the value is also correctly set
 [CaptureEditMode.png]
when the edit mode is exited, null will be displayed again.
the same behaviour is without handling CustomDisplayText(empty cell instead of "null")

Dear support,
I got a question on the GridView control.
How do I get the value of a control which sits in a DataItemTemplate , in an event like a button click (but no button in the grid or a grid-event)?
For example my GridView:
I have now in my webpage a button which fires a server-event (regular ASP.NET button). And in that button, I wanna know if the checkbox was checked or not.
With a regular ASP.NET Gridview I could now do something very easy like:
And then checking for each row if "chk" is checked or not.
However, I can't find anything similar in the DevExpress Gridview.
I know that there's the function FindRowCellTemplateControl but that function returns the checkbox always in state false (unchecked) even if it was checked. 
Seems like the DevExpress does not save anything in the ASP.NET Viewstate? 
I already tried rebinding everything in the Page_Load (without the function FindRowCellTemplateControl or even GetRow would always return null) but of course that doesn't help because after the rebind the states of the controls get refreshed.
Is there any way to get the correct checked state of my control? 
I can't imagine that DevExpress GridView can't do something that easy.
Thanks very much,
Sebastian
 

I am trying to show my own popup instead of your right-click menu, which is fine. But I have a problem when you right-click a cell, let's say, which open's the popup, then you right click again off the popup on another cell, it doesn't re-select the new cell. What is the best way to fix this? This wants to select the new cell/appointment each time?
I have attached a sample project.

Hello,
I'm having an issue with the DXRibbonWindow title showing over the context  RibbonPageCategory's. The problem seems to only exist when the RibbonPageCategory's come from a MDI Merged ribbon.
I've created a quick sample project showing the issue i'm encountering. I'm using a DockLayoutManager for the MDI container. The main window has a custom category on it, and the title correctly bounces around the category as it should. However, as soon as the user control is added to the DockLayoutManager, its RibbonPageCategories are merged into the main window. The title doesn't seem to obey the rules for avoiding being over the category for merged categories and interferes with the  category caption.
 Check out the attached project, click the Add button on the first category to add the control to the DockLayoutManager. Maybe I'm missing something.

Hello - I am building a grid from code behind and my add column function looks like this:
Protected Sub SetGridColumns(ByVal grd As ASPxGridView, ByVal grdColumnCaption As String, ByVal grdFieldName As String, ByVal grdDisplayFormatString As String, ByVal bShowInCustomizationForm As Boolean, bIsVisible As Boolean)
        Dim bField As DevExpress.Web.GridViewDataTextColumn = New DevExpress.Web.GridViewDataTextColumn
        bField.Caption = grdColumnCaption
        bField.FieldName = grdFieldName
        bField.Visible = bIsVisible
        If grdDisplayFormatString <> "" Then
            If grdDisplayFormatString = "d" Then
                bField.PropertiesEdit.DisplayFormatString = grdDisplayFormatString
            Else
                bField.PropertiesEdit.DisplayFormatString = "M/d/yyyy"
            End If
        End If
        bField.ShowInCustomizationForm = bShowInCustomizationForm
        If bShowInCustomizationForm = False Then
            bField.Settings.AllowDragDrop = DevExpress.Utils.DefaultBoolean.False
            bField.Settings.AllowGroup = DevExpress.Utils.DefaultBoolean.False
        End If
        grd.Columns.Add(bField)
    End Sub
all works fine until I have a column that are dates - its not sorting it correctly - itsonly sorting by the month (first) number?
 

Hi, I am having some difficulty with the GridView object. Nothing I have tried has successfully Changed the Backcolor of the Column headers.
I don't understand why these devex objects are sometimes so SOOO difficult to work with. 
One example is the styling option to set a header back color should not take a masters degree in devexpress objects to be able to make simple changes. Seriously someone there should rethink that. Anyway clearly I'm missing some switch hidden/buried 5 layers deep to make this work. 
Can anyone tell me how to set the backcolor of a column header at runtime in code?
Below is some of the code I have tried in the on load of the form. None of the code below changes the backcolor but the forecolor works fine.
 

Hi Aleks,
meanwhile I spend nearly 4 month (YES, more than a quarter of a year) making test programs, code snipped, testdata, videos etc. I have to make money with the development of our own software. But in the moment I spend all the time for troubleshooting of software-products that we have buyed because it should take over work, not create additionaly some.
To rescue the honor: Troubleshooting DevExpress was the smallest part of the 4 month. But considered overall we cannot afford that with only 2 developers.
For now enough of grumbling - back to our problem. For this week I am out of the office and therefore I can only test something in the evening and in the hotel. 
1. XtraOpenFileDialog is working 
2. treelistdemo is working
3. DialogsMainDemo 
   - Open - is working
   - Save As - is working
   - Set Working Folder - FAILS !!!
4. Not enough time to do that
There are no related Events in the viewer
What we can do is a remote session on my computer end of the week. What do you think about it? 

I need to customize a  ASPxButton from a specific cell to visible = false or true depending on a criteria.
I'm using the component below:
Can I do this on DevExpress in codebehide?
Tks 

 does what I want ALMOST.  
I have updated the solution to loop through the grid so that every row is updated. 
The issue I am having is that it only updates rows on the current page.  Is there a way to have it update every row even if it is not on the current page? 

Hi 
I have a lisboxcontrol inside a popupcontainercontrol. I am trying to launch a popup menu (with Edit, Delete, etc.) when I right click on a record in the listboxcontrol . The popup menu opens up, but the popupcontainercontrol closes. Is it possible to keep it open?
Thanks!

i have a ribbon control and docklayoutmanager in my wpf mainwindow...
i have it set up to allow me to drag a document from the window and dock it onto the desktop or just leave it floaing,..
the problem i am having, is if i have '2' documents open, 1 is floating or docked on the desktop, the other is docked within the mainwindow,...
if i select the floating ( or desktop docked ) document, then click on a command or checkbox, basically anywhere on the ribbon, 
it will change the active document from the floating document to the document within the mainwindow, 
my goal is to NOT have the ribbon change document activity ( focus etc... ) when clicking on it...
basically if i don't select the document via mouse or ctrl+tab, then the document should not get focus...
any help would be appreciated :)...
Thanks,
Dan

 What am I suppose to do?

I want my gridView to automatically expand the selected row and automatically select the expanded row. I want there to be at most one expanded+selected row at a time. I'd like, if possible, to avoid having to do several server round trips to accomplish this.
In short, if the user clicks anywhere on the row, I want it to select the row and expand it's detail area (and collapse any existing expanded areas) and if the user clicks on any of the expand icons, I want to expand and select the row (and deselect any other rows).

HI!
How to check / uncheck all columns on CheckListBox doing a click in a single button like example attached, please? 

Hello,
I have a custom theme inherited from Mater ial Compact. I've noticed the ripple (which appears on click) color is sometimes gray, while sometimes it's the base color of my theme. Those ripples are hard to capture for inspect tools, so maybe you can show me a way to change their color everywhere in a centralized way with a few CSS rules?

I have a datagrid that is grouped by a column. We have a requirement that one entire grouping may be deleted. Is there a way to put, let's say a button on the grouping that I could bind to an method to remove everything in that group?

I have reports with subtotals. When a zero subtotal is calculated, I'd like to print a blank or print nothing in the XRLabel. 
I've tried a variety of things, like using SummaryReset, SummaryRowChanged and SummaryGetResult to change the text to a blank when the total is zero. But the zero total on my report still prints a zero.
Is there a simple way to do this? It seems like there should be a numeric format for this. It would be very helpful if there were.
Thank you for your help.
 

Hi,
I'm building a timeline Scheduler similiar to your exemple here:
I'm using the "onOptionChanged" method to find out when the users changes the "currentDate" or the "currentView". However. I wanted to know wich date did he change to. 
For exemple: If I am on "timelineWeek" or "timelineMonth" in March and change to "timelineDay" I want to know to witch day it will change to.
If I try to do "getStartViewDate()" it will only work after the "onOptionChanged" is finished.
Is there any way I can obtain this information?
Thank you.

In the VerticalGrid, if the caption of a category row is left unassigned (intentionally, to get a separator row with no text), the name of the row is displayed at runtime, e.g. 
.
If spaces are entered as the caption, at runtime  there is a dotted border around them.
 

i have created a gridview with search panel and GridViewCommandColumn . when a i click on  a command and then use search panel the search panel repeat the last call back of the command (open a window) . how to clear the last call back previous to execute the search panel. and not to repeat the call back of the GridViewCommandColumn 
I have read something about APPLYSEARCHPANELFILTER DevExpress.Web.Scripts
how can i catch this variable on ClientSideEvents 

Hi,
This is a strange one; I have an applcation that was first written in XE6  & now ported (successfully I thought) to Berlin.
In this application I am unable to add new commands to the TdxBarManager .  As soon as I press the Modify... button and my mouse hovers over the "Add" menu item, I get an Access Violation.
I can compile the application, but when my mouse hovers over any TdxBar button (large or small) the Access Violation occurs again (so I'm mostly unable to press any bar buttons)
The message details and call stack from the MadExcept bugreport is below.   I have managed to replicate the issue by creating a new VCL forms application, and adding 3 units from the original application ---  note that the app doesn't compile, but you can see the Access Violation when using the TdxBarManager component as I describe in the 2nd paragraph.
This does not happen in any of my other applications  --  I wonder if you could help pin down the problem; presumably it's somewhere in the 3 units included in the attached project?

Hi,
We have a Master/Details DXGrid.
ItemsSource  of the grid Control is DataTable
ColumnSource is a collection of model object ColumnInfo that contains properties including string property DisplayFormat
The Grid control uses  ColumnGeneratorTemplateSelector to generate columns
Column template defined as:
The problem is that Detail Grid Control doesn't respect DisplayFormat property  as you can see on the attached picture but it is working same time on  the Masters and other properties from ColumnInfo objects (like Caption) working properly on Master and Details.
Thank you for your help in advance.

Hi
I am trying to filter the scheduler in adgendview mode by a resource. I have found a similar support ticket (T532389) which appears to be the same query as mine. 
Can you supply the solution code for ASP.NET VB
Many thanks

Hi,
I want to navigate in my application (by a ViewModel Command)  when i click on a link or a button in AppointmentContentPanel. I started a DataTemplate but I really have no idea how to insert a button or a link. This one will have to trigger a viewModel command.
Since I did not succeed, I tried to trigger this command on the CustomAllowAppointmentEdit event. But that's not really what I wanted.
regards,
 

In my application, I have an option to automatically hide in the scheduler control any resources that aren't available during the displayed date(s), but they must be visible and unchecked in the ResourcesCheckedListBoxControl so they can be shown if an end-user want to.
First of all, when the form loads, the resources and appointments datatables are assigned to the SchedulerStorage corresponding datasources, with the required mappings to match the column names in the tables. So far so good, I can see all appointments for all resources.
Now I add the ResourcesCheckedListBoxControl in order to let end-users filter the resources manually. The datasource is set to the same table than my SchedulerStorage resources, again with the required mappings.When running the app, it looks exactly like what I'm expecting with my option, but as soon as I try to show a resources that was initially filtered out of the view, I run into an out of range exception.
I created a brand new project  with v17.2.5 components and get the exact same issue, I attached the project for you to review.
This test project will generate a dozen appointments and 4 resources.
You'll see when you execute that resources #1 and 2 are selected, #3 and 4 aren't. You can change the visibility of resources #1 and 2 easily with the ResourcesCheckedListBoxControl, but as soon as you try the same on resources #3 or 4, the exception is thrown.
Can you tell me what I need to do to avoid running into this problem?

Hi,
I have a report which has its datasource set to a dataset with the following structure:
DataSet
 - Table
 - Table 1
  - Table2
This dataset has been set from an xml file.
I have added a sub report to this report which I would like to pass a specific table from the dataset so I can databind to it  but I am unsure how to do so. I have tried setting the datasource of the sub report from the main report in the BeforePrint event:
Private Sub SubReport1_BeforePrint(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventArgs)
 CType(sender, XRSubreport).ReportSource.DataSource = Me.DataSource
 CType(sender, XRSubreport).ReportSource.DataMember = "Table1"
End Sub
However when I print preview the main report there is no data showing on the sub report, it looks like the correct number of rows are showing in the sub report but the rows are all blank. 
Do you have any suggestions?
Thanks in advance

Hi,
Finding that there was no French translation for the SchedulerControl componant, I used your localization tool to translate and downloaded the resulting archive (Attachment).
Although I see my translations in source folder, I cannot see my french translations for the SchedulerControl only. I unzipped this archive in bin\fr folder
 of my application and in bin\Debug folder of each wpf modules (configuration used).

Hi,
I think my problem statement is clear from the subject. I read few suggestions to solve this problem. Use autowidth and set MinWidth for each column,
But in my case, i am binding grid to datatable. I am not using gridcolumn and defining column names. Instead I am using autoGenerateColumn=AddNEW.
How can I achieve this considering in mind all these parameters.
Thank you 

When the ShowVerticalScrollBar property value is set to "true", an exception is thrown: The DXMainTable must contain row sections in the order header, body, and footer.
The same problem occurs with the ShowHorizontalScrollBar property. 
Using the new (non-obsolete) property in code-behind also  causes the same problem: Settings.VerticalScrollBarMode = ScrollBarMode.Visible;

Is there a solution where we can consume a REST /JSON as a datasource for a report and/or dashboard in the DevExpress Report Server?
Any guidance is greatly appreciated,

Hello,
Is there a way to access a dynamically created header template  control in column header (the columns are dynamically created as well) on client side. The header templates are created by Itemplate class on server side. Column is dynamically created and the header has checkbox control. Below is the code to create the template control.
 Friend Class MyCheckBoxTemplateHeader
    Implements ITemplate
    Public Sub InstantiateIn(ByVal container As Control) Implements ITemplate.InstantiateIn
        Dim chbox As New DevExpress.Web.ASPxCheckBox
        Dim gridContainer As DevExpress.Web.GridViewHeaderTemplateContainer = CType(container, DevExpress.Web.GridViewHeaderTemplateContainer)
        chbox.ID = gridContainer.Column.Name
        chbox.Text = gridContainer.Column.Name
        chbox.TextAlign = TextAlign.Left
        chbox.ClientInstanceName = "hdr" + gridContainer.Column.Name
        container.Controls.Add(chbox)
        chbox.ClientSideEvents.CheckedChanged = String.Format("function(s,e) {{ AllCheckColumn({0},s.GetChecked());}}", gridContainer.Column.Index)
        'chbox.AutoPostBack = False
        chbox.EnableViewState = False
        chbox.Font.Bold = True
    End Sub
End Class
I am trying to access the header checkbox control in client side to set checked value. Below is the client side coding. This same coding works for cell template of the column but not for header template. 
var columncount = GVSelectPartList.GetColumnCount();
 for (var c = 6; c < columncount; c++) {
            var col = GVSelectPartList.GetColumn(c);
            
            alert(col.name);
            var hboxname = 'hdr' + col.name;
            alert(hboxname);
            try {
                var hkbox = eval(hboxname);
                alert(hkbox);
                hkbox.SetChecked(false);
            }
            catch (e) {
                //alert('in continue');
                continue;
            }
        }
Any help is   appreciated.
Thank you

Hi DevExpress,
We are currently using DevExpress 17.2.4.0. One of our clients have found a bug in the DevExpress XtraGrid control related to Text Filters. I was able to replicate this problem using the DevExpress 17.2 XtraGrid Demo project. 
I've attached a video to demonstrate the issue.
Steps to Reproduce
===============
1. Open DevExpress 17.2 WinForms Demo project
2. Select "Data Grid and Editors" demo 
3. Select "GDI+ Mode" 
4. Select Grid Views => "Table View" from the left navigation panel
5. Right click "Product" column and choose "Filter Mode" => "Display Text"
6.  Click Filter icon

I have managed to successfully customize the popup form that is used to edit a row on a datagrid.  This form does show all the fields that are present in the grid, and that is all good.
The form allows the user to edit the properties of a Project  object, BUT I also need to show a grid at the bottom of the form which allows the user to edit the list of users that have access to that Project.  This "sub" datagrid will only allow adding and deleting in batch mode.
How can I add this datagrid and a label for it at the bottom of the edit popup form?

I'm trying to properly align two layout control items. Here is how it looks right now:
This is what I am trying to get to. I want the '+' properly centered in lblOrderExpandRow's height and I do NOT want the combo box to extend the length of the LayoutControlGroup:
How can I get it to operate like that?
 

Hi,
I'm looking for a bit of guidance.
I'm familiar with building client applications (WinForms c#) that connect direct to SQL but am struggling to understand how I can connect to the database through a web service such as oData or some kind of restful API.
I've been searching for over a month now with no luck. What I'm hoping is you would be able to explain the dev express tools I would need to use and perhaps provide a very basic demo that I can then pull apart to help understand the process and transition from directly connected applications.
I currently have a solution with 3 projects. 
Project 1 is the SQL database project, I have created a simple two table database with a relationship between the two tables (parent and child). 
Project 2 is a WinForms application (c#) with a single form. On the form is a field list of the two columns in the parent table of the database mentioned in project 1 and a data grid for table two.
Project 3 is supposed to be for some kind of web API service but that isn't going very well. I've been using the dev extreme WCF  oData template for this using the build from current database option (after I deployed project 1 to a test SQL server).
My intention was that I would be able to deploy project 3 to an IIS server in my DMZ and then run the client application from a remote location over the internet using the service address. Each time I try to add the service under the references node of the project solution tree I get an error but I'm fairly certain I've not actually made the correct service yet.
Much appreciated

Hi,
I know that it's possible to have an alternance for the style of detail data. Like the title says, I want to know if it's possible to have that same pattern but for my detail grouped.
Ex.:
1$-10$
White row
White row
White row
11$-20$
Grey row
Grey row
21$-30$
White row
White row
... 
Thank you,
David 

We have a GridControl that allows for filtering via the DataControlBase.FixedFilter (from higher-level filters in the Model) and DataControlBase.FilterCriteria (for user-level filters).  We have a scenario where another control needs to aggregate counts for specific fields based on the same IEnumerable<T> collection the GridControl is pointed at.  But the aggregation needs to include the FilterCriteria (not the fixed filter).
We have read about  CriteriaToWhereClauseHelper on various support tickets but have concerns.  According to the very last response in this post:
it is a defunct class.  This would seem to be corroborated by the fact that we can
 find it in the online documentation:
My question is how can we take the filter in FilterCriteria and apply it to the IEnumerable?  We do not want to rely on a class that is not maintained or guaranteed to work in all cases, obviously.
Currently, we create an internal, non-rendered grid to provide the engine but this is obviously less then ideal. Ideally, we would like to have direct access to the filtering engine that the grid control is using - this way we are (reasonably) certain the end result will match the visible grid. Is that possible?  
Thanks

Hi 
I have a custom WinForms HTML property editor which is used in several Detail Views.
A lot of my forms are made ReadOnly under certain circumstances using an Appearance Attribue
As you can see from the above TargetItems, I want to disable all controls except Status.  This approach works great for all DevExpress controls, but not on the custom property editor which needs to have its Enabled property set to false.  Is there any way of making this custom property editor respond to the above Appearance Attribute or is there some other way this can be disabled from a view controller or business object? 

I've created a Bubble Chart with the appropriate X, Y, and weighted values. The chart shows the bubbleserieslabel for the weighted value.  The code is below.
Is it possible to have the label show another value, such as the organization name; or in some other way designate the organization name on the chart? The organization name is not the X, Y, or weighted value.
The organization name is necessary for the chart to have much meaning. Thanks,

I have a document templating system that I have developed using the docvariables in the richedit. My users create a template for their documents, on to which they drag data type descriptors which my application converts to doc variables in the template
When the user creates correspondence using the template, the calculatedocvariables event is used to replace the fields with the data the user has connected to the field. This all works as expected.
I have a situation where I want to provide the ability to provide a table for multiple related records - lets say the document is called Order Notification and has a template something like;
When the docvariable is calculated, I want the items table to populate for every related item. At the moment I just do this by getting the independent variables and separating them with a carriage return, but this has real formatting issues.
I am aware of the nested merge functionality (per 
) but I want to make it invisible to the user - maybe a method of extracting any tables that contain fields programatically into a separate document prior calculating the docvariables or something might work?
Is there a way to do this? Is there someway to hijack a nested merge which is invisible to the user or something similar? Keep in mind that the layout of the table and which fields are in it must remain customizable to the user when creating the template.

Hi,
I have a customer HTML property editor which works well in the eXpressApp Framework except the object needs to be saved even when no changes have been made.  This happens whenever the form is closed or you move on to the next / previous record - see screen clip.
Here is the code for the editor:
The ValueChanged event does not fire unless you actually type something into the control, but something is happening behind the scenes which seems to be making the object modified and require saving.  I have checked the HTML tags and nothing is changing in the HTMLBodyText.
I have emailed the control developers for help and they say it is a standard Windows .Net control and although it should work fine in any Windows Forms App and although they haven't tried it in an eXpressApp framework they are not aware of any similar issues being reported.  I realise this is not a DevExpress issue but was wandering if the eXpressApp framework itself  calls any particular events which may cause this issue when closing or validating an object for instance?

When setting the Properties.ReadOnly property of a RadioGroup control (Winforms), I like the current font color look of the radio buttons, as if they are not disabled.  However, when hovering over the radio button, the circle color becomes filled in as if the user has the option to select it and change the value.
My question is - how do we disable the color change of the radio button (in a radio group control that is set to readonly) when the mouse is hovered over?  
I know that we can use the skin to set the hover color, but there is only an option to set the hover color that applies to the control whether the it's read only or not (no specific hover color for readonly).  Also, I know that disabling the radio button disables the hover color from changing, but I do not like the light (disabled) appearance of the radio button text and circle and there is no AppearanceReadOnly.BackColor  property that can be set for either the radio button or radio group.
Thanks,
Eric

Hello,
I've been attempting to  force controls (LayoutControlItem) within a LayoutGroup within a LayoutPanel to resize as the panel is resized.
No matter what widths = auto or horizontalalignment = stretch properties I give the various controls, adding a longer string to a TestItem control always forces the LayoutGroup to have a horizontal scrollbar as opposed to truncating the contents of the textbox or doing a text wrap.
I've also tried setting all of the ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll = "False". Didn't make a difference.
What am I missing? Everything up the XAML tree is set to auto width and horizontal stretch.
See attached picture for result.
Thanks!

I am trying to find a way to use the Report Designer against a larger data base (~10 million records) when I have a separated data access layer.  I have tried using an ObjectDataSource, but that doesn't seem to pass the filter back to the database even when I give it an IQueryable (I have a controller method that returns the IQueryable, and the ObjectDataSource's data source and data member point to that method).  I have also looked at the EFDataSource control, but because our data access layer encapsulates the EF access, all I get back is an IQueryable.  The GridView control seems to work fine with the LinqServerModeDataSource, but I can't seem to find something comparable that works for reports.  I looked at the SqlQuery approach, but that seems to rely on being able to hard-code parameters into the reports to match parameters in the query, which can't really be expected when end-users are using the Report Designer to build their own reports and giving their parameters custom names.
Is there something I'm missing, or how should reporting against large datasets with client-accessible designers be done?   I'd like to be able to just take the filter expression on the report, apply it against the IQueryable somehow, and then set that as the data used by the report, but I don't seem to be able to find a good way to map a filter expression onto an IQueryable.  The LinqServerModeDataSource obviously does it, but I don't know if that ability is exposed anywhere that I can take advantage of.

I have some report code that was running fine prior to upgrading to 17.2 and now I am having some trouble.  The issue I have is strange as I don't have a problem on my development PC, but when I install my software on a non-development PC and try to print a report I get the following error 
"The following error occurred when the script in the procedure XrTableCell115.BeforePrint was executed: 
There are following errors in scripts(s) :
line 1, column 1: error CS1056: Entered code is not correct"
Because the error doesn't occur on my development PC  I am having a difficult time troubleshooting it.  I have attached a call stack from my error reporting software for you to reference.
Please help, many thanks in advance.

Hi,
 We have had a few of our end-users get an error "Access violation at address 0C660A95 in module 'dxPSCoreRS22.bpl'. Read of address 00000000" (address varies) when opening a form that contains a TdxComponentPrinter, with a CurrentLink of a TdxCustomContainerReportLink (its Component property is set to print the entire form, and it's a fairly complex form with dock panels etc).
The issue is exceedingly rare - we've had only 4 reports of it so far out of hundreds of customers. We certainly have not been able to reproduce it ourselves.
It seems to happen after upgrading the software from a version that used DevExpress  VCL 16.1.2 to 17.1.5 (it's also possible the affected machines may have run earlier versions of DevExpress VCL in the past). So far it has only affected one user per customer - other users at the same customer running the same copy of the software from a shared network drive have no problem, but one user on one machine has the problem.
I suspect it's something to do with the user's Windows profile. One customer was able to resolve the problem by restoring the user's Windows profile from an earlier backup. Another resolved the issue by replacing the user's hard drive (they were doing this anyway to upgrade the user's machine to Windows 10).
I know it's not much to go on, but can you provide any information that might shed some light on this issue? Does ExpressPrinting store or use anything in the user's Windows  profile, or something else that is specific to the user/machine, that might cause this error? Could it have anything to do with the printers that the user has access to in Windows?

This issue is related to T600913.  After getting the Link and Unlink actions working it became apparent that the DataSourceProperty for the Skills collection in the master object was not being respected.  The lookup list displayed by the Link action was not applying the expected criteria to limit the list of choices.
In the sample program (attached) skills can be associated with employment records via a many-to-many relationship.  A DataSourceProperty attribute is defined to limit the choices to those skills owned by the employer. This is to prevent skills from IBM's catalog to be assigned to a Microsoft employee (and vice versa).  The filtering works as expected when the Link action is invoked from the nested list view. 
However, no filtering occurs when the Link action is invoked as follows.  As a result the user could easily link skills from the wrong employer.

Hi, recently I began to use XPO as my ORM Tool in a new XAF application instead of EntityFramework, but when I create an XPO Object in the Model.xpo, and add a field with the IsNullable property set to False the generated field in the SQL Server Database allows null values, which is wrong.
If I run the app I can save objects in the Database with null values, the IsNullable property has not effect.
I have checked the database and I see the fields accepting NULL. The Database was generated using XPO. 
I have attached an image showing this behavior.
I have read some threads in the forum like this:
And this too:
So, which is the purpose of the IsNullable property in the XPO ORM Designer if the generated database dont reflect this (IsNullable = false)
? 

We have a WPF application that is built against v16.1.6 of the DevExpress Components..
In our application user selections often show a property grid with the values for the selected item.
The following behaviour has been observed;
- Windows desktop scaling is set to 125% 
- User selects an item that has more properties than the property grid can display, so the vertical scroll bars appear
- user hovers  over the property grid and uses the mouse wheel to scroll the grid
- The UI completely freezes - no visual updates, and not responding to user input - and looking in the task manager the program is using almost 100% of a single CPU core.
Recreating the issue in a debugging session i was able to observe that pausing the 'frozen'  application, shows that the main thread seems to be endlessly looping through a render or layout cycle.
Also, although this issue was originally observed running on a number of Windows 10 systems, I was also able to create the issue in Windows 7 (64-bit)
The effect can be demonstrated in the WPF demos app that came with the components install.
- Open the WPF PropertyGrid demo
- Select the "Category Attributes" example
- make the window less tall so that the grid needs to be scrolled to see all of the content
- hover over the grid and scroll up and down with the mouse wheel.
All assistance in resolving this would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

HI,
I was wondering, if i use the your spread sheet item. Does the end user have to have office with excel installed for it to work. Or is it independent. It will work if the end user does not have a office installed.

I am currently using this datagrid as a drill through chart. I would like to display what filter is being applied and let the user clear that filter if they would like. 
I am calling the filter with this code 
But it is currently applying the filter and won't display that to the user. It also removes other data that isn't included in the filter. 
How can I make it behave the same as if the user were to type a filter in the filter row? 

I am using this to save Ribbon.Toolbar layout to a user setting.  When I right click on items and say add to Quick Access Toolbar and save, some of the items switch to a different item when layout is reloaded.
Save Code:
    Public Sub SaveRibbonQat(ribbon As DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonControl, userSetting As String)
        Dim ms As New IO.MemoryStream
        ribbon.Toolbar.SaveLayoutToStream(ms)
        Dim sr As IO.StreamReader = New IO.StreamReader(ms)
        ms.Seek(0, IO.SeekOrigin.Begin)
        Dim layoutQat As String = sr.ReadToEnd
        DR_User(userSetting) = layoutQat
        TA_User.Update(DT_User)
    End Sub
Load Code
    Dim Layout As String = ""
        Dim cTmp As String = IO.Path.GetTempFileName
        Dim output As New IO.StreamWriter(cTmp)
        Layout = DR_User("SeiUserCmoRibbonQat")
        output.Write(Layout)
        output.Close()
        'RibbonControl.Toolbar.RestoreLayoutFromXml(cTmp)
        Dim str As System.IO.Stream = New MemoryStream(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(Layout))
        RibbonControl.Toolbar.RestoreLayoutFromStream(str)

I have a general question regarding using the: RowCellStyle(object sender, DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.RowCellStyleEventArgs e)
vs. using format rules.
I started to notice some funky behavior using RowCellStyle and when I switched to the format rules, it seemed to clear it up.
Is there a best-practice to follow or a guideline on which to use and when?
Thanks in advance,

Hello,
I tried a little poc for a future big app, with devextreme and angular.  I need to create a full page app (spa) and I tried two poc, contained in the devextreme_apps.zip file.
- The ffsa-pocs presents a simple grid with some fixed zones, and flexbox is used with bootstrap classes.  Il you try it, the columns are more larger than the screen and there is NO horizontal scrollbar, but the grid  goes beyong the right side. If you change the columns defs with these in comment (with widths in percentage), all is all right. Are my classes missused?
- The ffsa-liste-lics use a similar case, with a grid and a toolbar at the top. Flexbox is used by the angular/flex-layout angular module.  All seems to work correctly, but... if I resize the Navigator, the grid adjusts correctly if I grows the Chrome window, but a scrollbar appears if I try to shrink the Chrome window! Same question : missuse of me or problem? And in contrary with the first sample, horizontal scrollbar works correctly!
Thanks in advance,
Bruno
 

Hi,
I am dynamically generating Document panels as tabs using MVVM.
I have derived a custom control from DocumentPanel and have added some custom properties to it.  
public class DynamicDocumentPanel : DocumentPanel
    {
        static DynamicDocumentPanel()
        {
        }
    }
And then added default style to it using resource:  
 <Style TargetType="{x:Type controls:DynamicDocumentPanel}" BasedOn="{StaticResource {themes:DefaultStyleThemeKey FullName=DevExpress.Xpf.Docking.DocumentPanel}}" >
        <Setter Property="Caption" Value="{Binding Caption}" />
        <Setter Property="ShowCloseButton" Value="False" />
        <Setter Property="IsActive" Value="{Binding IsActive}" />
        <Setter Property="ClosingBehavior" Value="ImmediatelyRemove" />
        <Setter Property="CloseCommand" Value="{Binding CloseTickerSnapCommand}"/>
        <Setter Property="IsTabStop" Value="True"></Setter>
    </Style>
Now my question how can I apply this custom DocumentPanel to the document group , so that instead of a list of document panels I get my list of 
custom document panels.
Thanks,

Hello
1. I am using HTML5 Document Viewer.

3. What I want to do is to select the second parameter and change the third parameter list. I do not know how.
 

I have a project that uses a Word add in. When I open up a WPF dialog and try to open my Popup Color Editor dropdown, nothing seems to happen. When I debug the issue, it seems fine. However, when I run the debug and open the deployed add in, instead of nothing happen, I seem to be hitting this error: 
 Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.
************** Exception Text **************
System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
This seems like some sort of Referencing issue, but It seems impossible to pin down because the debugging build seems to be fine.
I noticed that the references cannot be loaded in the project properties reference page.
The devexpress add ins I am using are:

We just converted our OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDIalog calls to use the new XtraOpenFileDialog and XtraSaveFileDialog.  We've noticed that the Breadcrumb address bar doesn't work right when viewing a folder on a mapped network drive.  If you click one of the folders in the middle of the path, the address does not change to that folder.  For example, if the current path is I:\Folder1\Folder2\Folder2\Folder4, then clicking on Folder 2 should switch to I:\Folder1\Folder2,  but it doesn't do anything.  The drop down menus for each folder segment work ok.
If we do the same test on folders on the C:\ drive, they work fine.

I am trying to determine when a click on DevExpress Scheduler Appointment is a Single Click or Double Click.
With a single click, I create a New Appointment...
With a Double Click, I populate the Headers.
My problem is, when I double click, it goes through the code for single and double click taking a long time.
I want to go through MouseClick event when there is one click and MouseDoubleClick event when I double click.
I would appreciate if you can send me some code sample.
Thanks. 

I have a callback that is getting executed after the session expires.  I need to know what I can do in a callback.  Redirect is not allowed in a callback and the issue is the grid control is always null.  The callbacks keep working but many of the controls on the page are null.  How can I handle the callback and redirect when the session has expired?

Hi in my server side code in C# I create an instance of a devexpress xtrreport and then call the print method
ie
now when I test this on my local desktop pc it prints to my default printer.
but when I try from our live website it displays a error that no default printer is installed.I have a default printer installed on the web server too.
I know this is not exactly a devexpress error but any help is appreciated. 

The typings for dxScheduler seem somewhat sparse.  I know it may not be considered part of the public api, but there is multiple support tickets on the dxScheduler that mention using getWorkSpace via javascript.  Unfortunately, getWorkSpace is not part of the typings file so it has to be manually added to prevent typescript errors. 
There also seems to be quite a few other methods/functions that exist in the js file, but aren't found in the typings.   Would it be possible to get the typings updated with more things specifically for the dxScheduler?

Hi Guys,
Just wish to advise that SVG icons don't work correctly  in Layout Groups and Ribbons, they get cut off and create edges. I've attached a screenshot to demonstrate this, the 'Help' button is the issue. I've resolved this issue by changing it back to PNG images and all ok now.

Hi,
I was wondering if there is a way to have a master detail  display in a dxTreeList? Or a way to simulate it? Similar to opening the edit form in a row.
Thanks

I have an application that is using the plugin cordova-sqlite-plugin. Unfortunately, this is a rather lighter weight version of SQL. The version of the plugin cordova-sqlite-storage referenced at the URL above fails to build an application template as Don mentions.

Hi,
Our dashboards are running of Sqlite database files. Since we upgraded to 17.2.3 (from 16.2) we have started getting intermittent error from Dashboard viewer that the  sql query is unable to be executed as table could not be found, and displays data load errors in the dashboard items. The problem goes away if the user switches to dashboard design mode and returns to viewer without making any changes.
We found that if the IIS server is restarted the problem goes away as well.
This issue is intermittent so I think there is some caching issue data service for the dashboards. I have attached the error stack when this issue occurs.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

Hi, I have discovered a strange behavior in DockLayoutManager. I have attached a sample project to demonstrate that. Just run the app and you will see DockManager with some LayoutGroups. Group named "Clipped" will be cliipped. This is not correct I think. But moreover, if you increase height of main window, relayouting will occur, although the height of DockLayoutManager itself will not change.
Thanks for help.

Hi,
I am using filter control in standalone mode. I need to make the column collections to be case insensitive.
I created one datacolumn collection in datatable with columnames and types
I bind the datacolumn collection (datatable) to filter control's source control.
When I make changes in filter field , then the operator dropdown becomes invalid.
e.g.
Filterfield : LOANMASTER|FIELD
DataColumn field : LoanMaster|Field , Type- String.
In above cases , I need the operator dropdown to be visible in all cases whether the field names are in upper/lower/camel cased.
Can you please help me in this
Thanks

Hi, I attached the simple app to demonstrate this behavior. Just run the app and you will see clipped edit associated with the last LayoutControlItem.

Hello,
I'm working on an GridControl with an GridView running in ServerMode per 
.
As described in the 
-Article, I tried to retreive the Value with the OperationCompleted-delegate, but it doesn't get called.
Is there any Way to retreive the visible Rows Keys that doesn't need to load the full Objects from the Queryable-Source?
My current (not working) Code is the following: 
I've another piece of code that iterates the Grid-Handles and forces the Grid to load the Objects. But I can't use this since it's too slow and needs to load the whole Objects anyway.
I made it to get the visible Entity Ids by using the DevExpress internal classes.
1. Can I get the IDs without additional queries? 
    I think the current way how I obtained the ids isn't very good, since the LinqServerModeCore runs multiple queries    
2. Can I get the IDs with applying the GridView's Column-Sortings?
    Since the user will use the IDs in the order like displayed in the grid, it's required to get them as display.
Thank you in advance for your efford.
Now I made it to get the IDs in the correct Order, depending on the current Filters and Sortings made in the GridView.
I get the IDs in the correct Order with applied Filtering. Everything behaves same as the GridView. 
I'm stuck at applying the GridViews groupings to my IQueryable-Source.
:
I've tried to merge several OperandProperties with CriteriaOperator.And() but it gives me an Exception while converting it to an Expression.
Thank you in advance for your efford.

HI
i have a TimeEdit with an input mask of HHmm. the display mask is HH:mm.
to enter a full time, need to do, for example, 07<left arrow key>30.  entering 0730 will result in 3000.  (the 3rd and fourth character overwrites the original first two). 
is there a way to do it so if we enter 0730 then it will process it as 07:30?
 

Hi
I have started the update of the DevExpress components to ver. 17.2.5
My PC is a powerful one with a 4.2 Ghz CPU, 32 GB RAM and SSD discs 
It have run for more than an hour now... that is way to long, since I cannot start to work before this is done.
The other updates of the documentation, coderush etc. runs fast, no problem here.
But you really need to optimize the install/update of the components.
Thanks

 I am able to change color of dxnav:TileBar  itself but not child element (See sample project).
We are not using theme designer and we are not planing to  introduce it. Please, provide solution winch can override a default color of that particular control or if there is no way of doing that. Please, provide a way to override a default color of the theme.

hi support team,
I'm applying the dxFilterBuilder control to my MVC project.
It worked perfect until I got the trouble when getting its filter string.
It looks like this:  ["CustomerID", "contains", "DEF"],
["WarehouseID", "contains", "ABC"]
How could I parse this condition string so that SQL can understand?
Please advise.
Thanks.
 

Dear Madam/Sir,
At the moment we are upgrading our scheduler to the latest version v17.2 (
). The scheduler is using jQuery v1.11. Beside the scheduler we also use other controlers of this suite. But in due course we have to upgrade to a higher version of jQuery (v2.x). 
1. What are your thoughts regarding upgrading this suite of controls to a another version of jQuery v2.x? 
2. jQuery v2.x is not backwards compatible with v1.x. Assume a new version of the scheduler uses jQuery v2.x, could we easily upgrade to this version if we keep our scheduler up-to-date?
Looking forward to you answer. Many thanks in advance,

Dear support.
I would like to suggest that you include the Microsoft Terminology Service API as a third source.
They provide an API to automatically translate strings into other languages.
I already used a few strings to make some progress in the German translation of your components.
This is a very good and already validated source.

Dear Devexpress Team,
I have a serious Problem with one of  my Projects.
To demonstrate the behaviour, I have created a small Demo. See attachment. 
Pleas change the Connectionstring to the AdventureWorks DB to run the Demo.
The Grid loads a list of Documents.
When you click the rows, Clientside FocusedRowChanged is fired. 
For convenience, on each FocusedRowChanged an alert is triggered.
The Button below the Grid changes alternating row 1 so the record does not  fit or fit the Grid's filter condition.
Hence the record is not shown after a Refresh.
Problem:
The Grid's Focus is now on a different row, but FocusedRowChanged  is NOT fired.
Can you please Review this Situation?
Thank you very much.

I'd like to be able to specify custom icons to use through out my project.
i.e. Cut, Copy, Paste etc found in context menus and message box icons
I have found examples of doing this for controls and message boxes I create but I need to effect all controls and message boxes including the ones create by your controls.
Example
Spell checked shows a "Spell checking complete" with the incorrect (for my project) information icon.
XtraSaveFileDialog also show message boxes with icons I need to change, I also notice this shows a wait form which is not my customized wait form.
I can imagine this being a lot of work but if we cannot currently do this we cannot use any of the code to customize icons because we introduce an unacceptable inconstancy.

See attached sample.
Structure is:
Project
- Contract
-- Line
In the GroupHeader at Contract level, how do I show the Project's Name? I tried [^.Name], but that doesn't seem to work.

Hi, I am using MVC bar chart. To display data within the Series label I used the property   t.Label.TextPattern = "{A}  {V} ";. By using this the data is being populated.

I have a pivotGrid and GridControl set up with a date field...
Both have a RepositoryItem that has a NullValue of 01/01/0001 and a NullText of Opening Balance.
This displays correctly in the Grid. However when I Export, the Excel file shows

Hello,
I was wondering, is it expected behaviour that an editable gridview  (OptionsBehavior.Editable = true)  doesn't allow its items to be dragged? 
I have a few non-editable columns (OptionsColumn.AllowEdit = false), that I thought should be suitable for dragging using the BehaviorManager component (as in 
).
How do I do this? 

Hello,
We've been trying to select a row in a gridView through client side events, which seems to be working fine, unless the the row resides on a different page. We want the grid to navigate to the page that holds the selected row.
We're currently calling the 
' method  
We've ran into this problem before when we wanted'' to select (and navigate to) a new record that was added . And we've managed to fix this in a server side event by calling '
', but there does not seem to be a method like that on clientside.
Is there any way to navigate to a page that holds a certain key value on client-side ?
Or a server-side event  that triggers on selection changed?
Or do we have to iterate through every possible page and check whether the key value exists on said page?

Hello,
I could not find any articles related to my request. I have filled my xtragrid with data from my database and added a check box so that the user can select rows he wants to export.
now i would like to import the selected rows into a spreadsheet. Up to now I used the import functionality of the workbook for a datatable. Is it possible to import the data from a xtragrid directly?

Attached you can find a demo project that i've made to demonstrate the problem, if you press the "draw RightAngle" button, ConnectorPointRestrictions are respected but connectors are easily overlapping. If instead you press "draw Curved" button, ConnectorPointRestrictions are not respected.
In this sample you can also notice why i was asking for adding empty space between the diagram and first shape, as you can see when you use RightAngle, connectors are drawed outside of the diagram grid.
My perfect solution is to have RightAngle connectors that do not overlap, more space between shapes and space from diagram borders and first shape, but i can give a try to curved connectors if i'm able to make them respect ConnectorPointRestrictions.

I need to use the custom dropdown button in ComboBoxEditSettings to display dropdown list in GridColumn, binding the OpenPopupCommand don't work, the dropdown can't open. please advise.

Hi there,
we've recently noticed that with DevExpress 17.1.6 our CustomDrawAppointmentBackground event handler doen't work as expected anymore. We've developed the code with DevExpress 9.3 and unfortunately I cannot say when it stopped working.
The objective of the code is,  to draw a custom Image background for DayViewTimeCells in our custom scheduler report. When running with DevExpress 17.1.6 our custom background image is drawn, but the cell text is no longer displayed. It seems like our custom image is now no longer drawn behind the text as a background image but in front of the text, thus painting it over. 
Our code looks like this:
            if (image != null)
            {
                e.DrawDefault();
                try
                {
                    e.Cache.Paint.DrawImage(e.Cache.Graphics, image, location);                    
                }
                catch { } // GDI-Fehler ignorieren
                e.Handled = true;
            }
Your documentation says in the CustomDrawAppointmentBackground topic:
Note
Use the CustomDrawObjectEventArgs.Cache property to paint shapes, write a text and insert images. Do not use the CustomDrawObjectEventArgs.Graphics object in Scheduler Reports.
I believe we should not be using e.Cache.Graphics when calling DrawImage, but what else do we need to to to "insert an image"?
Thanks in advance.

Hi,
I am trying to arrange some dxbuttons in a view by using dxResponsiveBox. This works as long as I don't try to use event handlers.
But as soon as i use an event handler, it get an error claiming that the event handler is not defined.
This is my .dxview file:
This is my .js file:
If I take the button out of the ResponsiveBox, everything works.
 What am I doing wrong here? 

Hi!
We would like to use FilterControl to create filter criteria for a sort of our own internal dataset (logically, it can be represented as a data table with columns and rows) and apply the criteria to the dataset's row (predicate function would be great). No GridControl or any other UI for the dataset should be involved at this stage.
Moreover, we want these criteria to be saved (serialized to text?) and then can be loaded and applied to our dataset with no UI at all (even no FilterControl created).
Is it possible to do this?
Could you please provide a general guidance what to start from? (class names?) 
 


Hello. 
1. When you try to move the rectangle, which describes the value of a formula occurs Access Violation.

Hi DevExpress,
I was going to write that due to missing SelectionChanged event in new scheduler it would be very useful to have SchedulerControl.SelectedInterval as a dependency property, but I just found that it already is. However, you don't mention that in your documentation nor it is mentioned in the tooltip hint in the Visual Studio. In other dependency properties it is explicitly mentioned, so I suppose you just forgot to update the docs.
Just a minor thing, but it might help others to immediately see whether they can use binding or not ;)
Kind regards
Peter

ResourceNavigation.NavigateBackward();
ResourceNavigation.NavigateFirst();
ResourceNavigation.NavigatePageBackward();
No success,
also i have a problem when i try to drag an appointment outside the visible zone, i don't know if it's related.
is there another approach to this, or a parameter that i should activate deactivate ?

Hello,
I'm trying to have my apps behave correctly in High DPI (or rather in scaled mode) and have their size/position saved/restored when closed/opened.
 I am attaching a simple project that shows the problem : click on the open button, position and size the window, close it and re-click on "open" : position and size will change (grow) on scaled monitors. It works correctly on unscaled monitors.
And if you change TForm2's ancestor from TdxRibbonForm back to TForm, sizes and positions are working as expected.
What am I doing wrong ?
Thanks,

Good morning, 
I am developing my application using XAF and in the web application I created a custom view to represent the data contained inside of an XML document. I can display the node attributes without any problem by adding a TreeListTextColumn with the FieldName = attribute name. I wanted to know if it was possible to add a column that displayed the tag name of the node, for example:
the treelist would show:
- dvs 
 347
    - vrb 
355
        - idf 
 355
    - pgh 
 367
        - pgh 
 1337
          - pgh 
 1350

Hi,
Mostly in Terminal Enviroments i'm facing the issue that the Column Chooser is not poping up Top Most but hiding behind the Application. What can be done to avoid that? 
Regards Wolfram

Hi,
We are working on a large XAF web project. Some time ago we migrated from XAF 16.2.6 to 17.2.3 and are getting a particular problem with the detail view heading i.e. the default property of the object currently in view. When we navigate to next or previous object the heading does not change ,the first time,even though the data in detail view has changed. The change only happen  on the second click which means the heading does not belong to the data in view. This is causing us major issues when users are using navigation actions and it was working perfectly fine in the previous version. Nothing has changed since the upgrade related to navigation or view refreshing.
This issue is only happening in this project and when we created another project to check the issue wasn't there so we will not be able to provide a sample project. Is there anything else we can provide or check to resolve this issue or can you think of any reason by the description mentioned above?
Any help will be appreciated.
Thank you 

Dear Support,
I have an application witch is using AspxRichEdit in order to edit docx and html files.
There is a problem with some documents when trying to open them. The editor does not render them entirely or is not render them at all in some cases.
I will give you 4 file examples:
 - "doc1_v1_loadsWithoutFirst2pages.docx"
the editor don't load the first 2 pages.
 - "doc1_v2_modified_loads all pages.docx"
is almost the same document as previous, but i removed some text from bullet "4."
this document shows all pages. I tried in many ways to find the cause of this. Even changed the extension from ".docx" to ".zip" and compared the XMLs. I couldn't find nothig special that could cause this behabiour.
 - "doc2_first2pages.docx" 
loads only the first 2 pages out of 24
 - "doc3_notLoadingAnything.docx"
not loading anything. Stays on "Loading..." forever
We also have problems with other documents. For some only the first 4 or 5 pages are renderd. We didn't find a pattern.
If I open one problematic document and save it back to disk, the editor saves the hole content in the new file. 
So the content exist in the editor's internal structure but for some reasons it doesn't render all the content in page.
I also made a sample with an empty WebForms Project that contains an AspxRichEdit editor.
Thank you an I look forward for a solution,
Robert

Hello,
I have a chart control with a line series 2D that is bound to a list of objects containing a double value property for the y-axis and a datetime  property for the x-axis. It is possible that this list contains two objects with the same datetime but a different value. I have to show both of these items in the chart but the chart control calculates the average of those items and displays the resulting value.
How can I get the diagram to show all of the values?

Hi
I have a  dxg:TreeListView located inside a dxlc:GroupBox. 
The group box, is located inside a dxlc:DockLayoutControl together with another group box.
This tree list view has several columns, however only one of the columns is visible.
The group box has the property dxlc:DockLayoutControl.AllowHorizontalSizing="True". This allows horizontal resizing of the two group boxes.
I would like to have the width of the single visible column changed according to the current width of the groupbox; however, when horizontally resizing the group box containing the tree, the width of the column doesn't change. 
I tried setting the AutoWidth property of the TreeListView to true, however this causes the width of the entire groupbox to actually be the total size of the dock control, overriding the second group box.
Adding Width="*" to the definition of the single visible column also causes the same.
What would be the right way to define the width of the single visible column to be automatically resized to the width of the containing object which is the group box?
Thanks.

I'd like to create a shortcut to repeat the last run tests.
I can create a shortcut but it doesn't seem to run the command. Clearly I'm doing something wrong - but not sure what....
In Options/IDE/Shortcuts/UnitTesting I added a new shortcut for Ctrl+T, L and selected the RepeatLastTests command, applied and then tried to invoke it, instead of running the last run tests the row the cursor was on was deleted.
Then I changed it to Sync the shortcut with the command key binding  registered in Visual Studio, applied the change and again tried to invoke it, but again the current row was deleted. 
What do I need to do in order to be able to invoke the RepeatLastTests from the keyboard?

Hello,
I'm using the 'calculateCustomSummary' function to create a custom column in my pivotGrid  like this:
I'm trying to set an link into the 'cell.text' of my fields, letting the 'cell.value' with value from 'Value' column. Is there a way that i can manipulate the text and the value separately in the customSummary, so i can show the correct value in the fields and open the link only on click? 
I'm expecting to build my links with somenthing like this:
Or, if possible, create the link right in the summaryProcess.

HI DX Team,
I'm trying to show a spinner (loading indicator) on switching tab. 
DXTabControl Xaml:
Starting an indicator is a piece of cake - I'm setting IsLoading to true in setter of SelectedTabIndex property, but hiding it makes me a headache, I cannot find any suitable event to hide it when tab is actually shown.
The main delay is generated by the sluggish controls loading reported under 
 ticket, so setting IsLoading to false just after loading data makes the indicator appear for the split second and then we have a 2-3 seconds delay without any indication.
Can you give me some advice how can I do it property?
Best Regards,
Kamil

I fill a read-only TcxTextEdit with a string that is larger then the window:
TextEditDeclaratieBedrag.Visible   := True;
TextEditDeclaratieBedrag.EditValue := lText;   
TextEditDeclaratieBedrag.Hint      := lHint;
After this the 'cursor' in the TcxTextEdit is positioned behind the text, so that I only see the tail part.
Example: When lText is 'USD 10,00 + Voorschot: USD 30,00', what I see is ' + Voorschot: USD 30,00'
How can I 'position' the captionso that I see the start of the string, e.g. 'USD 10,00 + Voorsc'?
(When I click the control, it updates correctly).
I tried:
- SetFocus (error 'Cannot focus an invisible window')
- CursorPos (error 'Cannot assign a read-only property')
- SelLength/SelStart (no effect, despite 
. I even tried toggling Properties.ReadOnly around this)
- SelectAll (no effect)
- setting EditingText instead of EditValue (no effect)
- ClearSelection (no effect)
- SetSelection(0,0) (no effect)

Hi,
I'm using Doughnut charts to show my information, and I added a Total in the midle using a div and css. 
However, I have my legend in the bottom, and if it has a lot of items, the css palces it out of place.
I attached a printscreen exemplifying this.
Is there any way the cart can display this center total information on its own? Similiar to this exemple in the stacked bars:

Hi,
I've got the following scenario I'm trying to solve and having some issues so wanted to see what you'd recommend.
I need an action that enables a user to merge multiple records into one (for de-duplication of Products, Contacts, etc).  However, rather tha n doing a "dumb" merge we want to allow the user to do a "smart" merge where the user is able to choose what properties come from what record as some information may be current or better on one record and other information may be current or better on another record.
This presents a few problems.
1. The user needs to be able to select which property comes from which record.  This also doesn't need to occur for all public properties, but only those that make sense to be manually selected (not Created Date for example where the earliest date should be taken always).  We don't want to add non-persistent fields to the persistent objects for this purpose only though.  So the logical solution is to create a non-persistent object with Use[Property] fields for each property we want the decision to be made on manually and somehow populate this.
To solve this first problem we created a custom CollectionSource that just returns an empty list and then the CollectionSource.Collection is manually populated in an event.  Using a custom CollecionSource is necessary to show a list of Non-Persistent objects in the popup view.
Is this the right approach or should we be doing it differently?
2. We want to allow the user to use the FilterEditor to essentially query in the popup view and also to preset the filter criteria when the popup view opens.
To solve pre-setting of criteria we created the controller in the Win module and  set the ActiveFilterString of the GridView in the ControlsCreated event.  This worked fine.  Now as the view is based on Non-Persistent objects we added an event handler for the ColumnFilterChanged event of the GridView and in it we grab the gridView's ActiveFilterString and use to GetObjects to retrieve the persistent objects and manually clear and re-populate the collection. This works fine.
Is this the right approach or should we be doing it differently?
The other question we have is how do we stop the Use[Property] properties from being used for filtering in AutoFilterRow OR FilterEditor?  We found 
 but couldn't get the solution fully working for Win.
3. We want to prevent double-clicking on a record in the list view in the popup window from closing the popup window.
We managed to solve this by disabling the ProcessCurrentObjectAction in the FrameAssigned event.
4.  When clicking OK in the popup the popup window should close without further dialogs being shown.  However, in this case, because the user effectively modifies the non-persistent objects in the popup by ticking the Use[Property] properties we get a dialog asking if we want to close without saving when the OK button is clicked.  We tried setting e.DialogController.SaveOnAccept to both true and false but neither works to stop this.
Can you please suggest how to disable the warning coming up when the popup is closed.
Obviously we'll need to be able to access the non-persistent objects in the Execute event handler so we can loop through them.
5. We only want to allow a single Use[Property] to be ticked across all objects shown in the popup so the user can only choose for the data for a particular property to come from one of the records.
Do we have to handle some event in the grid and essentially set Use[Property] to false for all other objects in the collection that's used for the grid data source?  Can you please suggest how this is best achieved. 
Here is the code we have so far to do all this:
 

After upgrading from 15.2 to 17.2 version of Devexpress Grid, column with currency / number format fields values of 0 / 0.00 are getting converted to blank values. Earlier they used to get printed correctly.

Hello we have the following configuration:
A SpreadsheetControl where we binded the SelectionChanged with a Checking function in our ViewModel to verify the validity of the selection by the user.
In some case the checking display a warning pop-up.
When we validate the pop-up the mouse is stucked in the selection state and the selection keep changing. 
We identified the problem to be the following:
The MouseUp event is never received by the SpreadSheetControl as it occurs on the pop-up.
We looked up for a SelectionFinished event or something similar. The goal was to do the checking only at the end of the selection and not dynamically.  But we didn't found one. 
As a consequence we are looking for a way to stop the Selection programmatically before displaying the pop-up. Is there a way to do so, without having to raise a MouseUp event ?

I have multiple dock panels residing on a dockmanager control.  At runtime, the top-left dock panel gets focus on itz first control and the tabbing just loops thru controls inside that particular dock panel.  Can you pls guide me on how I can get tabbing to work across dock panels on the form so that the focus moves from left->right and then top->bottom?  meaning once a last control in a dock panel is hit, tabbing moves to the first control in the adjacent dock panel instead of looping inside the same dock panel.

I'm using the ExcelDataSource.EditDataSource UI wizard to fill inn an ExcelDataSource to get the datasource settings from the user.

Hello,
I created an XAF Application storing data in a Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Database. One field of a XPObject is edited by a custom property editor handling RichEditUserControl.

Hi,
I'm currently creating a project that needs to present a spreadsheet for multiple users.
When the first user  makes a request to the view, which contains the spreadsheet, that document must be editable(readonly=false), but when another user makes the same request (and the previous user is still editing the document) the document must be locked(readonly=true).
Can you give me an ideia how should i create this behaviour?
Currently I'm creating a static variable in a class Helper, which is beeing used as the value for settings.ReadOnly. 
 I'll give bellow the piece of code related to this problem:
The variable MapaInfinsHelper.readonly is beeing changed in the function MapaInfinsHelper.PerformDataMerging() when the first user makes the request(starts with FALSE, then sets to TRUE). When the second user comes the static variable it's correct, but now the first user cant edit the document.

Scheduler view - 'Resources' 
3.1 In our scheduler we have several resources Practitioners and Locations. Patient appointments are linked to a practitioner and location. A practitioner can work at several locations (not at the same time of course). The standard available scheduler views of practitioners meet our requirements. 
Is it also possible to create a location view? In this view the appointments are selected per location per practitioner. So in stead of practitioners we select location A and all appointments linked to location A are presented (grouped) per practitioner: see 
  
3.2 And assume we select a second location, the view should be like as presented attachment. Locations A and B beside each other and on monday the appointments are grouped per practitioner. Is this possible somehow?
Looking forward to you answer. Many thanks in advance,

Working with the GridView control, I've got a column that only allows selection based on another column value.
I've managed the binding just fine, but the grid is displaying the Value, rather than the Text field info.
I bind using the BatchEditStartEditing Client Event, cmb_BagLine.PerformCallback(e.visibleIndex);
The Callback is defined in the _CellEditorInitialize Server Side Action 
I found I can get the Text value from the DataItemTemplate, but the Header Filter wasn't working.  I tried to change to Filter by the DisplayText, but it's still only filtering by the ValueField, rather than the TextField.
Is there a way I can bind the header to the Data Source so it filters correctly?

This field is interpreted in the component, so the displayed value has a human readable format (hh:mm:ss). 
Is it possible to use this format when exporting the data via the export function provided by your component?

Converting approximately 20 solutions from 17.1.3.0 to: 17.2.5.0 is creating by far more work than estimated. All solutions combined contain more than 50 data grids with various data and views. "SettingsCustomizationWindow" is now a major problem. 
Changelog review: 17.1.3.0 to: 17.2.5.0 does not mention anything about that change/ obsolete setting requiring now changes to be made to every single data grid.
Documentation in some topics lists  "SettingsCustomizationWindow" as current and valid some show it as obsolete.
 All documentation sections reference: "SettingsCustomizationWindow" showing: Devexpress.Web.v18.1.dll 
Guess that some documentation update would be helpful. 
In addition, documentation states that the default for: SettingsBehavior.EnableCustomizationWindow is False. When that default settings is in place and the obsolete property of: "SettingsCustomizationWindow Enabled = 'True'", the Customization window will open. This behavior was tested and verified using: 17.2.5.0. In my opinion, an obsolete setting/ property should be ignored but it should never change the default setting of any property assumed to be effective.
 


hi Alex,
Thanks for your support.
But pls see my attachment file. With 3 conditions (And, Or, And), why I got the value like that:



How could I know which condition is And / Or?

Since I upgraded DevExpress from v16.1 to 17.2.4, now 17.2.5, I am getting more and more often the "Cannot create a document for the current report" (without internal server error) error. I don't get any compile error or any error while debugging! This happens especially after "re-"debugging the project and refreshing the page. There are two cases where this error comes:
1. when I click the submit button to create the report
2. the user can save reports with specific selection of parameters (so the user doesn't have to re-enter the filter values), and when navigating to the page where those reports are listed the error comes up.
The error doesn't come always! And when not refreshing the previous page but working on the new browser tab or browser window, the error comes more rarely!
Is there any workaround, any solution or documentation about this issue?
I can't give you currently more information because I can't find what is causing this problem and which scenarios exactly, it just comes sometimes and sometimes not!!!

We are referring to code example
We have following toolbar buttons
        settings.Toolbars.Add(t =>
        {
            t.EnableAdaptivity = true;
            t.Items.Add(commanditem =>
            {
                commanditem.Name = "GetPackingData";
                commanditem.Text = "Get Packing Data";
                commanditem.Image.IconID = IconID.DataDatabase16x16office2013;
            });
            t.Items.Add(exportitem =>
            {
                exportitem.Name = "EmailExportToXLSX";
                exportitem.Text = "Export and Email to XLSX";
                exportitem.Image.IconID = IconID.ExportExporttoxlsx16x16office2013;
            });
            t.Items.Add(commanditem =>
            {
                commanditem.Name = "Approve";
                commanditem.Text = "Approve Data";
                commanditem.Image.IconID = IconID.ActionsApply16x16office2013;
            });
            t.Items.Add(GridViewToolbarCommand.ShowCustomizationWindow);
        });
        settings.ClientSideEvents.ToolbarItemClick = "OnToolbarItemClick";
    function OnToolbarItemClick(s, e) {
        if (e.item.name == 'GetPackingData')
            PackingDataGridView.PerformCallback();
        else if (e.item.name == 'Approve')
            onApproveClick(s, e);
    }
I am happy the way client side handler works, however for EmailExportToXLSX we want server-side call (may be using javascript), so we can export grid to xlsx and email to logged in user. How can we achieve this? 

Hi,
I have a protected worksheet with some cells unlocked. When I copy some cells range form Excel and paste it to any unlocked cell in my dxSpreadSheet, all cells are copied, also these which are pasted to locked cells.
In such situation Excel forbids pasting what is an expected behavior.
Steps to reproduce bug:
1) prepare a protected sheet where a single cell will be unlocked (editable).
2) copy some range (more than a single cell) form other Excel file
3) paste copied data to this single unlocked cell in a dxSpreadSheet.
4) see when a locked cells content is replaced too.

I have a custom implementation of an IListServer that I use paired with grid controls to create a dynamically loaded list.  Since the upgrade to 17.2 (was on 14.2), I am finding that the Apply method is no longer called reliably when I change the sort order in the grid (in the past it worked all the time).  What is the correct way to capture the sort change events in the IListServer linked to a gridcontrol in 17.2?

Hi,
We got a hang in our Report Designer  when we are changing text alignment of a label ( or when changing the datamember of a detailed report band).
I read about a similar issue reported (see the link below), and I think we have the same issue.
There is a workaround suggested in that ticket, that I think does not work in our case for our report designer.
Can you please let me know if there is any workaround for this issue in report designer without updating our devex to a given hotfix version?
Thank you,

Hi,
 I am using the PivotGrid and i need to use head bands in PivotArea.ColumnArea.
Eg:
var settings = new PivotGridSettings();
            settings.Fields.Add(field =>
            {
                field.Area = PivotArea.ColumnArea;
                field.AreaIndex = 2;
                field.FieldName = "Rx";
                field.Caption = "Rx";
            });
            settings.Fields.Add(field =>
            {
                field.Area = PivotArea.ColumnArea;
                field.AreaIndex = 2;
                field.FieldName = "Indicator";
                field.Caption = "Indicator";
            });
In the gridview i simply use settings.Columns.AddBand. How can i achieve the same behaviour in pivot?
Regards, 

Hi,
I use the GridView with the Compact theme.
The display of the grouped rows arrows  is a little bit confusing:
The arrow of the group should point to the bottom when the group is opened.
The arrow of the group should point to the  top when the group is closed.
 But now the direction of the arrow changes whenever the group gets activated/deactivated.
Instead it should be static...
Please find the demo video attached.
Kind regards

We have implemented a data grid on a web page with a chart.
The visibility of each is controlled by clicking on the tabs (chart or drill down).
The chart contains a series of filters users can apply.  Those filter values are used to get the data rows for the datagrid.
A context menu is used to instantiate the datagrid and assign it's datasource at runtime.
Our datasource is a custom store.
We are finding that if the datagrid is loading data and the user clicks the tab to return to the chart and later clicks on the drill down tab to return to the grid that the header row is not lining up with the data rows in the grid.
Resizing the window will cause the header row to line back up with the grid.
Is there a way to make the header row redraw itself when the tabs are clicked?
These are the current settings for the datagrid.




And this is the custom store.

We have a dxDataGrid we are using to display a large dataset from a custom datastore. In order to handle the large volume of data, infinite scrolling is enabled. When the dxDataGrid is rebuilt in Google Chrome, the scrollbar's position is saved and this causes the infinite scrolling to continuously trigger.
I am looking for a way to force the scrollbar to be reset when the datasource is rebound. I have already tried to implement the fix found 
 each time the dataSource is rebound (both before and afterward), but that seems to have no effect in Google Chrome.
To rebind the grid we are doing the following:
1.) Setting the dataSource option on the DataGrid to an empty array
2.) Calling dxDataGrid on the grid element and re-passing all parameters that were used to instantiate it including the DevExpress.data.CustomStore. The settings are as follows:
$(".drilldown-grid").dxDataGrid({
            columns: [{
                columns: [{ dataField: 'StudentID', caption: 'Student ID' }, 
                    { dataField: 'StudentName', caption: 'Student Name' }, 
                    { dataField: 'Gender', caption: 'Gender' }, 
                    { dataField: 'Ethnicity', caption: 'Ethnicity' }, 
                    { dataField: 'SchoolYear', caption: 'School Year' }, 
                    { dataField: 'Grade', caption: 'Grade' }, 
                    { dataField: 'SchoolName', caption: 'School Name' }, 
                    { dataField: 'Department', caption: 'Course Department' }, 
                    { dataField: 'CourseName', caption: 'Course Name' }, 
                    { dataField: 'TeacherName', caption: 'Course Teacher' }, 
                    { dataField: 'Period', caption: 'Period' }, 
                    { dataField: 'AbsenceReason', caption: 'Reason' }, 
                    { dataField: 'DateAbsent', caption: 'Date Absent' }]
            }],
            "dataSource": records,
            filterRow: {
                visible: false
            },

            },
            height: 500,

                visible: false
            },

Hello Uriah,
I tested the RolesMergingMode option. It seems to do exactly what I need except one thing - if user belongs to any role that doesn't have any permission for given type defined (even completely empty role), the access to the type is denied.
For example there are 2 roles - the first allows navigation and read permission to Person type. The second one is empty. User usr1 belongs to both roles. In this configuration, access to Person is denied.
Please see attached screenshots.
It would make more sense to me if a role that does not contain any permission for given type would be ignored for permission calculation. 
Would it be possible to change the permission processing in this way?
Otherwise, it would be necessary to grant permission to a type in all roles.
Thank you

Sizing a Docking Panel (horizontally) doesn't repaint correctly.
E.g. start the demo: "WinForms" - "Ribbon And Menu" - "Photo Viewer " and then size any dock panel or container horizontally - you'll see, that many gray lines are printed while dragging the panel size - they only disappear once you release the mouse.
This odd behavior  is new in v17.2.5.

Hi,
I have a question for you.

I need to create a simple template when I generate a label and textbox for any properties of my ExpandoObject. How can I do this?
This is my xaml.cs code:
    
and this is my xaml code:
the items must be recreated every time that I change the SelectedObject because the new Expando object could have other properties with other value.

Hi Guys,
 I'm not sure what I am doing wrong, although I am unable to restore the filter string when calling RestoreLayoutFromStream.
I have a grid, with one band and one column.
If I save the layout,  I can see the filter string in the XML.
When I restore the layout, it sets some properties, but not the filter string!  
I have read online that we need to set the band name, that hasn't helped.
Steps:
* Load the sample
* Set a filter via the small icon on the column header
* Change the column width
* Save the layout
* Remove the filter and change the width back
* Restore from layout
- Column width is restored, auto filter row is populated with the filter, but the filter is not applied.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
David 

We recently decided documents must open in new windows so users can look at other data for the document they are composing. After opening a new window using <a target="_blank" ... /> in IE 11, the user gets this error on DXR.axd (93027,4) and fails to load the document:
SCRIPT5007: Unable to get property 'OnCalendarFinishAnimation' of undefined or null reference
 In this example, the only code that is different from where it worked before is the layout page. The view and the partials are literally the same files. Understanding what I need to correct on the attached layout is my top priority so it works in IE. None of these errors occur in Chrome, so it seems to be an issue of additional resources.

I get an error message for the data binding from an ASP Combobox of: Description: An error occurred during the parsing of a resource required to service this request. Please review the following specific parse error details and modify your source file appropriately. 
Parser Error Message: The ListEditItem control with a two-way databinding to field BranchAbbr must have an ID.
I have created a custom edit template with an asp gridview as a test for a larger productions page. This test page has five data columns on it, four of them are textboxes that are working and the last I use a asp combobox list a list of data from a SQL database table. The data binding to the column that I need to set the data to from the combobox selection does not work. This is the code I am using, the is with BranchAbbr field column.



Hello,
We are using various UI widgets from the DevExtreme library in a ASP.NET MVC web application.
As part of it we are using the SelectBox (dxSelectBox).
We have noticed an issue when running the web app in iPhone and iPad. The issue can be replicated in both safari and chrome. The problem is that, when you try to select an item from any of the SelectBox controls, nothing gets selected. In other words, the list is presented and when you select any of the items (in this case, touch on any of the items) the actual selection doesn't stick as the selected item in the control.
The interesting thing is that we were able to replicate the exact same problem in the DevExtreme Demo page  
Everything works OK running this demo in a desktop (we tested safari, chrome, firefox, ie and edge), However, running this same demo in iPhone or iPad (in both safari or chrome) results in the same problem I just described. When trying make a selection in any of the select boxes, the selction just doesn't work.
This is a time sensitive issue for us, as we are about to go live with our web site. We are even considering going live with this as a known issue but we need a fix or perhaps a workaround.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
J. Mirabal
 

Hi,
when you copy cell form excel to dxSpreadSheet it copies also Locked property when the source cell is formatted (i.e. bold). 
So when the destination Sheet  (id dxSpreadSheet) is protected and one copies cell to unlocked cell it becomes locked (non editable).
- it happens only when source cell has any format on it (not default one). 
Steps to reproduce:
1) prepare in Excel a sheet with some cell range unlocked.
2) enable protection in this sheet.
3) save it for future use as dst.xlsx
4) prepare application with dxSpreadSheet on it
5) run application and load prepared dst.xlsx file
6) open new excel put some value to A1, make it bold (or apply any other formatting)
7) copy this cell
8) paste this cell on SpreadSheet in your application to any unlocked cell
9) try to edit this cell - it now is not editable - the default locked state was copied (and it was set)
Excel in such situation leaves this cell Editable - discards locked value from source cell.

I have a <dx-popup> element in my component template and I want to add a dxLoadPanel such that it covers and shades the entire popup container not just the content (including header and toolbars).
I tried using  
but this doesn't work because the id attribute I assigned to the dx-popup element doesn't actually get applied to the instanced popup at runtime.
How can I make this work? 


Thanks, the above worked.
Now, I would also like to check whether the map information (as displayed in google's search result) is available for us to access (ref. highlighted area in

Hello support,
my scenario is that i need to know if inside an IFrame in a DetailView there are any modifications, and if yes,on changing view, I would like to show the message like the one of the WebConfirmUnsavedChangesDetailViewController to notice the user that he has some unsaved changes. 
I already have a javascript functions that returns if the IFrame has modifications or not, and it would be useful to extend the WebConfirmUnsavedChangesDetailViewController to check both my javascript function and the controller's check. Is there a way to acomplish this task?
 
Thank you,
Giuseppe

I have the same problem after upgrading to 17.2.5, but only when an item has been added to the tagBox by another control.
We are using an Autocomplete to search for people then adding it to the tagbox, this was working in in version 16 I believe.
I have recreated the problem on codepen: 
Click on the star button to add the person to the tagbox, then attempt to remove them.
It's fine if you set the datasource to the Email object.

Hi Team,
We are using DevExpress.Xpf.Docking.DockLayoutManager to display various windows. We have a main window which is docked, and an pop up floating window.  However, our user report if there is another pop up (from other application) showed and get focus and after user close the pop up, instead of returning the focus to main window where user is working with, it will return the focus to floating window.
I am trying to set ShowActivated as False on Floating window see if that solve the issue, but seems I can't find the  FloatingPaneWindow from LayoutPanel. Could you please advise any way to stop floating window steal focus from main window?
 var window = DevExpress.Xpf.Core.Native.LayoutHelper.GetTopLevelVisual(windowPanel) as FloatingPaneWindow;

Hi,
I am wondering if there is a way to show customized control in the excel filter drop down .

Hello,
I'm creating a custom notification with the following template:
 Here's the creation and the view model:
 
Now, the UpdateImportProgress method in the view model gets triggered during an import function and the ImportProgressInPercent does get updated, however, the changes do not reflect in the view. If I set the property to a different value upon creating the notification I can see the changed value, but it also doesn't change afterwards. How do I get the notification to show the progress?

Hello,
I've defined an IList property on my viewmodel and I bind it to the SelectedItems property of the  GridControl, but when selection changes the binded property is not updated.
How can I do this? 
Thanks,

i have the custom function dialog working well with gridcontrol. 
is there a way to format a string given a value? when i print values they give me 15 digits of precision.
            _gridColumn.AllowUnboundExpressionEditor    =true
            _gridColumn.UnboundExpression               = "Concat('Temperature: ', ToStr([Ch1 Vin+.1.1.1.1]), 'C')"
also, is there a way for me to insert my own function that would do formating ?
e.g.
    ToFormattedStr(double valueString, string formatString)
{
  return valueString.ToString(formatString)
} 
then end user could do
     ToFormattedStr(double valueString, 'G')
 

Dear Support! 
We have recently upgraded DevExpress Nugets from 17.1.6 to 17.2.5
We need your help to clarify regression in the functionality of "FORMAT RULES" contextual menu in the PivotGrid 17.2.5 version.
It appears that in 17.2.5 Single Mouse "Right Click"  will immediately display 
expanded "Format Rules" sub menu  
actually displaying 
 
root sub menu element. 
If we attempt to append/include "Format Rule" sub menu to any existing context menu
the sub menu elements will attach to the root menu without a nice sub menu divider ("Format Rules")
In 17.1.6 we see that "Format Rule" sub menu consistently present in Right Click scenarios 
as well as during inclusion of the Format Rules in the  more complex parent menu
I can replicate this problem 100% of the time.
I have attached 2 solutions that have IDENTICAL code that includes empty PIVOT GRID with
this.pivotGridControl1.OptionsMenu.EnableFormatRulesMenu = true;
In the ZIP file you will see 2 folders  Pivot.17.2 and Pivot.17.1
You will find a screenshot in each folder that clearly demonstrates the issue.
Currently this is a show stopper for us as it messes up our CONTEXT menus in the PIVOT GRIDs.
Your immediate attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.
Since I added actual Dlls the file is > 30Mb   (Silly limit?)

I used the HybridDemo as startingpoint for an application.
On one form I have a cxGrid just to select the record to work on.
Data entry should be done via a second cxGrid, the editfields are contained in a DBLayoutview.
The standard behaviour is that using the mousewheel scrolls the records of the table.
This is a sure way to confuse the operator if it accidentally selects another record in this way.
Since I found no other way to prevent this the DBLayoutview is connected to a second table that works as a slave to the main table but provides only the currently selected record.
So I am sure the user can only scroll records in the selection grid, not in the data entry grid.
To access all the editfields in the DBLayoutview the user must vertically scroll.
I specified scrollbars = ssVertical and scrolling in this way (vertical scrollbar) works properly.
The mousewheel has no function if the cursor is over the data entry grid.
The question is if there is a way to scroll through the editfields with the mousewheel in addition to the scrollbar.

I need that when I right click and choose New Appointment on my ASPxScheduler the text located in a ASPxTextBox on the same page will be added to my subject field for the new appointment.

Hi,
I'm trying to fix a reported bug that has to do with the paste option from a context menu.  To duplicate, I created a simple test application.  This application uses a client dataset and creates 10 data rows in memory.  To duplicate the problem:
- make sure you have some text in your clipboard
- run the application
- put focus in either the edit field or the memo.  Leave focus there.
- right click from the field with focus and you'll see the standard context menu and the paste option will be enabled
- click the navigator to go to the last record in the dataset.  
- now when you right click on the field with focus, the paste option is disabled.  Scrolling through the dataset (via the navigator) doesn't fix it.
If you change focus to another field, the paste option is available again.   It's also interesting to note, that even when the paste option is disabled, ctrl-V still works (proving there is still text in the clipboard).
Can you help?  Seems trivial, but we have a customer who relies on this type of thing.
Thanks,
Dan 

I am getting 'Cannot read property 'props' of undefined' error. Can you please suggest solution to this issue?

Hello,
I created a form with a tilecontrol. Within the tilecontrol I show directories on a hard disk orderd by a-z. On the  form I also have buttons with the characters a-z. I want to jump to the first tileitem with started with "d" when I presse the "D" button.
Is there a method availale which allows me to jump to the first "d" tileitem or do I need to go thru all tileitems and check whether it starts with "d" and select it manually ?
I attached a screenshot how the form looks like.
Thanks and regards
Uwe

I am using the webchartcontrol and using the funnel type chart.  I run the report fine but I the legend is showing the numbers  for the series point and not the string provided in the "s.Points.Add(new SeriesPoint("StringValue", numval))".  How do I set the legend to show the string and not the number.  Below is my code.
Series s = new Series("Funnel", ViewType.Funnel);
 if (chartTypeStr == "Funnel") { wbc[wbcNum].SeriesTemplate.View = new FunnelSeriesView(); }
 if (chartTypeStr == "Funnel3D") { wbc[wbcNum].SeriesTemplate.View = new Funnel3DSeriesView(); }
foreach (DataRow row in dtWBC.Rows)
{
      int numval = 0;
      bool result = int.TryParse(row["ChartCounter"].ToString(), out numval);
                        
     s.Points.Add(new SeriesPoint("StringValue", numval));
}
 wbc[wbcNum].Series.Add(s);

I have a tcxGrid with multiple views.  When using a normal view the: 
CurrentView.StoreToIniFile(LocalDir+'searchresults.ini',
                                 true,[gsoUseFilter, gsoUseSummary]);
works great!.
However when I start with an empty view and create the columns on the fly, it does not save the columns and filters.  Is there something additional I need to do when I create the view on the fly?
Thank you,

Hello
When exporting a databound Gridview, the data does not appear in the XLS file. The column headers are present, but without any data underneath them. I am unable to find a solution to this problem.
The Gridview is being  populated from a LINQ query code-side. That query is then set as the Datasource to populate the gridview. The data shows up on-page, just not in the file that is downloaded.
Above is the code I am using for the export. it triggers after an export button is clicked.

Hello!
I have a splitter and a combobox with rather long items in it. 
The popup list is being hidden by the splitter and one can't see the full items.
How can I make the popup list appear over the splitter?
What are the DevEx ComboBox settings to use to make sure that a long text value doesn't stretch the ComboBox outside of my Splitter area.
Is there any other way to solve the problem?

I have a ComboBox with values in it and some of the values have spaces.
For some reason the ComboBox posts the desired value, but whenever there is 
a space in the selected item the ComboBox posts the desired value BUT with additional 
values separated by commas.
How can I make the ComboBox post the desired value only?

Hi,
I am working with the Data Grid, and I would like for one of my columns to have a default value applied to the filter in the Filter Row.
The column I would like to current has a Yes/No drop down selection box filter, and I would like for it to default to 'No' instead of 'All'. 
I have attached an image with the desired outcome. Is this possible? Could you provide some example?

Hi.
I need to be able to dynamically set the connectionstring and datasource for the XtraReport Designer. The scenario is this:
1. A user opens the application and starts designing a report from a choosen source of data. This could be a Stored Procedur, a WebService or whatever. This creates a local Sqlite-databas on the server, unique for the user, his session and hit TAB. This means should he open another tab and do the same thing another another sqlite-db is created.
2. The way we separate this is that we have our own "internal sessionobject" in the session with a GUID as id, and this GUID is autogenerated and in all URL's for the user in his TAB. Should he open another TAB a new "internal sessionobject"  is created and a new GUID will be generated and in the url for this tab.
3. Our internal sessionobject keeps track of connectionstring to the Sqlite-db (which part of the name is our internal GUID sessionid). How can we set this in the ReportDesigner dynamically?
In our global.asa we have the following:
And in the WizardConnStringsProvider:
But this is the line where it goes wrong:
Because if the user now opens another tab OR another user starts the application, they will all get mismatched connectionstrings.
So I think my questions are:
1. Is it it any way possible in the WizardConnStringsProvider get hold of the QueryString? It always returns null....
2. Is there any way possible in the codebehind of the ReportDesigner.aspx to "get hold of" and manipulate the WizardConnStringsProvider? By example setting the correct values in page_load?
3. What are your recommendations?
Thanks
P.s In a Dashboard we have solved it like this:
Is it possible to do something like that with the xtraReport?
D.s

This form is editing the 7 values for a project as you can see in the "AddSimpleFor" lines.  The 8th property is "ID", but I don't want to edit that, I just want to pass it to the LoadParams of the datagrid in the 8th "AddSimple" item.
Notice how I've hard-coded the ProjectID for the load params to 21.

I have a banded grid control that has several columns that use the spinedit repository items to edit the cells.  Two of the spinedit's are located under a 'Used Material' section and two are located under a 'Return Material' section (see attached image).  I would like to have the spinedit values under the 'Return Material' section automatically updated when the spinedit's under the 'Used Material' section are being changed.  
if you look at the attached image, I want to be able to subtract  the total of the blue spinedits from the yellow length and fill in the green spinedit.
I can get the value of the spinedit that has focus and is currently being changed, but cannot figure out how to get the value of the second spinedit that does not have focus.  I also can't figure out how to fill in the values for the other two spinedits.
Hope this makes sense,
Thanks,


Hi Guys,
currently we are on 17.2.5 and have DirectXPaint enabled. we have one device (Win10) where we currently regulary get random outofmemory exceptions - even if the application only uses 400-500 mb. today we tested with disabled DirectX which seems to fix the issue. are there any Infos on how we could Isolate the problem on this machine? callstacks look like this, which seems the application has a Problem to paint Images:





















I am using Winform "DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl" and binding a DataTable to it. I am not manually creating columns to bind, so using the default behavior. The Grid display the data in editable format. I want to present a Read Only or View only display. How can I do this? Its 

HI Lanette ,
Could you please provide sample  on how to prepare series and animation ,zooming X,Y,Secondary multiple  y  axses in codebehiond(C#) and binding data to x,y ,sereies is using data table which is filed using database .
 

I have a simple Master-Detail BootStrapGridView, and would like to be able to manage the detail grids (Add, Edit, Delete). Is this currently supported, and if so, could you please point me to an example? Thanks in advance.

Hello.
My scripts are broken everywhere because some changes that were made on your dx.all.d.ts file.
These are the problems:
======================
- dxPivot, dxDataGrid, dxLookupOptions breakings
dataSource members are breaking my KnockoutObservable<any> assignments.
So  I noticed the interface now forces:
==>>    string | Array<any> | DevExpress.data.DataSource | DevExpress.data.DataSourceOptions
It should be <any> because you dont know what datasource one would use AND consume.
Also, getting the array from the observable datasource is impossible (I.E.  var array = grid.dataSource()   <-- throws error)
======================
- DevExpress.ui.dxPopupToolbarItemOptions is missing
It is definitely removed? Have something in the functionality (the js code) somewhat removed also?
if the js code is intact can you summon that interface back?
I have changed your dx.all.d.ts so I can have the project back, but it will break everything again after every upgrade.
Can you help me addressing these issues?

The default message on the pop up for Angular Data Grid on Delete row click is "Are you sure you want to delete this record? " Can you please let me know how can we change this message to a custom message.? Thanks.

Hello:
After upgrading to 17.2.5 from 17.2.4, I'm getting  E1035 error (see attached screenshot) when:
1) The grid contains columns that are pushed in the "customizeColumns" method.
2) The error occurs when the "Edit" button is clicked which is when the edit form is created. 
I cannot give you right now a sample to reproduce the issue but if needed I can make one and send you. Please help.
Thanks!

What I am trying to do is show/hide an ASPxPanel based on the value of a field in a card.  So, when switching to a new card, it will look at the new card to determine whether to show/hide the ASPxPanel.  Any help would be appreciated.

I am using AngularJS as my javascript framework.
When trying to set up a form using the dx-Form control, I am unable to set it up properly in my javascript as it will only accept parameters as strings.
 Example:
---- This will create a form with one column
$scope.formOptions = {
            bindingOptions: {
                
                formData: "d",
                colCount: 2,
                width: "800"
            }
        };
VS
---- This will create a form with two columns
$scope.formOptions = {
            bindingOptions: {
                
                formData: "d",
                colCount: "2",
                width: "800"
            }
        };
In both instances, the formData and width attributes must have their values as strings.  
Another issue is with the items attribute. When trying to order or customize my fields in any way I run into big problems. 
---- This will order the fields as shown
$scope.formOptions = {
            bindingOptions: {
                
                formData: "d",
                colCount: "2",
                width: "800",
                items: "['field3','field1','field2']"
            }
        };
VS
---- This will not order the fields as shown. The fields will be in whatever order they are in in the data source.
$scope.formOptions = {
            bindingOptions: {
                
                formData: "d",
                colCount: "2",
                width: "800",
                items: ['field3','field1','field2']
            }
        };
Attempting to do anything more than this yields no results. I only get the basic form.
 

I have been trying to figure out the method that will work like the example in  Ticket T278629  
I have included a project that I am using to get the correct behavior.  I modeled it after the example here.
 In this example the RepositoryItemMemoExEdit has a method "AllowClosePopup" that can be overridden.  In RepositoryItemPopupGalleryEdit this method doesn't exist. 

In our web application we have a datagrid with a custom store calling a MVC returning JSON result to populate the grid.
When exporting is enabled only the rows that have been loaded to the page are exported.  Is there a way that all records can be exported?

The Dev Express Template Gallery does not let me create ASP.Net web site projects in Visual Studio 2017.  
How can I use the Dev Express Template Gallery to create an ASP.net web site project in Visual Studio 2017? 

I have a pivotgrid that has two grand totals at the bottow row. In order to have two grand totals. I have to make a few changes. One of those changes is to set OptionsDataField.Area to PivotDataArea.RowArea. This causes the layout of the pivot to distort causing the last column (Used in Blend) to over-expand its column width. Also there is an extra column called Data. I would like to remove the column. 

Hello,
I have a web user control widget that contains a gridview (gridView A). In my aspx page, it contains another gridview(gridView B) and two popup controls. One of the popup controls contains the widget. In gridView B,there is a column that has a href that calls a javascript funtion as shown below.
I set a break point on the ShowPopup function. If gridView A's editing Mode is set to batch, that ShowPopup javascript function will not trigger after the hyperlink is clicked. If gridView A's editing Mode is set to the options other than batch, it works properly. What is the reason? and how should I solve it?

We are experiencing a problem with printing from the pdf viewer.  Users will be able to print for a while and then they will lose the ability to print unless they close the application and restart.  After restarting they are able to print again for a while. I attempted to enable legacy printing and that did not help.  I have also gone through our code and tried to make sure the PDFViewer was being disposed when the form or control it is is used on is closed/disposed.
When the problem occurs no errors are generated.  The print dialog appears briefly and shows the spooling message. Only page 1 is displayed before the dialog closes.  If the print queue manager window is open while this is happening, you can see the print job appears briefly and then quickly disappears.
Printers:  Kyocera FS-2100DN Driver version: KX Print Driver v7.3.1207
We have also seen this on an HP printer.

Hi there DX folks,
I'm trying to use structures and non-persistent classes in conjuction with DomainComponents on an application with Middle-Tier security. I had have success with this task before on other applications that don't use middle-tier security.
Thus far I have encountered three problematic scenarios.
Attached there are Two Solutions with almost identical code, one with Middle-Tier security and the other without it. There is also pictures.
A DomainComponent  with a property of a type  that is a structure fails with an exception when trying to save the DomainComponent.
To reproduce: Open "Use Structure" list view click "New", on the detail view "Click Save"
Workaround: Don't use Structures, they are handy but not strictily necessary, just copy and paste the columns on domain components that needs it, if you only need one reference to the structure per DC you could create a non-persistent base DC to inherit from. It may become a little messy if you had a bunch of them but I'll work.
A DomainComponent with a property of a type that is non-persistent class fails with an exception is that property is part used in a RuleCombinationOfPropertiesIsUnique when trying to save the DomainComponent.
To reproduce: Open "Use Non Persistent" list view click "New", on the detail view look for the "Values" nested list, create a new "UseNewPersistent_SpecialValue" object, on the (yet another) detail view click "Save".
Workaround: In my case I could use for the rule the hidden persistent property that is used to calculate the non-persistent one, but in that case I get the validation error popup, but not the validation indicator on the property.
Following the 
 shows an empty list. For some reason the ObjectSpace on the controller is an XPObjectSpace instead of a NonPersistentObjectSpace. I did not leave the example but the same occurs when trying to show a 
.
To reproduce: Open "My Value" list view From navigation
Workaround: Create a Non-Persistent class that contains the list, show the detail view of such class from the navigation. When initializing the object for the detailview create it manually (
)
(This is a new scenario, updated code and pictures are attached on a comment)
I'm trying to show a summary of items similar to this 
. But instead of calculating the results on memory, I'm trying to do it on the database using 
 And instead of a string property, I'm trying to group by a calculated enum property. It fails with an exception.
To reproduce: Open "Am Queried"  list view, create some objects, on the list view click "Show Summary By Calulated Type"
Workaround: Create another non browsable calculated string property and group by it, so you still get to use the enum one (possibly with images). Or if there aren't lots of items you could materialize (with 
 or 
) the list before grouping and group on the client instead of on the server.

Hi,
I am trying to order a dxDataGrid by the selected rows, I tried to implement sortingMode function but such code is never reached.
How can I achieve this behavior? I need to bind the grid, then check against another array variable to set certain rows selected as default and then order by those selected rows so they appear at top of the grid. Here is my code snippet. Thanks

Hello - I am currently using CSS classes and setting the following properties of the Bootstrap GridView:
CssClasses-Table
CssClasses-HeaderRow
CssClasses-Row
When I export to Excel, these styles get ignored.  For regular DevExpress GridViews I was able to set this property, which would just apply the styles to match how the GridView  was displayed:
DevExpress.Export.ExportSettings.DefaultExportType = DevExpress.Export.ExportType.WYSIWYG;
However this property seems to have no effect on the Bootstrap Gridview.  Then I looked at the tutorial you have here:  
But this demo sets the styles for each individual column.  This is not practical for us because we have hundreds of grids that would need to be converted to using FormatConditions.  Is there a way to export the data for a Bootstrap Gridview control to Excel using the formatting that gets displayed on the web page(Similar to how WYSIWYG worked)?  Or are there global settings I can use? 
 

Hi,
I have a ListBoxEdit control which I am using to provide selection of values to the user.
The selection works fine, however, when the user clicks on something else, causing the ListBoxEdit to loose focus, the selection color is lost too. 
I am using Metropolis Dark theme. 
Is there a way to maintain the selection for the ListBoxEditItem even when the focus is lost?
The functionality similar to the FadeSelectionOnLostFocus for TableView of GridControl.
Please suggest.
Thanks,

Hey,
Just wondering if someone could help us with a small issue.
We are using Dev Express on our custom user control(winforms).
We have a Accordion Control and are using  AccordionContextButton for some text buttons for users to do some actions.
Just wondering if it was possible to change the on hover event to change the users mouse cursor to the hand icon, to indicate it's a button?
I've had a look over the API and I can't seem to find a method to do this.
Thanks!

Hello! I wanted to follow up on a past issue B198993, where i was trying to use Appearance rules in a nonpersistent object.
I wanted to see if many years later, there is a way to handle this properly now? I believe the NonPersistentObjectSpaceProvider is new during this time, is that something I can utilize here to make this work as expected?
Thank you!

Hello all.
Since I put some javascript code  -that devexpress suggested me some days ago to resize the chart depending the browser sizing- the bootstrap pie charts going crazy.
Since that moment, the pie chart animation effect is not working properly. 
Please, see the image below, I tried to produce a video, but I could not This image is based in 5 screenshots that I took in the chart animation.
So far I know this is not the normal behavior. As you cans see in the image, the "complete pie" is growing up. I expected that every slice appears one by one (as yoiur samples).

I have a Xaf Winforms MDI Tabbed Application and I want for all users to show a predefined list view at start up. I have used the techniques described in the KB but I cannot make it work properly. I managed to create the predefined view in one tab at start up and to assign this view to the StartUpNavigationItem but the application selects the last tab the user had selected when he closed the application. 
I want the focus to be on the tab I created without focusing on any of the tabs the user had when he closed the application. 
Could you please help me with this?

Hi, I am trying to create a button that uses the @ string to do localization. Here is the problem:
1) HTML Binding Works
This button will correctly put the text associated with the billTotal  language entry into the text of the button, in a default button and the onClick works.
2) Knockout Biding Does Not Work
with javascript of:
This button displays the string @billTotal as the text of the button, in a default button and the onClick works.
I don't want to have to embed all of my binding objects into the HTML, this seems like a bug in the system in some way. Any explanation you can give me would be appreciated.

Hi, 
I am trying to achieve this 
. I manage to customize the template but I can't make the text foreground use the same color that the hamburger menu is using. Also is it possible make an oval background behind the text that is using devexpress theme color? Attached is a sample project I'm working on. Hope you can help. Thanks!

Hi DevExpress Support,
I understand from documentation & from my previous discussions with DevExpress technical support, 
 event is used to for cell level customization. I followed this approach and I have few queries regarding the performance.
Above code is fairly simple (I have even more complex usage in my project), in this piece of code I'm just setting 
 on Cells based on defined criteria. Obviously you might notice that I'm creating many 
 objects (Font is immutable), this leads error 
(Screenshots attached) . I even used perfmon to monitor number of objects sitting around and the number getting promoted to higher Generations, trust me it is pretty high.   
Based on above I have following questions -
1. Are there any way to avoid creating 
 objects?
2. Is there anyway we can safely dispose these objects (Any API call)?   
3. I have also noticed a performance degradation when subscribing to "
" event (Screenshot Attached).
I really appreciate any quickest help on these queries.
Thanks,
Hari Prasad 
  

Hello,
I was wondering if you could provide or point me in the direction of how to implement filtering like how is done in the DevAV demo. Specifically, I would like to have the two following functionalities:
1) I want to be able to launch the filter builder popup from a button in the toolbar, rather than a row below the table, like the built in functionality does.
2) I want to be able to save/persist custom filters - how are the filter expressions persisted, and how can I access this data?
Thanks!

in my js code, I called 3 times 'PerformCallback' like this
dtgTurnAround.PerformCallback(parameters);
the 3 times' parameters value is  always like this:
1st time: empty
2nd time: owner|123
3nd time:plant|567
so I want to get the result which is from the 3rd  PerformCallback, but when I debug the code, I found the callback code method 'dtgTurnAround_CustomCallback', the order is not same as what I wanted, maybe parameter 'owner|123' is the 3rd executed, so the result is wrong,
Is there any method to make the the executed order same as js order? 

Hi, We had purchase a license of DevExpress, it works fine on my local machine, but it returns error when i deployed it on our local IIS, here is the error it returns.
"Could not load file or assembly 'DevExpress.Data.v14.1, Version=14.1.6.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b88d1754d700e49a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified. "
Can someone please help me on this, i'm on a tight schedule.

Hi,
I have a data source with data store configured  like this:
new DevExpress.data.DataSource(new DevExpress.data.CustomStore({
          loadMode: "raw",
          load: loadLookupFunction
        }))
The loadLookupFunction is calling remote server and return jQuery promise.  
This setup works with most widgets like dxSelectBox, dxTagBox,  dxDataGrid but i get an error when I use it with a lookup property in a dxDataGrid column. 
The error message is:
"TypeError: this._scheduleLoadCallbacks is not a function"
I made a plunker to show that: 
There are 2 widgets dxDataGrid with a lookup column which throws an error, and dxTagBox that works fine. Both use the same data source configuration.  
Could you please assist me in getting this to work? Is that kind of data store compatible with a lookup widget?

Good morning,
we have considered updating to 17.1.9. But it seems the errors in the RichEditControl haven't been fixed.
Please see attached .gif 
1) When i switch to readonly = false the comments are still readonly. Only after editing them in the review pane they become editable
2) When i select all text of one comment in the review pane i cannot delete it
3) When i select the last two lines or so of one comment and click a key, the editor replaces the text in the next comment 
I didn't bother to test any further. Do you know theese bugs? Are they fixed in the newest version ?
Kind regards 
Martin

We are using your Line chart control  and Bar chart control, On showing values in the chart the series point values go outside the container, From the figure our series point value is 290 but the Y axis of the chart is shown up to a maximum of 270. We need to show the next higher value on the Y axis to make the highest series point inside the graph. For example, if 290 is the case, then a maximum of Y axis must be at least 300  or 330.

In week view when are resources grouped by date day names in day header are displayed incorrectly. As from my review in procedure SchedulerCustomDrawDayHeader value AViewInfo.Datetime does not contain date. Image is taken from CustomDrawDemo

In the context of the problem 
, watch the video.
Here is the code for the example:
The "Position" and "Department" related by many to many. After adding the "Department" to the collection of "Departments" from the "Position", I expect that the link request in the current transaction will return the collection with the added "Department".

I'm trying to resize (larger) my controls (memo, textbox) in the Gridview PopupEditForm, I searched your database but it seems that in my case all the solutions are not working.
what did I try:
- popup width 1000px and controls 100% or *px
- used a aspxmemo control in EditItemTemplate
It is working with aspxlabel control

Hi,
I've seen some similar requests on the forum, but no answer to this particular question. 
I'd like to visually separate the rows a bit better in the ASPxGridView - particularly when the PreviewRow is in effect.
I realize I can manipulate the PreviewRow style, but to that extent, I can only make it "taller" which is a step in the right direction. But better would be a gap separating the rows. Let me rephrase that... a gap that is the neutral background colour. Or a clearly defined box around each row.
So visually it present like:
---------------------------------------------------------
Row 1
Row 1 Preview 
---------------------------------------------------------
[gap here]
---------------------------------------------------------
Row 2
Row 2 Preview 
---------------------------------------------------------
[gap here]
---------------------------------------------------------
Row x
Row x Preview 
---------------------------------------------------------
I've looked closely at the HTML rendering and can't seem to find an element to manipulate this. I tried something like this:
But it had no effect oddly?!?!
If there isn't a way to do this via pure CSS? Or should I be looking at event handlers such as HTMLRowPrepared? It seems to me, injecting an empty <tr> would do the trick, but that feels very "hack-ish"
Suggestions?

We use the following ChartControl to show a series of data points with error bars. For some of the data points, we do not have an error and the Properties PositiveError and NegativeError given as PositiveErrorDataMember and NegativeDataMember are null (they are of type double?).
I am looking for a way to not show the empty error bars (shown as a horizontal dash in the data point) while keeping the elements of the DataCurve that do have a value. 
Could you please point out a way how we could achieve this?
 



Has this issue been solved??. I have similar problem. I have created a table in non visual RichEditDocumentServer. When I get the Rtf text from this server (from start of document to end of table), I always with extra paragraph appended at the end. On attempt to to delete the last paragraph even when 
  is set to false  the last paragraph remains. The behaviour doesnot match with the documentation of the devexpress. The last paragraph remains there when the text is empty.
Code snippet:
RichEditDocumentServer richEditServer = new RichEditDocumentServer();
richEditServer.Options.Export.Rtf.ExportFinalParagraphMark = DevExpress.XtraRichEdit.Export.Rtf.ExportFinalParagraphMark.Never;
richEditServer.Document.AppendRtfText(CreateRtfTable());//simple methode which gives rtf string for table
richEditServer.Document.BeginUpdate();
int countPar=richEditServer.Document.Paragraphs.Count; // o.p=18
Paragraph lastParagraph = richEditServer.Document.Paragraphs.Last();
string lastParagraphText = richEditServer.Document.GetText(lastParagraph.Range);
if (lastParagraphText == "")
{
    ParagraphProperties pp = richEditServer.Document.BeginUpdateParagraphs(lastParagraph.Range);
    richEditServer.Document.Delete(lastParagraph.Range);
    richEditServer.Document.EndUpdateParagraphs(pp);
}
richEditServer.Document.EndUpdate();
countPar=richEditServer.Document.Paragraphs.Count; // o.p=18
Somehow I can't get ride of the last paragraph.  

Hi,

Hi,
I used to have a group box control with dozens of radio buttons inside it - Please refer the attached picture. 
Then I have this function that loops over the radio buttons within a given control, and stores in a variable the name of the checked radio button - If one is checked. When no radio button is checked my variable content is set to 
. This method works just fine when the parent control for the radio buttons is a std. group box.
As the number of radio buttons within my original group box grew up, I added a XtraTab control named 
s to my form, and replaced my line of code from this to this
If there is any radio button checked within the parent control, the variable 
 returns the name of the radio button, and my logic takes from there...
I have 3 similar variables to capture possibly active radio buttons across 3 controls, and they?re populated normally when the control type is a group box. When the parent control is a XtraTab control, the variable content is kept as 
 even though a radio button is checked in the XtraTab. Because it is kept as nothing, I?m unable to determine if I have a radio button checked within the XtraTab control...
Below you can see a short version of my function - How can I loop over the radio buttons within a XtraTab control and get the same result I get when I use a std. group box?

hi there.

Dear Support Team,
I am going to use devextreme data grid in MVC project. Why i choose devextreme because i need grid control should be reponsive for any device.
I need some information about like which framework will be good for me to implement it. I have the case also when some of the page millions of record i need to show also.
I already tried Devexpress grid where i used custom data binding and it is loading the record as expected.
The same i need to use here also. Currently using which framework i can able to manage the large data here?
1. Asp.Net MVC 
2. Angular
3. Angular JS. 
Please suggest me on the above.
Thanks,

Hi,
One cell in the grid stores the password when the value of another column on the same row is "UserPasswod". We like to user password mask when displaying password value. 
Is it possible?

I would need to intercept the events of the WEB ReportDesigner menu, for example when saving, when the user presses the Save button or Save As ...
I need to know what client is saving. This is because based on the client I will have to save the report, through ReportStorage, in databases rather than in another.

Hello DevExpress Team,
I use an IIS web service to transfer data from an external application to my XAF database. Therefore, I've got several web methods. One expample for this I post below.
If such a web method is called, two connections to the XAF database are opened. One of there connections I can close, but one remains open, but I don't now, how to close this open connection. Do you know, how I can close these connection?

Hi,
 
I have a TreeListView with a context menu. The content of the context menu is depending on the node type and some other properties.
 
I'm trying to bind the items of the context menu to a property in the view model. It's almost working, with the exception that the context menu starts behaving weirdly when a node without any context menu items is selected. Then the context menu shows up in an unexpected position (see "Context menu with Visibility converter.jpg"). 
This situation appears if you RMB on "Proxy: q2" in the attached project, and then select another node. Then the context menu seems to be "glued" to the position of "Proxy: q2". 
 
It seems this behavior is related to my using a converter to hide the context menu in the case where there are no items. 
Without the converter, the context menu is shown as a small, empty square (see "Context menu without Visibility converter.jpg"). 
 
I've seen that the recommended approach to control the context menu content is to use the ShowGridMenu event on the TreeListView. I'm able to get this approach to work, but it's not very MVVM'ish. 
So, will my binding approach work? Or do I have to depend on the ShowGridMenu event?
Rgds,
Petter Ballandby

Hello
We are using Devexpress mail client application to connect to Inbox we are trying to connect to inboxes. Now when we want to switch between inboxes and load the other mailbox folders we are reloading folder variable in viewmodel, which is fine. But the treeview dosent refresh but only shows up when be minimize the navbar and open it again.  
So as a work around used the below ticket method to close and expand the navbar back. But unfortunately this is also not working. even thou the property changes but the navbar dosent close or open .
With regard to this ticket 
Please advise
Thanks
 

Hi
I am using a DXDialogWindow to show a Login Dialog at application startup.  Whist there are examples of this in the help files and support tickets I have need allow the login to allow some fixed values when the application is run first time and then later on refer to the application's backend database to verify a user's name and password.  So to that extent the login view needs to have a corresponding viewmodel that can take this scenario into account.  I have therefore opted to use  the messenger service to communicate back to the mainViewModel that instantiated the Login Dialog when the login is closed.
The problem I'm currently facing is one of layout.  Firstly I'm using the DataLayout control because I want to make use of its ability to show datavalidation symbols (that works).  I also want to be able to show a simple check or cross image to the side of the User Name and Password Datalayout items that will be shown (with the appropriate image) when the user name and password have been validated.  Only a valid combination will trigger the enablement of the login button.
Before adding the image placeholders into the view the layout (thanks to the datalayout control) worked nicely.  Since adding them it doesn't (see the attached image)
So I have two specific layout questions.  Is my use of stackpanels to try and line up the datalayoutitem and image placeholder correct or is there a better way to do this, or perhaps it can't be done in which case I'll need a rethink.
Secondly, given that dialog is there purely to get the end user to enter their name and password it really only needs the login and cancel buttons to handle closure.  Can I remove the standard min, max and close buttons that form part of the dialog window chrome, and if so how.
Lastly is it possible to use your SvgImageSource magic to place svg images into the plain image control (which I wish to do dynamically from the viewmodel depending on whether the Username and Password pass validation or fail, thus giving the end user a visual clue to correctness or otherwise).
This is the current xaml I have for the view
and for the sake of completeness this is the viewmodel as it stands 
The Login dialog is called from the main viewmodel like so;
Many thanks
Dom

How can I achieve functionality similar to DevAV demo / Empoyees using DevExtreme MVC ?
I would like to display master data in grid , and detail data on several tabs below.
Which controls should I use for organizing the view below the grid? How to template each tab with different grid or different functionality (ie grid on one tab, file upload on another etc) ?

I get the below when a datagrid is refreshed in internet explorer.
There seems to be an issue with the caching of data and I believe the above error may be causing it. Please advice how to deal with the below error.
'jQueryEvent' property is deprecated in 17.2. Use the 'event' field instead 
I also get the below error
 Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: Panel 

Hello 
I have the following problem (web only):
if i open a detail view with multiple Sub- List-Views in which one has an action connected AND the list is filtered AND the view was started on a different tab then the first one, the action does not enable even if the target criteria is true. 
Ways to enable the action:
1. change the filter
2. de-select / re-select all rows
3. refresh the view manually
I have attached a sample project. Please do the following:
1.  start the web project
2. enter a "MainObject"
3. enter a couple of "SubObjects" (only fill in the names)
4. Save
5. Switch to the tab "SubObjects2"
6. Close the MainObject and return to the  MainObject-ListView
7. Open the MainOject you just created in a detail view
8. Since the tab "SubObjects2" is now automatically opened - select the first tab
9. Check all rows with the check box above the list
10. both actions are disabled
11. change the filter
12. Check all rows with the check box above the list
13. one of the actions is enabled
This behaviour is found any time a list is not displayed to begin with and has a filter.
Any ideas?
Regards
Chris

This example demonstrates an edge-case scenario and uses XPO in an uncommon way. Refer to the following articles for XPO best practices:
The approach demonstrated in this example can be used when you need to take advantage of the 
 feature, but cannot use statically declared business models mapped to the database. This approach can be used to support adding/removing database columns without modifying the application code, to implement a generic View consuming data from an arbitrary table (or even database) selected by the user, or to implement a SaaS application.
This example is based on the following technologies:
1. 
 (aka XPO) are used as a data access layer. Refer to the tutorials in our online documentation to get started with XPO: 
.
2. XPO supports dynamic mapping to the database tables without declaring any classes. Refer to this Knowledge Base article to learn more about this functionality: 
.
3. Our 
 component for ASP.NET MVC platform has an API that allows you to populate a grid with data manually taking into account the current grid state (filtering, sorting, grouping) - 
.
4. XPO provides components that can be used to load objects without knowing their types at compile time (
) or building complex queries with grouping, filtering, sorting and data aggregation (
).
Refer to our online documentation to understand concepts used in this example.
 This example extends a standard approach of connecting an ASP.NET application to an XPO data store described in this article: 
. In this scenario, the persistent classes schema can be changed at run time. To address this requirement, it is necessary to create a separate 
 for each user, instead of sharing a single 
 instance between all users as it recommended to do in regular scenarios. Refer to the 
 file for implementation details.
 To handle the concurrent access to a 
, this example uses the DataStorePool component. XPO automatically creates DataStorePool when the connection string contains the special parameter. The 
 method is used to prepare such connection string.
 The GetNewSession and GetNewUnitOfWork methods implemented in the extended XpoHelper class accept an 
 instance as a last parameter. XPDictionary provides metadata information used to map persistent objects to database tables. In the example, the XPDictionary instance is prepared in the 
 file. This implementation is intended for demonstration purposes only. In real projects, it should be replaced with a custom implementation integrated with the application architecture and business requirements.
 The 
 file contains a universal class that can be used in real projects without modifications. It provides the 
 required to calling to a grid view model's 
 method. The usage is demonstrated in the 
 file.
To add this functionality to an existing ASP.NET MVC project, do the following:
 Copy the 
 file to your project. If the project already contains a similar helper class copied from the 
 article, you can replace it or use both the implementations together.
 Add required connection strings to your Web.config file. Refer to the Microsoft documentation to learn more about the 
 configuration section: 
, 
. If the application uses a database other than MS SQL Server, it is necessary to add a special parameter to a connection string. Refer to the following article for details: 
.
 Copy the 
 file to your project.
 Using examples provided in the 
 file and the 
 article, implement a helper class that builds metadata to map persistent objects to specific tables according to your business requirements.
Use the XpoBindingHandler class in your Controllers the same way as it is demonstrated in the 
 file. This class is independent from other parts of the project and can be re-used without modifications.
                            

Hello there
I have an issue with a dockpanel not getting focused when it gets clicked on after leaving an editor who is open in a gridview.
This seems to relate to a setting on the dockmanager : ValidateDockPanelOnDeactivate
If this setting is true, then after the editor closes upon clicking on another dockpanel, the clicked-on dockpanel does not seem to become "focused".
In our application I noticed that the dockpanel actually became active, but it did not look "focused" because the titlebar does not look to be enabled .
Clicking on the dockpanel again caused the "OnActivePanelChanged" on the dockmanager to be fired again (for the same dockpanel).
I created a sample application to demonstrate the issue and also a video, these are attached in a zip.
In the video, I start with this setting turned on and demonstrate that the dockpanels do change their title by clicking between them normally. 
Then the issue is demonstrated where the "dockPanel2 " does not become active after clicking on its titlebar when leaving the editor in the grid in "dockPanel1" (when the editor closes).
I then turn this setting off by commenting out the line in my test-project and run it again where you now can see the desired behaviour.
I want to have this setting enabled but still allow the second dockpanel to appear focused when  leaving an editor, how can I accomplish this?
Cheers

Hi,
I'm using the ToastNotification  for Winforms. It works fine on my PC but is not working for other users after I published the solution using ClickOnce. The notification method is called from a dll whjch is then referenced by the main solution. Here's the code I'm using to create and show the notification.
As a back up the alert control is being used, but I'd prefer to use notifications. All machines are using Windows 10 .
Thanks 

Hi
It's difficult to get overviews in timeline views when there is a lot of "Appointments". Standard views are too "big" so you have to set on scrolling. This is however quite often not desirable.
Is there some kind of best practice for  setting sizes/zooming in/out both horizontally and vertically. 
I have made some scrolling on/off hours on/off and height calculated from count appointments that works, but it's rather primitive.
Another "issue" is multiple appointments on the same row - The row should grow in height in my opinion. 
several appointments on the same rows is displayed as thin lines.
 

Hi
Is there a way to catch a row being added to a WPF grid control?  I have a grid in a user control that gets it's data via the DataContext reference.  Rows are added at runtime  and I need to catch the rows being added so that I can set the cell tooltips (I have to hack the tooltip in like this because using a CellStyle only works in some instances of the grid with no indication of why it doesn't work consistently in all of them and also introduces other bugs, like changing the colour of the cell text to white when right-clicking.  I also tried adding the tooltip text in the MouseMove handler, but that doesn't work properly because when the tooltip is initially null the non-null tooltip is only picked up when the cursor exits and then re-enters the control).
I've tried handling various events - ItemsSourceChanged , SourceUpdated and DataContextChanged - but they're either never fired or only fired before rows are added.
 Thanks

Editing a timespan within DevExpress Gridview today is not supported and requires custom programming for developers.
As DevExpress is useful to improve productivity of software developers I expect it to support this SQL Server datatypes.
Would you please prioritize this and add it to development backlog ?
Can you please provide a workaround for the time being?
We need this working in an ASP.NET MVC Gridview.
Thanks in advance!

Hi

About another post that I wrote recently, I realize a project to reproduce the error, and of course, I can not include in this project phases too heavy. But suddenly I have to deal with a situation that has not happened yet.
Hence the title question of this post: How to make a file missing, used in a datasource, does not cause the stop of the document preview control being created?
an xtrareport.createdocument () statement encapsulates calls to subreports, and if only one of them is corrupted by an error, it prevents all the document from occurring.
Should i call in secret some subreport.reportsource.creadocument to catch error, and redirect subreport.reportsource to a sp?cial ErrorReport substitution ? 

We have either light or dark themes defined against our individual Dashboard Templates. I have now modified our web viewer to use ASPxDashboard, with callbacks and as a result no longer have to refresh the page when changing dashboard.
Unfortunately every attempt i've made to alter the theme is not working, is there any way of doing this programatically? 


We are using your XtraCharts component in conjunction with the data grid component and use the data grid component's export function.
In that database there is a field which represents the time of day in seconds. 
This field is interpreted in the component, so the displayed value has a human readable format (hh:mm:ss). 
Is it possible to use this format when exporting the data via the export function provided by your component?
My guess is we'd have to use either 
 or  
but I have not yet figured out how to do it.

Hi,
how can I make the vertical lines of the indicator column header not visible. I want only the lines of the indicator column header invisible, the vertical lines of the other column headers should stay visible.
Is this possible?
Thanks, Jens 

When a cell in grid has long text value, in filter (Excel type filter) those values are cropped. I need (..) at the end of the text which goes out of the filter box. Attached image for reference.

Hello,
I am puzzled after reading your examples and the responses you have already given to similar question regarding the compatibility of Web API and your HTML 5 Report Viewer so I will be as precise as I can.
We want to build a report, within your MVC Report Designer through a web application communicating with db through EF (which is feasible) and later to expose the data of that particular report through the HMTL 5 Report Viewer from within a second web application communicating front to the client through Web API and back to the db with any other ORM (Dapper, ADO .Net, EF).
Is that possible and how (with a code example)? Could we per say, create the data of the report and export it through a List object from withing the Report Viewer?
 Thank you in advance.

After I upgraded DevExpress Winforms to version 17.2.5. The "Add DevExpress Item" menu item is grayed out within the solution explorer. I can add items for an older version. However, that is not what I want. 
I ran a DevExpress WinForms installer repair
I restarted my Windows PC
I upgraded Visual Studio Community
Please help me out! 


                                This example demonstrates how to use the 
 class to obtain document layout elements located under the specific point and show this information in the ToolTip.
Use the 
 method to get the 
 object providing information about a specific document element which is located under the test point. Retrieve the layout element using the 
 property or obtain the hit information about the element positioned next to the current hit element using the 
 property. After that, display the required information about the document layout element in the ToolTip.

Hi,
I've attached sample solution to show You my problem.
I have  2 the same GridControls with filtered columns - 1st grid have column filter to "Column = Unchecked", 2nd grid have column filter to "Column = Checked". Both of grid are bounded to the same collection from the same object.
I have in both simple InitNewRow procedure that on 1st grid sets column to Unchecked and on the 2nd grid sets column to Checked .
When I want to add record on 1st grid it appers on the 2nd one too - it's not filtered by the GridView conditions.
Try add new record to one of grid in  Sample Solution, which I've attached.
Maybe there is other way to do this binding to make it working correct?

I can't get the two controls (BootstrapTimeEdit and BootstrapDateEdit) to display correctly with Bootstrap 4. I found that the right expandable icon drops to the next row and the calendar grid is not lined up.

I am using master detail grid and I want to set different Detail Descriptor based on row value
Is there any way for this Issue.

Hi,
I have updated my application to v17.2 but getting error for most of the controls. I had raised other tickets also related to this but couldn't fix  the issue, hence raising new ticket by adding sample app to reproduce issues. Open browser console to see js error also press 'Add New Row' button to add new row in grid.
Please verify and let me know the fixes. 

I'm currently about to exchange all old image with SVGs. In my current test i unfortunatly run into a issue which might be the dealbreaker.
Until yet, all graphics on buttons which are set to disabled are grayed out by default. The SVGs have a special value therefor "DisabledSvgImage". In the current project, i roughly included 1000 imagefiles to due the fact, that some customer wanted to have their branding. As you can imagen, it would be a humongous workload to create those SVGs now as grayed version on top of it.
After reading the "How To: Draw and Use SVG Images" i haven't spotted any easy/suitable possebility to have grayed version from SVGs as we are used to have it from all the other images (mostly PNG). Have we just missed the information or is there a plan to add this feature with an upcomming release? (Automatically grayed SVG for disabled buttons).
 

The implemented iconset used in my project also provides with SVGs. They are "drawn" on a "width='1024px' height='1024px'"-page. This leads to the little issue, that my coworker can't easily see what's drawn on it (image attached). Is there a setting to activate that the SVGs are resized to the "SvgImage Picker"-preview-border if the svg is bigger?
 

Hi
I have large GridView with many columns so that it is bigger than the windows size.  My problem with this is that when I scroll to the very right and edit a cell (Scrolling1.png), after hitting the save button it sets the scrollbar position to the very left and very top (Scrolling2.png).
I want that the scrollbar is kept on the same position so that I can continue to work on other columns without scrolling back every time

Hello,
I use the WPF SpreadSheetControl with custom templates (See 
) and have the requirement to have a "Fit to content" (or Autofit) functionality, so the column width is exactly as broad as needed to display all stuff in that column.
I have understand, that the existing AutoFit() functionality is based on text and  cannot support a more complex or dynamic scenario with an "unkown" cell content set through cell template.
Fortunately, the WPF layouting mechanism works perfectly and can measure and layout the items gracefully. I do not want to re-invent this using some workarounds. Instead, the basic idea is to use WPF layouting as base for column width. I am fully aware of the fact, this is only possible if the cell content has already "be transformed into controls", especially it  will only work for cells inside the current view area. But for a best-fit  algo, this should be sufficient and the only chance.
I think this would be a nice feature (maybe also attached behavior) for those which use custom cell teplates.
My problem is, how to get the current WPF representation (Visal Tree, root Visual object) for one cell ? 
I  implemented and illustrated the basic approach using reflection of private dx methods (see attachment), but that's an quirk, unofficial, unsupported way.
Have you any suggestion ?If not, can you check if there is the chance to get a supported way in next release to access the WPF visual tree of a cel l ?. For example, the following method would be perfectly either in SpreadSheet or in View class:
UIElement GetCellVisual(int rowIndex, int cellIndex);
it would be similar to the existing GetCellBounds(). For details, reference to the method attached.

Hi, There seems to be a problem with the document manager showing the tiles when the skin change and the tiles does not fit the form.
To reproduce:
Use attached sample project and run it, click the button with the settings icon and change the skin from the dropdown to "Devexpress Style". Then close the form. The tiles would have been dissapear. They show up if the form is maximized or resized.
Please let me know how can i fix this.

Hi,
we are having a grid with 50+ columns with form edit mode. There is additional logic in editingStart event and customizeItem method. All these together cause a delay of 4s in IE11 for the grid to open the edit form since the click of edit.
I have made loading panel visible in editingStart event, I can see that the command is executed as soon as edit is clicked but the load panel is appearing only after the same lag  duration.
Please suggest how get the loading panel as soon as edit is clicked or any other kind of intimation to the end user that t he grid edit form will be displayed shortly.
Thanks. 

Hi,

Hi, there seems to be a problem with custom appointment form from the scheduler control. I simply created a new project, added a scheduler control, and press "Create custom appointment form". Then i selected "Default". Soon after the form is created the form seems to contain an error.
Here is the code where the error appear:
    Public Overridable Sub SetMenuManager(menuManager As DevExpress.DevExpress.Utils.Menu.IDXMenuManager)
        MenuManagerUtils.SetMenuManager(Controls, menuManager)
        Me.m_menuManager = menuManager
    End Sub
Seems to be something with "DevExpress.DevExpress.Utils.Menu.IDXMenuManager"
I have attached a sample project.


Hi,
Can you please give the solution for the second screenshot (Untitled.png) also. We are trying to get the Group field value to the footer.

Hello
I have a devexpress gridview and i have several bool fields in the datasource.
Now i want to display icons instead of the checkbox.
If the bool is true i want a green tick (apply icon) and if the boolean is false i want to display the red cross in the cell.
Can i achieve this approach using the gridview's format rules?
If not, how to?
Thank you!
Best regards!

We also have problems with other documents. For some only the first 4 or 5 pages are renderd. We didn't find a pattern.
If I open one problematic document and save it back to disk, the editor saves the hole content in the new file. 
So the content exist in the editor's internal structure but for some reasons it doesn't render all the content in page.
I also made a sample with an empty WebForms Project that contains an AspxRichEdit editor.
Thank you an I look forward for a solution,
Robert

Hi!
I don't know why in one cliente, show this error attach, and I found in this SEMESTER routine.. if I comment code, not show this error more..
looking for "internal_semester", in 3 points of code..

Hello, i am actually building a view with a dx-autocomplete, dx-select-box and two dx-date-boxes, i've set the autocomplete and the select box
with width=300, it perfectly worked, but the date boxes don't change their current width, i've seen some tickets with similar trouble but none 
of the proposed solutions worked for me, and when the width changes, the box is dragged to the left side of the screen, covering it's labels.
The code for the date-boxes (built as an Angular shared component) :
   <div class="dx-field-value">
      <dx-date-box
      name="data"
      [min]="minDate"
      [max]="maxDate"
      [showClearButton]="true"
      dateSerializationFormat="MM/dd/yyyy"
      placeholder="Selecione uma data"
      [(ngModel)]="value"
      ngModel>
    </dx-date-box>
  </div>
The code where it is being called (with it's tag defined in his component.ts) :
<div class="geo-content__row geo-row--title">
  <form #cicloAno="ngForm">
    <div class="dx-fieldset">
      <div class="dx-field">
        <div class="dx-field-label">Data de ?nicio:</div>
        <app-ciclo-data name="ciclo_inicio" [(ngModel)]="data_incial" [maxDate]="data_final"></app-ciclo-data>
      </div>
      
      <div class="dx-field">
        <div class="dx-field-label">Data Final:</div>
        <app-ciclo-data name="ciclo_final" [(ngModel)]="data_final" [minDate]="data_incial"></app-ciclo-data>
      </div>
    </div>
  </form>
</div>
How can i set the width of this component ? Can i set it inline for this case ?

Hello,
I have a WinUIDialog in our application for which  I defined a WinUIDialogService with a template within the Interaction.Behaviors and call it in our view model as intended.
However, we also need some notifications in our application (like a loading screen when importing files) . These are supposed to look like the WinUIDialog but I'm unable to get it to work.
1. The Dialog has to be closed automatically without user interaction after the import is complete, which the WinUIDialog does not seem to offer.
 2. I tried to use a WinUIMessageBoxService instead but this does not offer the definition of a template.
3.  I tried to find out how to use a WinUIMessageBox without the service, which does have a template property, but I couldn't find any hint on it whatsoever.
4. I tried to use the MVVM notification service, which offers a template but couldn't get it to look like anything close to the WinUIDialog. It doesn't even stretch across the screen but solely resides in the top right corner of the application.
 So, how can I get a notification looking like a dialog that gets closed automatically? I can't believe the MessageBoxService is so inherently different to the DialogService that it doesn't even offer a template.

I have expanded a previous example zip with a new problem. 
When a textbox is decorated with WaitForValidValue validation mode, I cannot leave the control anymore. 
However, the cancel button (which resets the form to initial values) should be clickable.
How can this be done?

Hello we have the following issue:
We are trying to manage the enability of various button on the ribbon of the spreadsheet, particularly the copy, cut and paste buttons.
To do so we binded the IsEnabled property to our own value but it seems like our binding is not taken into consideration and is overriden inside the frameworks.
Is it possible to manage the enability of the different ribbon item ?
If so what did we missed in our binding to manage it properly ?
Here is an example of our bindings:
<dxb:UpdateAction ElementName="{x:Static dxsps:DefaultBarItemNames.RibbonItem_Home_Clipboard_Cut}" PropertyName="IsEnabled" Value="{Binding IsCopyPasteEnabled, Mode=TwoWay}" />

Hallo, dear DevExpress support,
in our software we have a window with a gridcontrol and a chartcontrol placed below.
Depending on the selected row in the gridcontrol (and the data behind) the chartcontrol is switched visible/invisible.
Now i have to implement the print preview, for this window, the gridcontrol and the chart should be placed on one page (A4, landscape) !
In addition i have to add some header/footer information ... (title, company name, date, time, ...)
I did not found any examples how to combine several Components in one common print peview.
Could you please create a simple example or do you have a link for this problem ?
Thanks and best regards

                                The PDF Viewer has several types of popup menus that can be invoked by an end-user for bookmark options, bookmark tree, page content, a thumbnail, and thumbnail options. 
This example shows how to hide the popup menu for the bookmark tree and remove specific items from the page content popup menu.
To customize items of the PDF Viewer's popup menu, handle the 
 event. This event fires every time an end-user opens a popup menu in the PDF Viewer. 
Each popup menu type has a unique set of bar items that are located in the bar item link collection. To access a bar item link collection, check the popup menu type using the 
 property and use the 
 property.
To hide a popup menu, clear all items from the bar item link collection. 
To remove an item from the popup menu, find the item by the caption in the bar item link collection and then remove it.

Please see the attachment.

I'm trying to print PDF files but without any margins as the PDFs already have margins embedded in them.
If I set the margins to zero they  seem to get reset back to some default value. The only way I can do it is to set a very small value in which it does work but I'd prefer zero.
Is there any way of doing this?
Thanks 

Hello,

the wrong event to add controls to the item?

Hi,
You provided ability to reference cells from another sheet by manually adding sheet name and exclamation mark '!' but it is very inconvenient and error-prone.  Microsoft Excel provides a way to point a cell from another sheet by start typing formula with '=' and then switch to required sheet and just select the cell. I can't do same in Devexpress spreadsheet. Is it by design or am I missing something? How can it be achieved (even with some code)?
thanks

I am looking for a Container control for my Ribbon form that will allow me to eliminate my Tab Control, put all controls at the front and permit the user to just scroll vertically or horizontally (like a webpage).
Do you have any suggestions for this?
[UPDATED]
I have found the XtraScrollableControl.  That is exactly what I was looking for.
Now to complement this control is the a Collapsible group control (sort of like the Navigation Bar control that will allow me to have flexible sections of my screen?  This control would go inside of the xtrascroll control and add some sectional depth to my screen.
Or could I just use the AccordianControl and get best of both worlds?

Hi,
  We want to change the Header color in GridViewDashboardItem, so using below Class name we changed the color in Css. It is working good.

I need to drag a node from one parent to another.   
For example, in the top part of PictureOne - attache d, I need to move the item at 1. to the position at 2.  At the same time I need to change the data values of these items so that the drag-and-drop is represented in the database.
That is the problem.  When I make no data changes, the TreeListControl does its thing and the UI looks great - the drag-n-drop is represented as expected.  Of course when I close the app and open it again the changes have not been persisted.
When I make the data changes in the DropRecord event, the UI looks like the bottom half of the attached image - PictureOne.  It displays that two items have been dragged to the new parent.  The changes are persisted to the database correctly, and when I close the app and re-open it, the results of the drag-and-drop are displayed as expected.
NOTES:  
 - the parent and child items in the Tree are different things.  They are not the same things, with different values - they are not all Employees like most of the sample code. 
 - I am using Entity Framework as the model for the app.
 - Idea: can I turn off DevExpress' handling of the Drop and let my code and Entity Framework handle that?   However, I love the target pointer thing that tells the use where they are dropping the item.  : - )   If I have to I can do without it. 
Thanks 

Hi Team,
Could you please help me understand, what's the actual difference between CustomSummary and CustomCellValue events?
I understand that  CustomCellValue is executed for every cell and it goes after the summary calculation.
What is the proper usage of those?
If I want to calculate custom summary I can actually do it in CustomCellValue event handler, then what's the profit of having CustomSummary? 
Thanks in advance!

Hi DevExpress,
after chrome update to version 64.0.3282.119, we noticed strange rendering issue (blinking) in grid control. You can see it in attached video. We are using Moderno theme in our project.
Do you have an idea how to fix it?
Kind regards

I need to apply a custom validation to the PivotGrid unbound expressions when using the new intellisense-like editor.
This customized validation approach was provided by you recently in another ticket created by me, regarding the GridControl:
I missed this event when applying such workaround in the PivotGridControl.
Could you please consider adding this event?
PS: Not urgent, since we can roll back  to the legacy editor by now.

Hi
Im receiving an  error "Cannot read property 'radius' of undefined" if i generate a PieChart without any fields or datasource connected to it (I want to generate it on beforehand and then wait for the user to make a connection for it).
I also receive the same error if I rebind both the datasource and fields at the same time (or the fields slightly before). 
This is because I don't use the same but with another source, I switch out both the bound fields and then "wait" for a new source.
The error is located at the following position (given from console error message):
return p.getSizeGroupLayout().radius at eval (pie_chart.js:349)

Hi,
I read below thread and works for me too but I have a quick question,  is there an easy way to keep some datafields(columns) of the same value as previously added row, our client doesn't want to re-enter again, but to change only what is needed.
This is the thread I used;
 
Let me know if someone can suggest.
Thanks,

Hallo,
 after upgrading DevExtreme to Version 17.2.5, the IOS App icons are no longer working.
I found this KB article: 
According to this article, this bug was resolved in 17.1.3. I did skip some versions when upgrading. I think I came from  16.2.*, not sure though.
the problem is the same as described in the KB: The icon is just a white, blank image.  
Strangely, forcing an old phonegap-cli version as suggested in the KB, did not help:
If I unpack the *.ipa file, I see my icons in the folder payload/appName. In the subfolder payload/appName/www/res I can see all the empty images. Seems like the files are not correctly copied when built. I build with VisualStudio "Build native package" .
Is there a fix for this? Maybe define the icon path manually?

Hello. 
How can i get Html string from richedit control? 
Control has only two methods for getting text. GetText and GetRtfText, but i need Html string.

I tried to do it for c++:
#include "dxRichEdit.Html.hpp"
but i have a linker error. Screenshot of error in attachment

Hi
When binding data to my dxChart I first simulate X- and Y-axis by binding the same given field for my datasource on both my argument and value axis.
By doing it this way, I can visualize one bar taking for my measure.
But, when I then bind a different argument (to my new datasource), my y-axis is not redrawn. Therefor, my new values will look extremely  tiny.
I believe  that this is because my value key has never changed it's name from my first binding.
I'm binding to my dxChart using normal array objects, inside of Angular (IO v5).
Any idea on what my cause this problem?
I thing this might me related to the same error as I am experiencing.

Hi,
Is it possible to change the "Connection Name" for a SqlDatasource in the Report Designer? (see screenshot below)
I was used to acess and change this value direct in the .repx file with version 16.2.3:
            // 
            // sqlDataSource
            // 
            this.sqlDataSource.ConnectionName = "DataPlaygroundCustomConnection";
but now, as of 17.2.4, it seems that this value is encrypted within the .repx and I'd like to change this values from the designer.
Thanks in advance,

Hello,
I downloaded yesterday the 30day trial.
I wanted to make  a prove of concept for an easy (sales) dashboard  to compare it with  some visualisation components of a other software company.
Our  external developer advised to use telerik, but since I had some nice experience with Devexpres in the past i wanted to test this software  first.
(I will have the final choose)
When I launch the Sales  Dashboard from the DevExtreme Demo its works, but when I open the  solution in visual studio en run it, the data will not load. Al the  screens say Loading.... (you can fiend a screenshot attached)
Is there something I can check or do to solve this problem?
I'm very new to this part and have no idea where to start looking.
Hopefully you can provide me some help to this problem.
Best regards,
Tom

Hello, 
On a XAF View we have a functionality for the user to save, retrieve and apply custom filters to and from a database. 
Now I want to transfer this functionality to a web application (Anagular 5, to be precise). 
I've seen some inconsistencies between the filter string of the XAF data grid and the Devextreme one. 
Specifically, the currently saved filters have the following format: 
[ColumnName!] = ##XpoObject#Name.Space.To.Entity(ID)# And [ColumnName!] = ##XpoObject#Name.Space.To.Entity(1)# 
Which comes directly from the GridView.ActiveFilterString property. 
On the web app however, calling dataGrid.instance.getCombinedFIlter(true)  returns an json-like format:
ColumnName,contains,Value,and,ColumnName,contains,Value
Is there a way  of conversion between these two formats or do I have to do it manually?
Thanks in advance. 

Dear Sir / Madam,
When you are using a dxDateBox in IE and click on the datetimepicker to open a window it works fine. Then you have to close the datetimepicker and click again at the datetimepicker. The datetimepicker is shown and is  2x as big as its normal state. When you click for a third time on the datetimepicker it will be huge.
In the attachment I paste my image to show my issue.
Is it possible to reproduce this is issue or is a fix available for this problem?
Thank you in advance!
Kind regards,
Jelle 

Hi,
I have a problem  with a TileView; my tile should show an image in a 100x100 pixel size, but instead just a small part of the picture is shown. I have set width, repository item settings, image size in tile layout... I attach the result, see lower part of the form.
Thanks for your help

Hi
When hovering some piece of a chart or piechart, you get indicator lines on Chrome and Firefox (together with transparency), but not on Safari, it just turns completely transparent for dxPieCharts instead, no indication at all for dxCharts (just the same solid color as selected).
Same goes for IOS devices (like an iPhone or iPad).
Also, the tooltip property does not look the same. In chrome (both desktop and android) the tooltip will receive a white box with an arrow, but on Safari (both Mac and iPhone) you only get the plain text (and nothing else).
// Erik 

If you have a Report with a datasource that uses the "DisplayName" attribute, it can make the the new expression binding lookup go wrong.
For Example our datasource is something like:
public class SomeDatasource
{ 
    [DisplayName("Report Data")
    public ReportData ReportData {get; set;}
} 
If you try to drag on the field in the designer from the Field List it will work ([ReportData].[SomeField]).  But if you hit the smart tag of a label and try to set it to an expression it will be set wrong and not work ([Report Data].[SomeField]). Same happens if you use the Expression Editor. 

I use SaveLayoutToXml and RestoreLayoutFromXml from TabbedView.
It works fine, but how can I reset the TabbedView if it fails? If the user modifies the xml-file...
If RestoreLayoutFromXml throws an exception I can?t add documents anymore. (The return value of TabbedView.AddDocument is null) 
How can I reset the TabbedView to avoid this?
TabbedView.Controller.ResetLayout is not the solution.
I modified a sample project and made a video.

Hi
When trying to touch a data visualization control to view the given tooltip, or using dxPivotGridFieldChooser to drag-n-drop fields for binding data to a dxPivotGrid, none of the touch events gets fired.
This is true for all Android devices  running Firefox (tested in newest version 58).
But, this does work as expected on IOS devices and  desktop version of Firefox (also version 58).

Hi,
I am trying to do spell check on fields with same IDs and different containers , when I do spell check on the second field, it actually does on the first one. 
The scenario is : 
1. I click on a field say 
in <div> 
and then I click on spell check button. It does spell check correctly
2. Now I click on a different field 
with same ID but different <div> container say 
.
3. But now the spell check is done again on the same field 
I tried  both CheckElement( element ) and CheckElementById( elementId ). (There is no way I could change the ID of the fields as they are used throughout the application in the same way.)
What are the other options available to fix this issue?

I've seen other people ask this question and the response is usually to modify the PropertyGridControl.DefaultEditors in order to associate different editors with certain data types. However, this isn't a solution in my case.

How else can I configure this?

Good morning.
We'd like to check if a TcxRichEdit control value has changed whenever the user exits. For our TcxMemo we compare EditValue to EditingValue and that works just fine. But when we do a similar comparison for TcxRichEdit we always get a mismatch because one of the two has RTF values in it. 
We need that comparison because the OnChange function fires all the time and we need to distinguish a true change from a repainting or some other action.
Could you tell us what the proper comparison is to ascertain equality?
Thanks!

We're trying to achieve the following: By some action the user inserts a RTF document containing a hyperlink. We set the selection of the document to the range of the hyperlink. This works fine but when the user starts typing the caret is somehow moved to the end of the document. We wouldn't expect this. Can you help us?

Note that this only happens for certain file extensions, like "xlsx".  If you use "xlsx2", the file will successfully save as "document.xlsx2.png".
Ideally the user can call the file whatever they want without issue, but at the very least this should be a messagebox telling the user the issue rather than an unhandled exception.

Hi,  
Good morning, I have a big problem and I can not find a way to solve it, I had created a solution with an ASPxPivotGrid control which has an UpdatePanel and the ScriptManager; when it was done with version 14.1.6 everything worked correctly the project was updated to version 17.1.4 and now it can not be pivoted or filtered because it generates the error attached to the image. 
It was necessary to update to this version because scroll is needed both horizontally and vertically of the above described control and version 14 does not have this property, now I see myself at the crossroads of why this error is generated and I have a ScriptManager at the beginning of the page and two UpdatePanel, but I do not know why it says that one of them is not registered  
Thanks for your timely help.

Hi, 
I have a grid with a DateTime column.
I need the "UseMaskBehavoir " attribute to be set to true beacuse i would like to don't make the user digit directly slashes
But if  "UseMaskBehavoir " attribute is set to true, when i leave the cell after deleting the value (by keyboard or clear-button) the text displayed remains 01/01/0100 instead of blank.
There's a way to display nothing instead of  01/01/0100 when the field is cleared ?
Please correct my attached example.
Thanks  a lot

    </userSettings>
This applys the theme to all windows for me without having to specify in each window.
I made a new theme.  "N8Dark" .  I pulled it into resources.  .DLL
When I change the name from VS2017Dark to N8Dark, the theme does not apply anywhere and goes to the default colors.  
2. how can i set themeng for groups.  So if group 1 then VS2017Dark. Group 2 is N8Dark  Group 3 is VS2107Light etc.
Please help. 

We have a custom dialog form with a TcxMemo on it to control the display of a message. The form populates the memo box with the message and then sets the Properties.VisibleLineCount according to how many lines of the memo contains and then adjusts the form height accordingly. 
We are currently on v15.1.3 of the VCL controls but moving towards upgrading to v17.2.4 where this problem arises. 
I have attached a compressed file that contains 2 small sample applications to demonstrate this issue in both version of the components. The TcxMemo-DevEx15.1.3 folder contains a project that compiles with v15.1.3 and shows how the form works as we expect and the TcxMemo-DevEx17.2.4 folder contains a project that compiles with v17.2.4 and shows how the form no longer adjusts it's height because of this issue.

I receive an uncontrollable exception when a spin edit value (in a grid control) value is cleared.
In the attached archive file there is a test project demonstrating the issue. It contains also a video showing the exception. here it goes:
I ensure all .NET exceptions are set (turn off and turn on  run time exception in VS)
Activate the test project
In the test project there is grid control bound to a list of object. One column bound to double value which is editable through a spin edit control
 The spin edit is configured with a regular expression
When the application is active, I can enter  a new value in the spin editor.
But if I clear the value (null or empty string?), I get an exception. There are two cases in the video: first I clear the value with delete after selecting the whole value. In the second case just deleted the last digit  in the number, one after the other. After deleting the final (most significant) digit, got the same exception (talking about DateTime value)
I say uncontrollable exception as I couldn't find any event I can get before the exception is fired.
After the exception the application continues, and if I turn off break on the exception, I don't even notice it.
If I comment out the spin edit mask setting by regular expression in the code, there is no exception . Any idea?
/* BTW, I try to setup a regular expression, in order to control the number of digits after the decimal point - some double values might represent unit based values (length, speed  etc), and these have different magnitudes under metric and imperial unit systems; controlling number sign - in a 3D application, distance can be negative as it refers to a certain 'center of the universe' marked as the 0,0,0 point. If you have a better solution as regular expression, I will be more than happy to use it */

OK - so where evaluating the New CodeRush (we previously bought some licenses for the Classic but now we evaulating whether we should buy for the whole team.)
Organize Members : 
We currently use CodeMaid to reorganize our code - it works - it puts everything in regions the way we want - there are a few issues with spacing but nothing major. 
If we purchase your product we hope to load one less tool and use your "Organize Members" but when I invoke that function something happens but it is not what I want. Code elements are not moved together (a public method  at the top of the file is still there and not moved to the region where all the other public methods are.)  The order of the elements does not match the order established in the "Editor\All Languages\Organize Members" and I do not see an "Editor\Visual Basic\Organize Members" section. Is this function broken?
Code Issues:
I don't see the same range of issues that CodeRush classic was able to report.  (I like what I see and it is certainly much less of a resource burden.) It does seem from the documentation that the tool might be open to including 3rd party and self-authored Static Analyzers in the future. Is this true? Is there (or will there be) a defined way to add analyzers to the cataloging of Code Issues?  Also, will the analyzers available in Classic be added to the current version?
 My dream issue would be the identification of "Late Binding calls" - been a while since I fiddled with Roslyn but it would seem like it should be able to identify late-binding calls. Is that possible? (Obviously, my code is a absolute mess and anything that would help clean it up would be greatly appreciated.) Just a thought.
You are really the only people who take the problems of VB developer seriously (and tho we'd all love not to be VB developers it looks like that road will be closed if we can't use a tool like yours to get over some immediate hurdles.)
Thanks, Charles C. Poston
 

Hello,
Is there a way to donwload localized ressources for the version 17.2.
I need the french version.
Thanks

Hi, 
we are using AccordionControl as menu item repository.
As you could see in attached screen shot, red circle is on all child element item.
"Tabelle Calendario" is a child of "Tabelle", it's clear because it has a 5 mm indent, "Application Audit Info" is child of "Visualizza" but it has not got indentation.
Could we indent child item in order to have facility in comprehension which is the group and which is the element item?
Thank you

Hi There,
Can the ASPxFileUpload control use the  Shared Access Signature (SAS) URIs in Azure Storage Accounts (rather than the top-level keys?)
Cheers
Jason. 

Our web application runs as an Azure web app. The following start-up code worked reliably in 17.2.4 but raises an exception in 17.2.5. As a result the print preview action on in-place reports no longer works.
Please advise.

Hello!
I'm working with the DataGrid and the visual components seem to perform really well(using Begin- and EndDataUpdate() on the view). However we have some operations to transform large 2-dimensional arrays(column count is variable). So I'm looking for the fastest way from triggering the operation until the transformed data is displayed. My main question is, if I can bind a column to a certain index of a List or Array or any suggestion or if that is not possible, what are the fastest Datatypes(for manipulating all entries) that I can bind my column to.
Here is what I tried(in chronological order):
1: System.Data.DataTable as DataSource. 
    The binding was easy, but to manipulate all entries of a DataTable is ridiciulously slow.
2: BindingList<BindingList<string>> or similar as DataSource.
    manipulating all entries of this Datatype would be fast. But I couldn't get the binding to work.(string will not be the final Type for the cell value) - Is something like that even possible?
3: BindingList<ExpandoObject> as DataSource.
    Binding works, and a lot faster than DataTable, but also about 6 times slower than the BindingList<BindingList<string>>
I still have to try BindingList with some static object that holds enough properties to fit my row data into. Probably this is a lot faster than the ExpandoObject, but I would like to avoid this approach.

Just updated to 17.2.5 and we are unable to rename our layout panes.  We enter rename mode, type a new name and hit enter and nothing happens.  In 17.2.4 it accepts the new name and works.

Hello,
We have a dynamic list of views in a Prism region, of which each contains a single chart. When the user zooms or scrolls one chart, the other charts are supposed to zoom and scroll equally.
 I have found 
 related question but it uses code behind and as we use Prism's MVVM I do want to bind either the min and max value of the visual range (which is not possible as they don't exist in AxisX2D.VisualRange and are inaccessible in AxisX2D.ActualVisualRange) to properties or bind a change in the zoom/scroll level to a command (which is not possible as the chart control does not offer a zoom/scroll event) or anything else excluding the code behind and including the view model. In both cases an event passed to the event aggregator could be caught by all the other charts, which then adjust their own visual range accordingly.
But as said, I don't know how to get this to work as I'm blocked out of the control in critical parts or it's lacking the possiblity.  How may I achieve this?

I have a MDI- Child Ribbon form which has a AccordionControl set to Dock=Fill.  In my IDE Designer I have the AccordionControl Expanded.
As you can see in the provided video When I first load my screen the AccordionControl is not visible nor does it seem to be rendered.  Then If I resize my form the Accordion shows up and behaves as desired.
Is there a setting I am missing or is this a glitch/bug?

Hi,
I have the following problem :
I have a tcxdbgrid with a tag field (a calculated field) .
When the user tag a row we call the refresh method in order to invoke the "onCalcFields" so that we can display the check simbol on the "tag field"  but we get an access violation.
 

The following start-up code worked well for us in 17.2.4 to establish consistent sizing, placement, and layout for our pop-up windows. The 17.2.5 update does not respect these defaults.  Lookup dialogs have reverted to small, centered windows with action buttons at the bottom of the frame.  We need all pop-ups to use 100% of the available height, 80% of the available width, slide in from the right edge, and have action buttons at the top.
 Please advise.

Hi.
In combo box i have 1015PH value, user want to input 1015P  only. 
It is possible to make this with autocomplete=true?
Space after 1015P and then trim in view model, not a good idea...
 

Hello
I have a main form that contains main menu and I have subform and it contains submenu,
I'm using TabbedMdiManager for both forms, but I couldn't open the subform it gives me an error on " frm.MdiParent = this; "
I'm using this code to open the forms
            Form1 frm = Application.OpenForms["Form1"] as Form1;

I have attached a zip file containing two screenshots of the same code, one at 100% resolution scale and one at 150% scale. The grid control is inside a LayoutControl parent with the UseParentAutoScaleFactor set to True.  At 100% resolution, all the column header captions are clearly visible and there are two cards side-by-side in the details region of each row. At 150% resolution, the column header captions of the narrower columns are obscured and only one card appears in the details region. 
Should the UseParentAutoScaleFactor resolve these scaling issues? Or must they be resolved with code? What is the best approach for resolving these scaling issues? 

Hi, I'm using Sort by colums, save the layoutstring, but when I restore the layoutstring the column comes sorted but without the image in the column as can be seen in the attached image 1.

Hello there,
 I am using the dashboard designer,  and creating/ saving  "dashboard".xml  files.
Now, When I open an  file  ( "dashboard.xml") from the designer,  I want to inspect the datasources used by that particular "dashboard.xml" file , and possible replace it by  another one  . (  I understand that the new  datasource has to contain the same queries/structure.  It does, actually the reason why I have to replace it is because it has more queries that  I need to make available to use in the dashboard.xml file.
any ideas how to accomplish this? Hopefully I was able to explain what  I am trying to do.
Thanks!
 

I have a a chart control bound to the selection of a pivot grid control. The pivot grid control can contain any number of data points. I am getting an out of memory exception on the chart control when i change the selection just a few times on the pivot grid control. My pivot grid control contains only 4 points in this instance. The delay in updating the chart control is set to 300 mili seconds and RefreshDataOnRepaint is set to false.
How is there an out of memory exception on 4 data points on only a few clicks. 
Please see a screen shot attached.

Hi I've spent the whole night trying to make this work.
Is this requirement possible? and how can I implement it? I already read several posts and I couldn't see the same requirement as I have in the forums.
Here's the screenshot of my work,  first the GridControl was displaying all of the data.
The main usage  GridLookUpEdit is to show the list of users who are not yet added on my table, let's call this "BlacklistTable" In other words, if they're already in the BlacklistTable, they will no longer appear in my  GridLookUpEdit.
Then I modified the Username column property: ColumnEdit to use GridLookUpEdit, and the Username column doesn't display the values anymore. I think it's because of the datasource of GridLookUpEdit.
Can you guys help me with this? 
Thanks,
Josh

Hi DevEx-team, I am converting a large WinForms-solution to WPF-MVVM and I would need to declare items in the VerticalRowsCollection to be shown as CategoryRows (which don't display any data cells, just used to arrange shown data into groups) 'cause we made extensive use of this feature in our WinForms-solution. Are you in position to extend this example suchlike or to show any other way how to achieve such an appearance?

Hi, 
I host a WPF diagram control inside a Winforms application. 
The problem I encountered is related to the right click event and the way is fired. When I want to perform a right click for accessing the context menu, I have to click twice in order to display it. This does not happen when the application is not hosted in Winforms . 
Please take a look at the sample application, where you can check the behaviour in Winforms.
Also, I attached a video that demonstrates the issue: I set the mouse over each diagram item and I click the right mouse button: for half of them the context menu is not displayed.
Thanks,

I would like to determine whether an InvoiceDate falls within a specific financial period. The financial period has a StartDate and a EndDate.
How do I filter the table to determine the correct record in VB?
I've tried the following but it only returns nothing:
 Dim obj As CustomerStatementPeriod = Session.FindObject(Of CustomerStatementPeriod)(CriteriaOperator.Parse("StartDate <= ? AND EndDate >= ? ", InvoiceDate, InvoiceDate)
                     
 

I need to change the button text (pass from English to Portuguese). Since I can not change DLLs yet from my project I need to do this manually. Currently I already do this but with the buttons of the XtraMessageBox, like:
public override string GetLocalizedString (StringId id)
         {
             if (id == StringId.XtraMessageBoxYesButtonText)
                 return "Sim";
             if (id == StringId.XtraMessageBoxNoButtonText)
                 return "N?o";
             if (id == StringId.XtraMessageBoxCancelButtonText)
                 return "Cancelar";
             return base.GetLocalizedString (id);
         }
How can I change the text of the DevExpress.XtraPdfViewer.Bars.PdfFilePrintBarItem?
Instead of showing print I need to translate to "imprimir", and if possible even translate the print window that opens in the action.

Hello,
 next to the chart showing a LineSeries2D we need to show a visual representation of additional data, that is the mean value and standard deviation (as seen in the added image).
I thought about adding a second chart  with a RangedBarOverlappedSeries2D, whose top and bottom values define the standard deviation and an additional bar without height atop of it showing the mean value. However, this requires synchronization of the y-Axis of both charts, which worked unreliably at best in an initial test binding lower and upper limits to a view model and transferring changes to the additional chart upon drawing new lines onto the initial chart, thus changing the min and max values of its y-axis.
Now, I wonder, is this the way to go or does the diagram offer  a better fitting functionality I'm not aware of?

Could you please explain how I can make the BootstrapUploadControl a required field.  Please also provide a code sample.  ty

Hi,
I am working on a project, where in we are using the DiagramControl to plot wiring connections. I am placing components by code, to make the diagrams neat.
I want to set the connections type & connection points of a DiagramImage or item as shown in the image attached.
Able to make the connections straight or right angle, but what can be done to make them follow right-angle & some other angle as well, to have a shortest path & neat connection.

Hello,
I have an MVVM, Windows UI, Scaffolded Applcation with two entities:  Parents and Chidren.  There is a One to many relationship from Parents to Children.  I wish to edit the children entities in the same View as the parent fields, instead of editing each child separately. The scaffold generates a Grid for the children in the parent view, but you have to switch views to the child view in order to edit each child.  I hope this makes sense.  I have uploaded a simple app to show you my starting point.
Thanks,

                                This example creates a PopupMenu with three items and binds this menu to the form. You can right-click the form at runtime to invoke the menu.
                            

My treelist does not admit 100% width of the container. I need it to assume the size of the LayoutGroup.

I am having trouble clicking on the master column which scrolls way below the window and then scrolling up to a detail query that has only a handful of columns. Is there a way to set the relationship differently? I tried to click on the master column and hold the control key and then scroll up to the detail column but that does not appear to work. 

I have CustomNodeFilter that works more or less according to design:
with FilterMode="Extended" 




If a level 0 node is showing then all its children are showing.  This is the behavio I want for the first column but no other. See the the attached image. You can see its not wha tis desired in a different column.
How can restrict the conditions in the CUstomNodeFIlter to a single column?  I have a feeling this isn't the right spot.

We are trying to implement a custom data source for our dxScheduler and are having a problem with the start and end date filtering for recurring events. This can be reproduced based on the recurring appointments demo here 
.
If you look at my CodePen, you'll see the issue. I'm trying to filter using the following:
CodePen: 
When this code is implemented no events are returned. This is because the row in data has a start and end date based on the first occurrence of the appointment. How do I modify this so that I can choose some month/date after the first occurrence and return those appointments (without returning all appointments that are recurrences)?
 

How can I have the AccordionControl automatically scroll so that as the user tabs through the various Editors in the various Accordion Groups the Focused control is visible on the screen?

I have a client who runs in a high OLTP environment with an XAF Windows program.  There are also some batch updates/inserts going on with the same set of persistent objects.  Needless to say, we run into some concurrency issues with this, even though we've made efforts to minimize the time between reading/updating objects in the database.  I would like to implement some type of try/catch with a retry of  up to 3 times to re-read and update any failed commits.
Here is the basic structure I have:
So I want to do a try/catch, reload from db and retry the operation like this:
However, I'm not sure what FindObject will actually do.  Will it for sure fetch the current data from the database if someone else has changed it?  What about the ServiceObjectsBillings collection?  Will the previous .Add be thrown out?  Do I need to rollback or anything in the catch?

We are having a design problem getting a Color editor in our grids.
We have requested many things about our grid system in the past. Ultimately all of the columns are auto-generated using pre-determined configuration view models. Even the "Field Name" is bound using a PropertyName so we never even know where the value sits in the RowData.
Our template for Color type columns is as follows:
We need all of the various parts in order to satisfy many different parts of the grid, from Auto Filter Rows, to NULL values, to all of the visual configurations of a column.
The view models for the Column configurations has no connection to the data.
Right now the problem is that we store all Colors as STRING, we cannot and will not be able to store them as System.Windows.Media.Color objects. So we are getting errors, The FieldName is going to have a binding to PropertyName, and that is the name where the color is found.
We do not see anywhere we can add a Converter to get in between the value and the color string converter we wrote.
This is because we have to use the PopupColorEditSetting class which doesn't give a converter for the actual VALUE that will be pumped out, and the GridColumn doesn't provide a place to convert the value that the editor creates into something the cell will get.
We cannot use the "Binding" instead of "FieldName" because we do not know the property name where the color sits in the Row Data at design time.
The DisplayMemberBinding doesn't help again because we dot not have the name of the field at design time.
We do not use any code-behind its full MVVM pattern and templating. So we do not create bindings manually or update bindings at runtime.
We would certainly appreciate some assistance with this topic.
NOTE: It would have been easier if the actual PopupColorEditSetting class knew how to have its value operate as a string instead of a Color object. That would have made all of this moot.
 

I would like to add Grouped date filter to pivot grid with including option with null able selection for date. Our database have date fields that are optional and I need to filter records that does not have date specified. Is there an easy way to do that. I don't want to do anything out of box like custom popup or so on. Please give me an advice. 
I will be using GroupFilterMode="Tree" so the Year Querter Month are grouped together as a tree. Users like that functionality. In my case I can't use CustomFilterPopupItems event handler to update a filter list because it is group filtering not a field filtering.
 



2. how can i set themeng for groups.  So if group 1 then VS2017Dark. Group 2 is N8Dark  Group 3 is VS2107Light etc.
Please help.

Hi, I would like to be able to connect my wpf project to 2 different data sources (production and test SQL). I have followed a method suggested:
 This works in general for my.project I can select at startup which datasource I would like to connect to, and that is fine. My project basically has a MainWindow and a load of flip views and items, and the chosen datasource is respected OK.
The problem I have are the xreports. I assume that because these are not part of mainwindow, then the code I have does not apply.
I am able to specify at runtime which data source the reports should use  by using the below code when calling the report:
This works fine, but I need to use in all xreports I use. Is there a better way to implement the selected datasource which would apply to all reports?
Many thanks

Is there similar functionality to Grid View MVC TreeList Substitute Filter?
Grid View has settings.SubstituteFilter = (s, e) => {}, but didn't find the same for Tree List in MVC
Need to get current filter and add new values based on condition like in Grid View:
 settings.SubstituteFilter = (s, e) =>
        {
            var gridView = (MVCxGridView)s;
            if (ViewData["GeographyFilter"] != null)
            {
                var criterias = CriteriaColumnAffinityResolver.SplitByColumns(CriteriaOperator.Parse(gridView.FilterExpression));
                if (ViewData["GeographyFilter"].ToString() == string.Empty)
                {
                    criterias[new OperandProperty("Description4")] = null;
                    criterias[new OperandProperty("Description3")] = null;
                    criterias[new OperandProperty("Description2")] = null;
                    criterias[new OperandProperty("Description1")] = null;
                }
                else
                {
                    var newValues = ViewData["GeographyFilter"].ToString().Split(',');
                    var level = ViewData["GeographyLevel"].ToString();
                    switch (level)
                    {
                        case "4":
                            criterias[new OperandProperty("Description4")] = new InOperator("Description4", newValues);
                            break;
                        case "3":
                            criterias[new OperandProperty("Description3")] = new InOperator("Description3", newValues);
                            break;
                        case "2":
                            criterias[new OperandProperty("Description2")] = new InOperator("Description2", newValues);

Hello,
I'm wondering if there is any way to export a dxTreeList to Excel File? Something similar to the  export configuration for dxDatagrid here:

We are using a WinForms environment and want to know if there is any technique that can be applied to dynamically load the details associated with a parent row in the grid when the + expansion button is clicked.   That is, using the primary key of the parent, only load the details with same key value in the foreign key of the details.
All the examples that I have seen so far have the data adapters fill the dataset/data table on form load however this technique, in our case, has resulted in slow grid load time due to the extremely large volume of data in the detail load - in our production database there are currently 3361 rows and in the details, there are currently 64015 rows.   So you can imagine how long it takes to load the data, especially the details, into the table adapter.
I have been given to understand that the "on demand" load of details is relatively easy in a WebForms application and was wondering if the same or very similar technique can be applied to a WinForms application.

I'm using the 'ChartControl' to display a strip chart of our analog data acquisition results. I'm using a 'LineSeriesView' type of line.
After accumulating data for ~1 minute, the chart control starts consolidating data points into (what looks to be) the minor tick spacing. The attached screen shot shows the result.
How do I turn off this behavior and have the ChartControl draw  a continuous line, regardless of the minor tick settings?
Thanks,
Aaron 

I'm using the 'ChartControl' to display a strip chart of our analog data acquisition results. I'm using a 'LineSeriesView' type of line.
We often have gaps in our data stream and I want there to be an empty gap in the chart plot. I'm accomplishing this by creating separate series points. However, I want all the series to be the same color and I'm not sure how to accomplish this. Here's my code for creating a new series:
 
 I set the line color on the second line but it doesn't seem to do anything. Take a look at the attached screen shot.
Thanks,

When I delete a row in the grid I got an ORMEntityIsDeletedException in event ShowingEditor,  this did not happen before (I don't know when it starts to fail)

- Row is deleted form the gridview

Intellisense has stopped working for markup in my project. While at the time I could not pinpoint a particular trigger, after seeing ticket T463026  I realized that I had also recently changed the application build to x64. This is happening on both of my PCs, even after reinstalling DevExpress and trying to run project converter/upgrade tool

Hello guys.
There are many tickets in your KDB  but I havent found the correct for me.
I want to sustitute the standar javascript alert by the PopupControl, including confirmation actions, show alert icons (question, error, warning), etc.
Do you have any sample where implement PopupControl in web forms (#C or VB).
Something like a "Hello World" sample ;)

We have discovered that dashboard master filtering does not work properly in IE 11. We noted a similar ticket that had no resolution at 
.
To set up a test, you must create a dashboard with multiple widgets that have multiple master filter set . When you select the first widget to filter it, the effect of the filter is seen, but the dashboard appears to forever be in loading state (spinning icon in upper right). If you select a second widget, no additional filtering is applied and the state of all of the other widgets goes to the spinning/loading state.
After debugging, we found that  the dashboard Javascript is using an Array.findIndex call that IE does not implement that causes a Javascript error. We included a definition for Array.findIndex that we found from 
 in one of our Javascript files and found that the dashboard now appears to work.

I have a series of columns which display derived/unbound data.
How can I access the value of a derived cell to be used in another derived cell? I am looking into accessing the grid data source, but I don't have the row number to use cellValue.
EDIT: I have used DataSource mapping to derive the fields on the data loading. However my totals columns are not reflecting this data - the mapped fields are undefined when the totals are calculated (I added a custom total in calculateCustomSummary). How can I use my columns in a summary?

Hello,
 I have been looking through the demos, and am trying to find the right control for selecting images or uploading images that mimics the InsertImageDialog from the ASPxHtmlEditor.
In my current project, I have created a page for users to create a webpage with specific parameters, namely a primary heading, a headerimage, and then their own html content via the  ASPxHtmlEditor.
Presently, the header  image is selected via a combobox which is populated from a sql datasource, or uploaded via a separate upload control. This is not nearly as robust as the functionality that comes with the htmleditor, which we have also have connected to a remote Amazon AWS directory for all of our images.
Is there a way to get the same functionality as the  InsertImageDialog to allow users to browse and select an image or upload their own?

The Guest Names field requires a Facility and Facility Type to be selected.  
When Facility is selected, it populates the Facility Type.
But when Facility Type is selected, I expect for it to populate the Guest Names field but javascript errors are displaying.  
The one thing that is different from this WebService and the others, is that this one requires 2 parameters (Facility and Facility Type(Service)) instead of one.
Thanks

We've just upgraded from DX 16.2.3 and an old problem we had has returned where our OCX can no longer be registered with Wndows using REGSVR32 - it just hangs.
This feels very famliar as we had a similar issue back in the day of 16.2.2 where there was an issue in cxDateUtils.pas to do with InitializeUtils/FinalizeUtils which you supplied a hotfix for and then fixed in 16.2.3
I've checked this cxDateUtils.pas file again, but thats not the cause of it this time.
Can you help please?

I have an interesting situation.  
I have a form that has the following
   SplitControl
         Panel1
             PivotGrid
         Panel2 
             ButtonBar (with all the Chart controls ) 
             ChartControl
I am trying to duplicate some of this on a UserControl - and I am running into an issue
When I have
UserControl
   SplitControl
         Panel1
             PivotGrid
         Panel2 
             ChartControl
         
and then right click on the Chart Control - use the quick action button in the upper right - and choose Bar Manager.   
It does not place the ButtonBar  in the Panel2 - but at the top of the UserControl.  Which is NOT where I want it :) 
So - I am wondering how I can get the button bar to dock in the Panel2 at the top???  Which is where I have it in the original form.  The attached screen shot shows how the current form looks.   
Is it possible to dock the buttonbar in the Panel2 of the SplitControl (which is how it is in the main form)

I am having issue modifying attribute to DevExtreme MVC control wrapper by using JS.

Please enlighten me. Thanks.
 

Hello,
I have configured a conditional formatting for DataGrid rows using data from the not visible column (rows background color should be changed). When I run the application I see that this conditional formatting is applied correctly, but when I try to export to xls/xlsx (I am using Data Aware export type), the conditional formatting isn't working. When I make the column visible, conditional formatting works in export. How can I highlight rows in export file and do not show the column with data?
Thanks in advance.

Hey,
I have a problem I need your help to solve.
I have a datasource that is listing in each row a usage of a certain tool.
I need to now create a table that has 2 columns, 1 with the count of those usages and a 2nd column that shows a numbers that is representas that same number when we remove "waste" from column 1 number.
For example if user used 100 times tool 1, column 1 value should be 100, and if waste is 50% column 2 should show 50.
The waste percentage I calculated with the calculated field shown below, now I would need to multiply that percentage with the value in column1, but this does not seem to work.
Please advize

Hi 
 I am doing obfuscation of wpf applicaion.
 After obfuscation the IDialogServices stop executing.
 
  

I'm saving richeditcontrols content to html to store in the database. Now when the document contains a bullet list the font of the bullets is changed to arial. I know why this is as I read about it on this forum. However the users now store the text to the database and when they reload the data and try to add another bullet, this new bullet is no longer in the desired font. 
Is there a way to not use arial but the current font, because the content will never be visible online. Or is there another approach that you think I should take (maybe store as RTF, etc.)?
Thanks,
Yoni

Hello!
I have a SingleChoiceAction with several ChoiceActionItems. I need to open popup window with ListView to let user choose one or many records based on ChoiceActionItem selected by user.
Im using the following code to open popup window:
As you see, im checking if user select correct records according to the prior selection of ChoiceActionItem.
The problem is - if im setting E.Cancel to true, XAF opens detail view of the selected record. I dont need that, i need to simply do nothing if user clicks on record that does not fit certain criteria.
How i can prevent opening of new popup window when user clicks on record in popup window and DialogController.Accepting event is cancelled?
Thank you! 

Hi,

I am using ASPXFormLayout.
I've setup a tabbed section at the bottom of the page (TabbedLayoutGroup) 
On one of the tabs (<dx:LayoutGroup Caption="Photos"  VerticalAlign="Top" >) I have set up three items:
ASPxComboBox, ASPxImageGallery and ASPxUploadControl
When using the ASPxUploadControl I want ONLY the  ASPxComboBox and ASPxImageGallery to be refreshed - not the entire page.
I've put the contents of the tab in an update panel and a nested ASPXFormLayout but cant figure out how get the panel to update the list and images.
Once a file has been uploaded the code behind runs fine but the changes are not reflected in the list or gallery.
Hope this makes sense. Thank You.

Hi Team,
In Devexpress v9.3 for wpf grid control :- How to raise custom cell draw event ?
Regards,
Preeti

Hi,
i am using this code in order to set custom selection color for currently selected rows at grid view:
            ((GridView)gcNotServed.Views[0]).OptionsSelection.EnableAppearanceFocusedCell = true;
            ((GridView)gcNotServed.Views[0]).OptionsSelection.EnableAppearanceFocusedRow = true;
            ((GridView)gcNotServed.Views[0]).Appearance.FocusedCell.BackColor = customColor;
            ((GridView)gcNotServed.Views[0]).Appearance.FocusedRow.BackColor = customColor;
            ((GridView)gcNotServed.Views[0]).Appearance.SelectedRow.BackColor = customColor;
            ((GridView)gcNotServed.Views[0]).Appearance.SelectedRow.Options.UseBackColor = true;
It works but when i select row and then i click for example into different gridView, then selected row color became white. 
How can i return origin color after (during?) rows deselection?
Btw: this works perfect if i dont use custom selection color, so i guess there is some function which handles it.

Hello,
Since the update to version 17.2.5 we observed the following behavior in the spreadsheet:
A simple click on a cell change the value of the Modified property to true and enable the save button of the ribbon even if no proper modification has been done.
The behavior has been observed in both our own project and the different examples you provide.
Do you plan to go back to the previous behaviour, which, we think, was more logical ?
If no, is there a way to handle the Modified  property ourselves and retablish the previous behaviour in our project ?

In DevExpress WPF grid, I'm generating columns dynamically see below ticket.
In Columns I need to bind Columns to objects using indexer that returns System.Object, so I need to type cast it to object. Please note indexer of object and it's contained objects returns System.Object and indexers have some business logic to return objects based on index.
I tried like below but it doesn't work
Please note UnboundExpression will evaluate to as below for e.g.
 
Also tried using Binding Path:

Enter the name of node "Child1" : if "Chi" - the parent node will expand, but if "ild1" - it will not expand. 
 

I'm looking for a way to show a group footer only if the group is expanded. I've read about the GroupFooterShowMode enumeration. The VisibleAlways allows to display group footer for every group, even if they are not expanded. The VisibleIfExpanded shows group footer for expanded groups only, as I desire, but only if there are group summaries already set up. How to avoid this? I mean, I would like to show group footer for expanded groups only, but always, even if group summaries are not set up. Is there a way to achieve this?
Thank you.

Hi,
i am using this code in order to set custom selection color for currently selected rows at grid view:

            ((GridView)gcNotServed.Views[0]).Appearance.SelectedRow.BackColor = customColor;
            ((GridView)gcNotServed.Views[0]).Appearance.SelectedRow.Options.UseBackColor = true;
It works good for mouse click row selection, but when i use view.SelectRow(counter);  , then it still keeps selecting in origin way unfortunatelly.
What is the solution how to use Select method in custom colors?

Our application is upgraded to 2015.2.4 some time ago. Now we see that something is not working anymore. By some search work I see that the mechanism of the reportwizard is changed.
We have a customized report wizard because we only want  the customer to select a label (no datasource for example).
In the previouw version 2013.x.x we used this mechanism:
ReportBase is a subclass of XtraReport.
Now the problem. In the new situatio (at this moment we use 2015.2.4) this is the mechanism to use:
The problem is that we couldn't check if the user cancels the wizard and that we could provide our subclassed XtraReport instance to the wizard.
How can we fix this?
 


Hello, 
what NuGet package should I use to reference DevExpress.XtraReports.v17.2.Extensions.dll ? Or more specifically, how can I work with 
 class ?
I'm working with WebForms using DX 17.2.3 version for .Net 4.0.
Thanks in advance.

I'm trying to set the GroupFooterRowStyle values to "Bold". (Attached screenshot)
This is a dynamically constructed Grid and TableView (not via xaml).
I'm trying to set the values bold in code as follows :-
I get an exception error when assigning the customResourceDictionary :-
 
What am I missing/doing wrong here ?
 


Hi
I am using a DXDialogWindow to show a Login Dialog at application startup.  Whist there are examples of this in the help files and support tickets I have need allow the login to allow some fixed values when the application is run first time and then later on refer to the application's backend database to verify a user's name and password.  So to that extent the login view needs to have a corresponding viewmodel that can take this scenario into account.  I have therefore opted to use the messenger service to communicate back to the mainViewModel that instantiated the Login Dialog when the login is closed.
The problem I'm currently facing is one of layout.  Firstly I'm using the DataLayout control because I want to make use of its ability to show datavalidation symbols (that works).  I also want to be able to show a simple check or cross image to the side of the User Name and Password Datalayout items that will be shown (with the appropriate image) when the user name and password have been validated.  Only a valid combination will trigger the enablement of the login button.
Before adding the image placeholders into the view the layout (thanks to the datalayout control) worked nicely.  Since adding them it doesn't (see the attached image)
Secondly, given that dialog is there purely to get the end user to enter their name and password it really only needs the login and cancel buttons to handle closure.  Can I remove the standard min, max and close buttons that form part of the dialog window chrome, and if so how.
This is the current xaml I have for the view




and for the sake of completeness this is the viewmodel as it stands 



The Login dialog is called from the main viewmodel like so;




Many thanks
Dom

Lastly is it possible to use your SvgImageSource magic to place svg images into the plain image control (which I wish to do dynamically from the viewmodel depending on whether the Username and Password pass validation or fail, thus giving the end user a visual clue to correctness or otherwise).

Hi,
i have read the documention for grouping: 
Is it possible to group several levels? 
I would also like to collapse/expand These groups?
Do you have plans to attach a treelist in near future?
Thanks in advance.

Dear support,
My current data bound scheduler implementation uses a custom appointment edit form because of the need to support attendees as well. In database the attendees records are stored in different table (rather in "Appointments") and because of this I added in the custom edit form a "CheckedComboBoxEdit" control.
During the loading of the appointment form, I'm 1st loading all available attendees records in the control and as a 2nd step I'm fetching the related attendees list linked to the appointment and the control marks the corresponding data. So far so good!
On the main form that the scheduler control is located, I'm using the events "AppointmentsInserted", "AppointmentsChanged" and "AppointmentsDeleted" to execute the needed CRUD operations.
The main question now, is from these events how I will get the status on the "CheckedComboBoxEdit" control in order to apply the needed changes on the "Attendees" table? Is it possible through the custom fields mechanism? If yes, how can I do that? Please provide any possible solution.
Best regards,
Andreas 

Currently I convert c.DataItem as following code
    settings.SetItemTemplateContent((c) =>
    {
        var data = new WIHO_B2B_Beta.Controllers.OrderController.DataSample();
        data.FieldA = DataBinder.Eval(c.DataItem, "FieldA").ToString();
        data.FieldB = DataBinder.Eval(c.DataItem, "FieldB").ToString();
        Html.RenderPartial("_Test", data);
    });
I'm wondering is there any better method to do it?

Hello 
I've been trying to develp a planner solution using tcxScheduler and i've come across some issues, 
1
if i use a "large" timestep like 30/60 minute its possible that my events will overlap eachother, 
ie. event1 - 10:00 -> 12h13 
     event2 - 12h25->13h00
if i use timestep 30' this will occur, 
can the event be displayed in it's correct position, the only way i eas able to reproduce the intended behaviour was to define 1min as time step and then hide lines, this is not satisfactory because of the space consumed and makes horizontal scroll a pain..
  
thanks for your time

Hi ,
I would like to pass the value of a dependency property to a mainviewmodel. 
As you can see in the example attached, I have a MainWindow that simply calls the other View called Main.
In its model I have two properties, Property1 and Property2. I want to set these properties and pass them to the TestView View.
TestView has a Dependency Property Called MyProperty and a field Called "LabelValue".
I don't know how to join MyProperty with LavelValue in the ViewModel.
Could you please help me?

Hello,
I'm using dxPivotGrid and i'd like to know if it's possible  to mantain the colors of my pivot when exported?
 I tried to export it using jquery to keep the colors (i exported the html), but i'm using the virtual scrolling and the data comes incomplete, so if there's not how to export this using just the events of dxPivotGrid, is there a way that i can get the data on the export event and then use my jquery export, so i can keep the colors and get the right values?

I was able to setup the diagram control and bind some data to it.
In the template designer I chose a circle and a n connector template. That works quite fine. All circles are created and connected accordingly to the links I setup.
My model looks like this:
I don't understand how I would create multiple design templates which are rendered based on some condition (model type or property)
For example:
Now I want to achieve multiple things:
- I want to put a label on top of the circle bound to each stage  name
- I would like to render all items within a stage into that circle.
- Each item should be visualized based on the type, let's say, an arrow for Type == 1 and a circle for Type == 2
- How would I do the positioning?
How can I achieve that? 
Thanks for the help! 


Hi, I have tried this code, but it doesnt work for me.
Devexpress 17.1
GridColumn.AppearanceHeader.BackColor = White
private void gvPrijemZadanek_CustomDrawColumnHeader(object sender, ColumnHeaderCustomDrawEventArgs e)
        {
            if (e.Column != null && e.Column.AppearanceHeader.BackColor != Color.Empty)
            {
                e.Info.AllowColoring = true;
            }
        }
Code goes to e.Info... sets it on true, but back color is still from the used skin :(

Hello,
in the meantime we have many customers that have different desires.
Is there a way to enable/disable parts of a given model layout depending on, for example, compiler directives or static boolean variables ?  
We want to disable a tab, layoutgroup, field or button for customer A, but enable these for customer B and another combination for customer C.
Thank you

Hi,
I prefer this type of layout for initializing e.g. a class
            Class1 cls = new Class1()
            {
                PropertyName = "test"
                , PropertyName1 = "test2"
                , PropertyName2 = "test3"
            };
If I use smart duplicate line (Shift Enter) on e.g. theline with test3, Coderush  copies the line but also adds a comma at the end of the line...
            Class1 cls = new Class1()
            {
                PropertyName = "test"
                , PropertyName1 = "test2"
                , PropertyName2 = "test3",
                ,
                PropertyName3 = "test3"
            };
Also see the attached video 

Hi DevExpress Support,
      I just want to ask for help about a certain use case where I have a view model called "CreateUserViewModel" as shown below.
that is bound to a devextreme form, but I have a property of that view model which is a collection of a certain type, "CategoryViewModel" and "CategoryViewModel"  acts as a parent node in a heirarchy as shown below.
Its child nodes which are of the "RoleViewModel" type have a property called "Selected" which is either true or false as shown below.
The goal is to push the updates to the "Selected" property of the RoleViewModel type when the form is submitted.
 My initial plan was to use a separate control from a devextreme from which is a devextreme tree view, since the view model is being passed into the view, I'm expecting that whenever I made changes to that "Selected" property of RoleViewModel by checking or unchecking child nodes in the tree view, I would be able to still capture it when I submit the form, but turns out, I'm only passing the property values that are bound inside of a devextreme form even though both the devextreme form and devextreme tree view are inside of a form tag, 
     Here is the view code which details my initial plan
Just want your suggestion on what is the most effective approach to this ? 
Thanks!
Jude Alquiza.

When a BottstrapGridView's SettingsBeahviour has "ConfirmDelete = true", the grid users a javascript CONFIRM prompt to prompt the user if they're sure about deleting the record.
I would like to replace the default javascript  CONFIRM to use a nicer Bootstrap modal prompt instead.
Please can you tell me how to accomplish this?

Hello,
I have a XAF application (WIN/WEB) which has about 200 persistent object classes (XPO). 
I have added the XAF MOBILE project (module.mobile and .mobile) am trying to run the Mobile  app in the browser.
I have seen that on startup it creates all the views, even those of object that are not interesting for me. So I would like to use in my XAF Mobile model only those objecs (5/6) that are interesting,  avoiding creating all views for unnecessary objecs. 
I have seen also that all controllers are created in startup process, so the app startup is very slow (10 minutes!)
How can I resolve this?
Thank you

Hi Support,
I'd like to implement the select all and unselect all behavior in a GridView .
There are two button in the Status's column Header , one is select all another one is unselect all .
My question as below :
1. When I click select all button  then status column will be set to 1 by callback , 
   or click unselect all button  then status column will be set to 0 by callback .
     But  the gridview status 's checkbox  does not show  correctly .
The checkbox value is difference with database table value. 
2. If I want to use one checkbox in the status column  header to instead of select all and unselect all buttons .
  How to make this checkbox value correctly.  when I just checked the checkbox or just unchecked the checkbox  ? 
Table schema : 
 
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Parts](
 [PartNo] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
 [PartName] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
 [Status] [int] NOT NULL
) ON [PRIMARY]
GO
Please help me to solve these issues, Thanks ! 

I'm using the ExcelDataSource.EditDataSource wizard - and I was wondering if it would be possible to customize that wizard with another wizard-page, or add more fields to an existing page.
I'd like to ask the user about things like 'cell range' and some other options (boolean/checkbox) things - and retrieve the values so that I can store it too.

Hi DevExpress Support,
I might need a suggestion/help from you in updating Column Width/Heights in an efficient way. I have a code  that is taking time and impacting performance of my application. 
I have a sim ple code that loops through column collection and updates the Visibility and Width. I have this solution attached, if you could run this solution and notice 
window you might notice Debug statements that logs time take for each Column Width & Visibility set.
In the above code (Ignore rest of the code, I'm just running this code in different thread) I'm just setting Width/Visibility for each column and logging time taken for each of them.
I suspect this time consumption is due to (Grid)UI updates since UI being refreshed as soon as we set Width/Visibility. 
I would really appreciate if you could help with below queries.
1. What is the efficient way of setting Width/Visibility that doesn't post UI update immediately? (I tried suspend/resume layout call that doesn't help)
Thanks,
Hari Prasad

in my xaf application module I have a custom CloneController that inherits from CloneObjectViewController.
Now I have added the mobile module, so when I try to start mobile application I have this error:
It seems that in mobile application there is the MobileCloneObjectViewController that inhertis from  CloneObjectViewController, so there are 2 controllers that inherit from CloneObjectViewController. How can I solve this, in xaf mobile app?
Thank you 

Hey folks,
how would you recommend to show a wizard form to configure some global setting on a XAF Application (Windows and Web)  at the first start?
Best,

I am attempting to produce custom map markers from items added on-the-fly to a MapControl.  I am following examples found in other questions, such as these:
I have this class for individual items to be mapped:
This is how they are added:
This is the MapControl in XAML:
And these are the templates defined in my global ResourceDictionary.xaml:
In reality, it doesn't seem to matter what I do with the named templates...they are never applied to the pushpins that are generated for the map.  I have tried placing the template definition directly into the control, both in Resources, and in the MarkerTemplate tag itself.  Neither worked.
The only way I have ever gotten this to work is to create MapPushpin items directly in the XAML, giving each one the template name.  Why do these template not seem to work the way the examples suggest they should?
 

Hi,
I have exactly the same problem as discussed in Q584092: DateEdit is reversed to the first month if an end-user types an invalid day
 
 I agree to what Demetrius writes in his solution. But I need a way to change the way your DateEdit handles the invalid  day/month combination, so that I can  set the month to 12 (or make any other change) when the user enters the 31st of November.
 
 Let me explain  why: 
 The date format is dd.MM.yyyy. The current value is 30.11.2017 and the day part of the date is selected. The user wants to add 1 day to this date and types "31". Currently, the new value will be 31.01.2017. This is not the expected behavior. If I could override your method, I could resolve the invalid day/month combination (31.11.2017) by changing the edit value to either 31.12.2017 (because it is closer to the original value) or even try to guess what the user meant (my application has more information than your control: other related dates in the same form, for example.) and set the edit value to 01.12.2017.

Hi,
I want to use conditional formating using an icon set but the rule is different for each record. It seems that I may be able to do it using a formula but how can I use formulas in a tableview?

Hi support team!
The first component selected has the AutoPostBack = False property, the second AutoPostBack = True.
When I select the "Montadora", reload my screen completely.
How to make the screen does not recharge completely.
I used to use UpdatePanel, but I do not know how to do it in DevExpress. Do you have an example, please?

HI Team,
Dev Express icon not visible in IE 11.
e.g. Export button, column chooser not visible.
 
please help on that. 

I have a simple DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonControl with few barbuttonitems in it. It doesnt have borders on left or right. Is there any setting which would give it borders so that it gives a nice enclosing look? Right now it those lines look half-hearted :)
I am using the theme "Office 2013"

I am considering using DevXtreme for a project.  My most important grid needs to use an edit form or popup that uses a cascading combobox that is filtered depending on the selection made in another combobox.  Looking at your literature and support tickets I am unclear whether this technology is available in DevXtreme.  Can you refer me to information answering this question and hopfully showing how it is done in JQuery?
Thanks! 

Hi,
 i've configured a GridView in my application with a number of adaptivity settings that will cause it to collapse at a certain window width. Collapsing works fine but in collapsed mode the GridView no longer displays the buttons for expanding/collapsing the detail row of my datasets.
Is there a setting that will cause the GridView to display the expand/collapse buttons for the detail row also in collapsed mode or any other way that i can expand/collapse the detail row in collapsed mode?
Thx in advance! 

Hi, 
i build a MVC sample that works with IE and Firefox, but not with Chrome. Start it, select "Edit" in the grid column and choose a file. In IE and FireFox the UploadControlCallback is called first, and after this the AddNewUploadItem, so my code works. In Chrome its turned around, so my code is not working... Can you check this out?

I have another question,maybe you can help me:
I work with HTML document.
private void WriteBodyText(string text)
{
using (Stream stream = new MemoryStream())
{
TextWriter writer = new StreamWriter(stream);
writer.Write(text);
writer.Flush();
stream.Position = 0;
richEditControl1.LoadDocument(stream, DocumentFormat.Html);
}
when the scroll comes to top,
I need to add a new HTML text from the start and move scroll to end of new text
This code:
Init:
RichEditViewVerticalScrollController controller;
int lastScrollPosition;
onload:
controller = (RichEditViewVerticalScrollController)richEditControl1.ActiveView.GetType().InvokeMember("VerticalScrollController", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.GetProperty | BindingFlags.Instance, null, richEditControl1.ActiveView, null);
controller.ScrollBar.Scroll += ScrollBar_Scroll;
private void ScrollBar_Scroll(object sender, ScrollEventArgs e)
{
if (controller.ScrollBar.Value == 0)
{                    
string newText=.... //get new text from DB
//add newText to richEditControl1
lastScrollPosition=newText.Length;
SetLastScrollPosition();                    
}
}
private void SetLastScrollPosition()
{
controller.ScrollBar.Scroll -= ScrollBar_Scroll; 
DocumentPosition position = rrichEditControl1.Document.CreatePosition(lastScrollPosition);
richEditControl1.Document.CaretPosition = position;
richEditControl1.ScrollToCaret();
controller.ScrollBar.Scroll += ScrollBar_Scroll;
}
After SetLastScrollPosition() CaretPosition is in the right place,
but ScrollBar all time on top position.
What am I doing wrong?
Thanks

Hi,

The approach like at

Hi We recently upgraded from version 13.1 to version 17.1, and there has been a change of behavior that we have some trouble finding an effective solution for...
We have a grid bound to a DataTable via a BindingSource component, and all seems to be normal 
BUT.
In the old version, when typing in filter for a column with the AutoFilterRow, the Position of the BindingSource was automatically set to the first filtered row in the grid, and all other controls changed according to this which was what we wanted.
Now in version 17.1 when having ImmediateUpdateAutoFilter = True as we want, the grid is filtered as wanted, but the position of the BIndingSource stays the same until I move focus away from the column in the AutoFilterRow
I have handled it by adding the code below, but it is not extremely effective. Is there any other way to get the old behavior back ?

Hello! Sorry for my bad english.
I make tree view with single-selection mode and filtering field
https://plnkr.co/edit/pcRHKtpCksJ7LaDebCXh?p=preview 
1. go to filter box and write 'plus' - then displayed only items, contains this word
2. select one item. now give message - item selected. When tree unfocused - this item displayed as gray .
3. now clear filter box and write 'led'  - then displayed items with this word
4. select one item - now give message - item selected. When tree unfocused - this new item displayed as gray .
5. clear filter box - now hilight OLD selected item. No messages about changing selection. 
IMHO after clearing filter, need hilight NEW item, or generate notification about changing selection to old.

Hello:
We are using Delphi Tokyo Update 2 and DevExpress 17.2.3.
We have the following problem: we have a DLL that shows a TForm working fine . When we add a TcxTreeList component to the form and call it from a testing program we have an access violation message.
Similar thing happens if we add a TdxS kinController. Access Violation in a different point. We don't know if there are similar problems with other DevExpress components.
Until last week we where using  Delphi Berlin with DevExpress 16.1.6 without any problem.
I'm attaching  a sample project group. It has a DLL with a TForm with a TcxTreeList in it, and a Test EXE program that calls this DLL form.
Our applications are 32 bit.

Hi
This is the first time I have tried to create a ComboBoxEdit in a GridControl and I'm struggling with it.
I have a GridControl bound to a collection. One of the items in this collection is an int called 'PossibleMatchId' and it has it's own column.
In this column I want to present a ComboBoxEdit, which will have an ItemsSource that changes when the selected row is changed. This item source is called 'PossibleMatches' and I have code that refreshes this collection when the selected row is changed. The property in this collection I wish to display to the user is 'DisplayString', the value that I wish to use is called 'ID' and I wish to connect this 'ID' value in the items source to the 'PossibleMatchId' in the items source of the grid.
This is a snippet of my code:
<dxg:GridColumn Header="Possible Existing Match"  FieldName="PossibleMatchId" AllowEditing="True" >
  <dxg:GridColumn.EditSettings>
      <dxe:ComboBoxEditSettings ItemsSource="{Binding PossibleMatches}" DisplayMember="DisplayString" ValueMember="ID">
          <dxe:ComboBoxEditSettings.StyleSettings>
            <dxe:ComboBoxStyleSettings/>
           </dxe:ComboBoxEditSettings.StyleSettings>
         </dxe:ComboBoxEditSettings>
       </dxg:GridColumn.EditSettings>
</dxg:GridColumn>
Currently there are no values displayed in this column (if I remove the value for 'ValueMember' the values are displayed). If I click on the column I get the combo box and it has the right values in it for the selected row. When I selected a value I see the value in the cell, but when I click away the value is gone again. So my main problem here is connecting the value in the ComboBoxEdit items source with the value in the grid items source.
Any advice appreciated! 

Dear DevExpress,
Accoring to the documentation, the '&' is supposed to perform a bitwise logical AND operation between two integer values.
See: 
This does not seem to be working on my system: an expression like '[value] & 128' is not accepted. Expressions like '[value] ^ 128' seem fine.
See attachment.
Is this a bug or am I mis-using the & operator?
Thanks,
Bob
 

Hello!
Please see the attached sample application.
In this master detail grid, you can click on the button "Expand" or  the builtin plus/minus toggle button to expand and collapse the master row.
But while IsFocusScope=True in the surrounding container, only with the builtin toggle button the master row keeps its focus. With the "Expand" button, the focus is lost.
How can I achieve the same behaviour?

Hi
We upgraded from Version 16.2.5 To 17.2.5 and thereafter our WebChartControl does not load the data as it dit befor the upgrade.
Please see attached webapps that I included.
The data is loded from an xml file.
It works fine in the 16.2.5 version but the data does not load in 17.2.5 version.
Could you please advise.
Thanx

Hi,
I have a TcxGridDBTableView that is setup with multiple grouped values in a single group header.  When the data is refreshed, I need to put the focus back to where it was (or as close to) before the refresh.
Currently I am recording the Top row index and the Focused row index  before the refresh, and resetting them after the refresh.  However, some users are complaining that the view looks different after the refresh.
This is because when the group has a lot of records (say 100)  the views top row is the group header (as it's sticky) but the data row beneath that is not the first data row,  but in fact may be the 75th data row of that group.
How do I set the top row within the group so I can get the view looking exactly the same before & after the refresh.  
I attach an image that I hope explains things better.
Kind regards
Stuart
 

Hi,
Have a query on Export , when merging and grouping enabled in the aspxgridview is  it possible to get the export without the merge and grouping ? 
We tried ExportType DataAware, Default and WYSIWYG. In all we could see the data merge and grouping preserved. Is there any way in aspxgridview , we can export the raw data as it is. no merge and no grouping.

Thanks. I have noticed when exporting master-details grid the details grids are expanded by default in the excel file. How can we make export to not have expanded details grid. 

Hello,
In our application we have huge sets of data stored in a database that are displayed to end-user in GridView. We have it implemented with our own mechanism for lazy loading - it fetches and displays more and more data directly from database while scrolling the view. Autofiltering doesn't work well with this, which is understandable, because it can filter only that data, which is currently loaded into the grid's datasource. So we have "handmade" custom filters outside the grid - but it's not the most elegant or efficient solution and we want to have proper filtering that works in grid itself. So I'd like to ask - how can I implement custom behaviour for autofilter row? The desired behaviour, in short, would be like this: user writes something in one of autofilter row's column, then it invokes our logic for getting required data from database and results are displayed in the grid. Any help would be appreciated! :)
Best regards, 
Piotr

hi,
i have a grid with 2 columns. 
<dxg:GridColumn FieldName="RelatedItemsDisplayString" Header="{Binding DependantFilesHeader}" CellToolTipBinding="{Binding RelatedItemsTooltip}" BestFitArea="Header"/
            <dxg:GridColumn FieldName="AttachedPrintersCount" Header="{Binding AttachedPrinterNamesHeader}" CellToolTipBinding="{Binding AttachedPrintersTooltip}"/> 
the second is able to display its content within the cell, so there is no "[value]..." within the cell.
the first is unable to do that, since the  bestfitarea is set to header, so there is a "[value]..." within the cell, indicating there is an overflow of text within the cell. in this case, CellToolTipBinding is ignored, and the tooltip of that cell is the FieldName. 


I needed a separate settings window to choose a resource to set the work hours and holidays etc.. not to select the resource on the window.  
Thanks

I have a CustomButtonEdit to represent a "Run State" in a grid column. The button image starts out as a run image. When the button is clicked then the image is swapped out to show a "Cancel" image. My editor appears to register correctly and I can select it from lists in the designer. When I run my program the editor shows up correctly in each row. However when I click a button ALL the images change in every row of the column instead of just the cell I click in. I'm sure the answer is simple but I can't come up with it. Can you see what I'm doing wrong?
I've attached my program.
Thanks,
Ed 

I have a requirement where the user want to do inline editing in the cells in the gridview but when when double clicking the row, the editform should open up so the user can continue editing the rest of the column values.
Is this possible ?  I am able to do either inPlace or editform mode but could not find a way to do both in the same gridview.

Hi,
 In your demos of the spell checker, you set the culture to "English (United States)", e.g. 
 I need to set it to British English, but I have tried different options, e.g. "English (United Kingdom)" without luck. If I do not specify "English (United States)" it will reject all words.
Since the IntelliSense does not give me a list of options, could you please do so?
Thank you,

I have an invoice report. Similar in style to your invoice report in your Demo centre, except I don't have the extra detail report section and no groupings.
So I have  the Page Header with a table of column headers - Name and Price, the Detail contains the values for these columns, then the Report Footer, contains a total.
I want the Report Footer to be at the bottom, and the Detail area to stretch to fill the available space (so that the lines go all the way to the bottom regardless of lines.
How would you recommend solving this problem? Seems quite messy to have to do it all with cross-band boxes etc, especially because I am using tables? 

Is there a way to change the value of a select box programmatically (with javascript function) without triggering the OnValueChanged event?

Hi,
When I compile sample reporting project which is created by project wizard, the satellite  dlls automatically are being copied to the bin directory. This case is not true for an other existing project which is not created by project wizard. What is the mechanism of copying satellite dlls automatically under bin directory?

Hi,
Please find the attached sample.
Problem found:
1) Search for a node and when the search is still in progress make the node bold.
2) You can make the node bold by applying Snoop and Searching for the property FontWeight and changing it to bold.
As i could not simulate the same in the sample, I am asking you to use Snoop and reproduce the same issue.
As a whole i need a solution where in the nodes are bold even though the Search is in progress.

Hi,
I am using  Angular 2.x approach.
I have a dxTextBox component which has custom validation rule that validates the input on server side. The problem is when i click the submit button it starts the validation server side and send the request to server. But submit action does not wait to get answer from the server because validateBarcode() method does not returns anything until get answer from the server. That's why it is not allowing to submit first time even validateBarcode() method validates. if click again it's submitting because it's  already validated in previous click. So i am trying to keep waiting submit action until validator get answer from the server. Is there anyway to achieve this?
p.s: i have tried to return $.Deferred() object in validateBarcode() method but it's not worked.
Thanks.

I have implemented a WinExplorerView with a breadcrumb (similar to your demo), although it's not based on files in the local file system. The file and folder records are stored in a database and the physical files are stored in Azure Blob storage. The folders are virtual and are database records only.
The BreadcrumbEdit control does not deal with duplicate folder names too well although I understand that Windows Explorer doesn't allow duplicates.
When navigating into a folder which has the same name as another, the Breadcrumb control will treat both folders as the same. This is because to change the Breadcrumb path, you have to set the path which is a string.
However, behind the scenes I am populating my Breadcrumb with a collection of objects, so each folder has its own id.
Is there a different way to change paths in the  Breadcrumb control so that it can navigate to a folder's id rather than by name? This is how I change paths at the moment: -

Our grid does not allow word wrap and in our data grid when the data in a cell is too wide the ellipsis is displayed as expected.
However when the data in the cell is three characters or less under the ellipsis the hover over does not appear.
In the attached image, above the black bar the hover over is displaying as we expect it to.
Below the bar, the cell circled in red does not display the hover over, the remainder of the text is "17" 

How may I implement a custom tooltip design on a bootstrap control when hovered. Alternatively how did you generate the 'help' on hover you have for this page when hovering over the input?

We have been experiencing some rather odd behavior with the serialization of the Dock Layout Manager.  In essence the control windows that are saved do not always open up at the same location as when they were serialized, and sometimes the controls won't even show up at all.  The behavior seems to be sporadic as sometimes it will work and other times it will not.  I've included a sample test project that demonstrates the issues that we're seeing.  There's a Test.xml file included that you can use to load and see what is happening, the Example.png image shows how the page layout looked with all of the controls prior to saving and restoring.

Hi,  
Good morning, I made an update to the current version and I see that in the webconfig of my project it has been updated but it has remained with the version with which I was working.  
For your help with this problem, I post the webconfig file. 

We have a data grid and are trying to implement export functionality.
The export data set is dependent on a number of filters set by the user and can range from one to over a million.
During testing we are noticing a limit of around 10,000 rows before the export function stops prompting users to save a file. 
Testing shows our data access is taking around 300ms to query data. 
There seems to be an issue when the data is being processed by the data grid.

I'm using a RepositoryItemRadioGroup bound to a RibbonControl. Whenever the GUI refreshes, it appears as if the selected index of the radio group is reset to default values. However, the selected index changed event does not fire which suggests that it's something surface level.
I've attached a sample project that demonstrates this. 

Hi,

The attached image shows what appears when I click on a meeting (I currently have delete disabled) but I'd like to make it so that when a user clicks on the  'Edit' option it carries out a redirect for me to another page rather than show an edit form (Clientside code).
Please can you advise how I can do that?
Thank you,
Stan

Hello support team,
Is there a way to determine which group a specific data row belongs to? I am working with a WinExplorerView but I think the view type doesn't matter. My goal is to select (focus) an item row and then click a button to collapse the group where this item is in.
What I found is the view.GetGroupRowDisplayText(view.FocusedRowHandle) method, which gives me the text of the group row. But I don't need the text but the group row's handle to perform the view.SetRowExpanded() method. Is there something like view.GetGroupRowHandle(rowHandle)?
Thank you!

It appears that scrolling of the Accordion Control only works if you have selected a Accordion Item Group Header.  Is there a way to allow scrolling when any portion of the AccordionContentContainer or any controls inside have focus?

Hi,
I have created a sample example to demonstrate the issue I am facing, the fiddle has been ran on IE11, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox.
Firefox and Edge does not give this behavior, however the behavior occurs in Chrome and IE 11.
Background:
We have a parent div - that consists of child divs - in one of the child divs this editor is placed.
The size can dragged around, so height and widgets of the widget can be changed. 
Dragging the parent to around size around 20-30px, the dxDropDownBox just sits there so that the "Select Value" text is half visible.
On click (on the dropdown icon), the dxDropDownBox text "jumps" up inside the div and  now the whole dxDropDownBox input box is visible.
Can you advise on what to do?

Upgrading from DevExpress VCL 12.1.6 to 17.2.4 the file size of my executable increased from 24 MB to 38 MB (Delphi XE).
Maybe normal (because there are 5 years between these releases) but inspecting the generated DCU files I found out that with 17.2.4 there are many new files. Most of them (97!!!) are DCUs of dxSpreadSheet with a total amount of 15MB.
I don't use the SpreadSheet component and I can't find any uses for dxSpreadSheet in my source files. Also I haven't added any DevExpress file to the uses sections when upgrading.
I use GridControl, Bars, LookAndFeel-Controller, ExpressPrinting, VerticalGrid and Express Editors.
My question: Is it normal that dxSpreadSheet DCUs are necessary for the components I use? If not, how can I find out why dxSpreadSheet DCUs will be compiled for my project?

Hello,
   I have an Excel data source. I would like to display it. However, Excel is not significat, it's only example. So, I can display it using SpreadSheetControl. It's fine, but too complicated to process the data programatically, it is either user unfriendly or even impossible.
   My goal is to sort both rows and columns by some criteria. Maybe I can sort rows by specified column data, but columns sorting seems to be impossible or very unfriendly using SpreadSheetControl.
    So, I am thinking about my own data model. I will load data to my data model, e.g. then I can transform the data by specified criteria and later save modified data back to the data source or do any other operation. The data are in matrix form 
.
   The problem is, how to display it in GUI?  There is unknown count of columns or rows. So, I think clasiccal GridView is impossible to use it (cannot define columns in design time etc.).
   Please, help. Thank you very much in advance.
   Best Regards,
     Radim 
PS: One of the goals is to sort the data in both dimensions and  then set custom background color to selected cells.

First I want to offer my congratulations on getting the longest unit name I have ever seen! Nice work: :-)
"cxDataControllerConditionalFormattingRulesManagerDialog"
But why is this unit name be added to my projects? 
 

Hello!
I have the following scenario. I display a TreeList with several nodes in it.
Initially the first node in the TreeList is selected and focused. I then have the functionality in my software to jump to a certain node within the tree list which means setting sole selection and focus on that node. I do that by. 
//code
Selection.Clear();
FocusedNode = nodeToSelect;
nodeToSelect.Selected = true;
//end code
After this every thing looks fine. But when I now try to additionally select the node below the one I jumped to with "Shift + Key Down" then actually the nodes from the TopNode all the way down to the current node are selected. If I by mouse select a different node than the topnode and then to a jump to and then a shift arrow then the range between the jumped to node and the node selected by click are selected. Does this have something to do with this code I found in the TreeListHandler
if(Data.SelectionAnchor == null)
                            Data.SelectionAnchor = Data.SelectionOldCell != null ? Data.SelectionAnchor = Data.SelectionOldCell : new TreeListCell(TreeList.FocusedNode, TreeList.FocusedColumn);
                        SelectAnchorRange(new TreeListCell(node, TreeList.FocusedColumn), Data.SelectionAnchor);
This lead me to try out to modify my jump to code and just execute it twice:
//code
Selection.Clear();
FocusedNode = nodeToSelect;
nodeToSelect.Selected = true;
Selection.Clear();
FocusedNode = nodeToSelect;
nodeToSelect.Selected = true;
//end code
When I do this everything works as I want it to.

Hi,
       I have the following requirements:
       1. Show selected items with incremental filtering on
       2. Search with incremental filtering on but retain already selected items
       
       For the above requirements, the closest I found is to use 'TokenLookUpEditStyleSettings' but it falls short of the above. Can you please help to achieve the above? I saw one solution suggesting to use extended version of LookupEdit which I don't want to do nor modify the source code and compile.
Separate Requirements - Can create a separate ticket if needed..
1. How to change the Foreground of the Null Text? 
2. How to change the style of the tokens?
Thanks,

I have two controls in a win form. 
1. A custom RichTextBox control that inherits from RichTextBox
2. A  TextEdit control.
When I invoke the spell checker it brings up the spelling dialog box which takes me through the words that are misspelled. After changing all the misspelled words and going back to the windows form. Neither customRichTextBox nor the TextEdit control are updated with the results.
What Am I doing wrong?

We would like an operator to be able to see a list of saved reports when they open the report designer, choose a report and print it without having to open it in design mode.
Is there a way to program this functionality?
Can we point the report designer to open a file where we have saved the reports?
Thanks. 

I have several projects that reference the DevExpress libraries for XtraReport. When I upgrade one of the projects from version 17.1 to 17.2, and then try to open the report designer, I get a version conflict error (see attached). It tries to load the components for version 17.1 instead of 17.2. Sometimes, when I close and reopen Visual Studio, the error is gone, but then the project with the old version has this problem. Also, I noticed that the licence file under Properties is now suddenly empty. Not sure if that's relevant. Any ideas why I see these problems with version 17.x?
Thanks for your help. 

Good Morning:
I am using the Treelist as an outliner.  My Treelist has a ParentID column which is SortIndex 0.  It also has a Display Order column which is sortindex 1
Problem:  I want to be able to promote a child node to the root note list --- which has no value on the ParentID. My attached Initial State screenshot shows the treelist before I attempt to promote a child.  So I edit the ParentID column by deleting the ParentID and leaving it blank.  See Editing Screenshot.  My expectation was that the edited node would assume its position as a top level node.    This does not work.  The Edit update adds back the original ParentID and the node (understandably) goes nowhere. See After Edit Update Screenshot.  Now things get real interesting.  If I Edit ParentID to 1 (there is no Node with a PointID of 1)  The update reflects the "1" but leaves the node where it was.  See Change Parent ID to 1 screenshot.  So I infer that the AspxTreeList is maintaining an invisible sort order list.    However, if I change ParentId to an existing top level node ID,  the Node gets moved to become a child of the newly designated top level node.  See Changing Parent ID to Existing PArentID and Result of Changing Parent ID to Existing.
Will you help me to understand what is going on behind the scenes and how I can edit a node to promote a child to the top level node collection?  Thanks!
 

In 16.x when loading a png to a button, if the image has transparency, it was honored. In the latest version, the transparency is rendered with what text.
See the attached demo  where on the TcxImage it is correct but on the TcxButton it is not rendered correctly.
 

Hi, 
I was wondering if there is a way to replace the cell double-click  event in the dxScheduler with a custom one?

Joar Olsen 

I bought 17.1.6 DXperience Subscription and it should be provided source code, but I could not find one.

Hi:
 To preserve the layout of my DataTable (Table1) which sorts rows by the row index rather than alphabetically, I'm handling the CustomFieldSort event like this:
        protected void myPivotGrid_CustomFieldSort(object sender, PivotGridCustomFieldSortEventArgs e)
        {
            e.Result = e.ListSourceRowIndex1.CompareTo(e.ListSourceRowIndex2);
            e.Handled = true;
        }
However, it doesn't group the rows of the first row field as it used to when using the default sort mode. So, how could I make it look like Table2?
Separately, using this same DataTable I'm following this article (
) to edit cells in my ASPxPivotGrid control, however, the PivotDrillDownDataSource object always returns a null row. What do I need to change to achieve this?
Table1:
                Col1   Col2    Col3
Row1        A        A         1
Row2       A        B         2
Row3       A        C          3
Row4       B        B         4
Row5       B        C         5
Row6       C        C         6 
Table2:
F1      F2        F3
A        A         1
          B         2
          C          3
B        B         4
           C         5
C        C         6  
PivotGrid fieds:
<dx:PivotGridField ID="F1" Area="RowArea" AreaIndex="0" FieldName="Col1" SortMode="Custom" Caption="" Options-AllowExpand="False" />
<dx:PivotGridField ID="F2" Area="RowArea" AreaIndex="1" FieldName="Col2" SortMode="Custom" Caption="" />
<dx:PivotGridField ID="F3" Area="DataArea" AreaIndex="0" FieldName="Col3" CellStyle-BackColor="White" CellFormat-FormatType="Numeric" Caption="" HeaderStyle-Wrap="True"/>
 

Quick question, 
I'm building a website using DevExtreme, angularjs, with datagrids and data sources. Is there an easy way to do an auto-refresh call either with the widget or the data source?
I have data that's feeding into a Sql table, and I want the Data grid to automatically refresh on a timer. 
Please reply to jbabey@swe.com

How do I set the background color of the footer cells.. I want to change these so they "pop" out more visually.
Screenshot of footer attached.
I want to do this programatically (not xaml).

Having just spent a 
 long time cussing and trying to add a control to a LayoutTable before finally noticing that LayoutMode=Table, could you please improve the designer to support TableLayout better!
1) Start with showing an overlay on the LayoutGroup its self, showing  the Rows and Columns.
2)  Dragging and Dropping should highlight the TableLayout cell being dragged over rather than the Regular drag drop hints
3) When two controls are in a Table Cell, this should be highlighted with help to, say, reduce the extended span of an existing control .

Hi. i have a backing table with some 'obsolete' values i cannot remove because used in the past. Those values are flagged as old.
In my XTragrid i have a repositorylookupedit populating from this table (ID - NAME). I want those values to be correctly shown in the grid but i do not want user to be able to see them  from popup and not even when typing in editor. I already managed to 'hide' them from popup using measureitem in a repositorycomboedit but there too user could select it by typing.
Any suggestion ? 
Thanks

I need to run some code on the server side but I need to see if the ASPxCardView is empty or has a record first..  How do I do that please.

This is a continuation from the ticket about displaying thousands of records. I have not implemented this grid yet. However, I think my process may be a little different than the demo and need assistance with it. I have a payroll report which utilizes a stored procedure to obtain it's data. It is then put through some functions to separate and combine entries that need separated or combined. Then, all that data is put into a list. The grid view will utilize that list to populate the columns. This is causing a big issue in performance. I wasn't sure if there was something that I could do utilizing the DevExpress GridView and LINQServerMode or not? I can't really upload the project though. 

Using the Web - Editor aspect of the Dashboard control, I can add a Textbox to my dashboard.  To this dashboard I can add N number of data bound values to it.  How can I access these Values in the textbox?  Additionally I would like to add the Parameters that were selected as well, to this textbox. I have researched and saw many ways to accomplish this in the WinForm version of the Dashboard, but none showed how to accomplish this for the Web version of the dashboard.  
To expound, I have the value of 
TotalSales (sum)   added to the Values section and then I have parameters of StartDate1 and EndDate 1 I would like to access as well, to present the line
The Total sales for the dates of +Start Date thru +EndDate1 was $+TotalSales (Sum)
Can you show me how to accomplish this
thank you

Hi,
We are using AllowHtmlString in a  LabelControl with html markup (for exampole <b>Bold</b>).
When we access the .Text property we get the text returned with html markup, which makes sense.
Is there a way to get the text without markup?
For example, LabelControl.CleanText = "Bold"?

Hi,
This is regarding the Checkbox Selector Column that we can activate in the Grid Control for Row Selection. As needed for this column to appear on the Grid, we use the following things : -
1. Set the GridControl SelectionMode = "MultipleRow"
2. Set the GridControl view (a TableView) ShowCheckBoxSelectorColumn = "True"
All looks pity fine and is working absolutely great till we hit this performance issue.
if in the Grid you have 
1. Lots of records (121842 Rows, 35 Columns)
2. Group by 4 - 5 columns (By Dragging columns to the Group Panel one by one)
3. Do a Full Expand (Using the Right Click on the Group Panel)
4. Collapse all groups except the Last One (Only highest level of Groups) (Manually clicking the collapse button on the top level group rows)
5. Click the Group Row Checkbox on the Last Group (This is the only group left which is full expanded( all nested groupings as well expanded))
The System hangs and the UI Freezes.
Kindly help.

I was wondering if there is a way to change the image being display in an ASPxButton control?
I need to display an image indicating how many items were selected... I know I can do this via a asp:multiview control and have 6 buttons queued up to change the display as the number of items change... not the preferred  method...
when I put in the command "ASPxButton.Image =" I get a message from the compiler that this is a read-only field during runtime ...
Is it possible via java?
or am I up the proverbial creek?

We built a Win forms Dashboard Designer app. The developer created the ribbon items by using the Make Ribbon command from the designer and then used code to remove selected items that we didn't want to let the end user access.
For some dashboards charts, we want to change some of the formatting/layout but our application doesn't seem to give us any way to do that. Please see the attached screenshot for an example of what we want to be able to change:
1) Center the chart title (Gauges 1) and increase its font size
2) Make the Y axis font bold 
In our app there doesn't seem to be a way to edit these properties of the chart. Based on your documentation, I tried to see if we had removed ribbon items related to Options or Properties but I don't see anything.
Please let me know how we can alter these chart items and/or how we  can enable editing them from our application.
Thank you in advance.

Hi,
I downloaded and installed the new version 17.2.5.
When i converted the project my toolbar menu don't show the newest version, only the oldest.
So im working in a 17.2.5 version, but in my toolbar menu show only 17.1
I need to uninstall all old version before install the new one?
 

Hi,
I can't open some of my View Controllers in Design View;  I get the following error:
Severity Code Description Project File Line Suppression State
Message The designer must create an instance of type 'DevExpress.ExpressApp.ViewController`1[[DevExpress.ExpressApp.ListView, DevExpress.ExpressApp.v17.2, Version=17.2.5.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b88d1754d700e49a]]' but it cannot because the type is declared as abstract. 0 
This does not happen on all View Controllers, but it is happening on quite a few.  
What does this mean and how can I fix it? 

Example:
 
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open and run the example app.
2. In the data grid labeled " Memory Data Source" click one of the 'Delete' buttons.
3. Wait a second. Note that at no point does the grid's loading panel appear.
 4. In the confirmation dialog select 'Yes' or 'No' .
5.  In the data grid labeled " HTTP Data Source" click one of the 'Delete' buttons.
3. Wait a second. 
I expect that these two grids should act the same and to 
 show the loading panel while the delete confirmation dialog is open since they both have their dataSource set to a component member of type `Group[]` with the only difference being how that array is populated.

I have the following statement in my page:
<Toolbars>
       <dx:GridViewToolbar ItemAlign="Right" Name="DeleteToolbar">
             <Items>
                 <dx:GridViewToolbarItem Command="Custom" Name="DeleteRow" Text="Delete" Image-IconID="edit_delete_16x16" Enabled="false" />
             </Items>
         </dx:GridViewToolbar>
</Toolbars>
I also have a clientside event as listed:
<ClientSideEvents RowClick="OnRowClick" ToolbarItemClick="OnDeleteClick" />
My RowClick event should enable the delete toolbar.  what am I doing wrong??? (Also, how do I change the Icon)
function OnRowClick(s, e) {

Hello,
I have a dashboard that has just recently begun to throw the following error when we attempt to render it from a browser:

How do I determine the root cause of this error?

Hello,
Within the new version of Devexpress 17.2.5 we have experienced a  doted lines on the produced preview (See screenshot).
While in 17.1.0 it was not visible.  Furthermore a user is able to change a margin.
How to remove those doted line and prevent user to modify a content of the document? 
Cheers

We have a Nav bar drop down menu and we would like to add a sub menu or nested drop down inside the main drop down. How we we accomplish this?

Please advise on how can we have a button instead of the "+" icon to insert a new row in Dev Extreme Data Grid.

So it looks like PreviewRow is the closest I can get to what I want, unless I'm missing something somewhere.
I am basically looking to be able to insert a row that has a colspan of all columns.
I think the issue with PreviewRow is that it's going to more than likely add a preview to every row - so it may not actually be the best choice - but unless there's a column span option that I'm just missing or not seeing for some reason...
The behavior that I want would be *similar* to (but not)  Grouping rows. I'm creating a chat module, and after some testing, I think a grid is the best means of display for me. But what I want is to be able to have 1 row for each date with a colspan of 100% that has a date, and then "normal" rows that have multiple columns that fall under that date.
Is there some way to make this happen with a gridcontrol?

Hi 
By customizing the dxDatagrid delete button, the width of the grid titles does not match the width of the columns in the rows. See the following capture
In previuos version working fine.
I use 16.2.12 version of devextreme

Hi DevExpress,
I'm using the DateEditPickerStyleSettings and I have defined the MaxValue - Property and I wanted to ask you if it is possible to hide values outside of MaxValue?

Hi there,
I am hopping you can help me find a devExpress solution to my current issue.  I have a combobox that I populate with a display member and a value member. 
The display member text looks like "Smith, John    |     John.Smith@oregonstate.edu"
The value member is just the email text          "John.Smith@oregonstate.edu" 
My issue is with suggest/append
Folks have asked to have the suggest text, that pops when they start typing in the combo box, find all text matches to suggest.
For example, if I type "John" in the combobox it will suggest all entries that have "John" somewhere in the display member text and not just what the text starts with.
I have seen the devexpress asp .net combobox that appears to have this behavior illustrated in the link below but it unclear to me how to do this in vb.net win forms. Is this possible with any of the DevExpress combo boxes using VB.net and Win forms? 
The first example showing Incremental filtering is what I would like to create for vb.net winforms
Thank you,
Jesse 

Hi,
Is there some built-in method for preventing 2 different users viewing the same object in Detail View  at the same time?
e.g. when working down a list view and user1 opens Object1, is there some way of prevent User2  from opening the Object1 until User1 closes Object1?

Hi
We have migrated our DevExpress version from 17.2.4 to 17.2.5
Before doing the migration we were able to create executable files; and those files were  distributed into our Client?s PC; and we were able to run the application there.
Now, after downloading the upgrade, the application (exe file created under 17.2.5) is not running anymore. The appication asks for the initial login screen, but after doing entering the user & password the application suddenly stops running and no further application screens are displayed. 
Please take in consideration that in a previous ticket, you suggested us: "
 " We did that when we had the 17.2.4 version and we solved the problem that time, but now with the 17.2.5 version we started having the same problem again.
We understand that the executable files created with the license can be re-distributable to other clients or machines without requiring additional licenses.  I?m attaching a file with some screens displaying the error, I hope it helps you to find the solution to our problem. 
We require your support to make us run that file in other machines. If we are still missing something please let us know. Many thanks in advance for your response.

Hi
I did like this example
but when i export excel its not merge cells on excel.
How can i horizontally  merge cells on excel?

I have HTML & javascript codes as below to generate a percent type control using dxNumberBox widget. Here is the issues I got:
1. I set maxlength = 16 but it let me enter 17 even 18 characters. 
2. Can't use Del on NumLock area to delete a digit.
3. After pressing Del on NumLock area at floating point, I cannot enter any digits after the point anymore.
4.  $("#it-percent").dxNumberBox("instance").option("value") return empty sometimes if I also call this $("#it-percent").dxValidator("validate").isValid before getting value.
Please check. Thanks & regards.
For your information, I am using Jquery-3.2.1.js, IE 11.

I'm experiencing problems with tabbing between cells in the MVC GridView in IE 11.  We have the following editor settings:
settings.SettingsEditing.Mode = GridViewEditingMode.Batch;
settings.SettingsEditing.BatchEditSettings.EditMode = GridViewBatchEditMode.Cell;
settings.SettingsEditing.BatchEditSettings.StartEditAction = GridViewBatchStartEditAction.Click;
And some clientside events wired up, which log their actions to the console.  When tabbing between two cells, the sequence of clientside event calls seems to be broken in IE 11.
In chrome, when tabbing from a cell called POSCompanyName to one called POSCompanyAddress , I see the event sequence as
onFocusedCellChanging: POSCompanyAddress
onFocusedCellChanging: cancelEvent: false
OnBatchEditEndEditing: currentColumnName: POSCompanyName
OnBatchEditStartEditing: POSCompanyAddress
The end result is that the focus and editor moves to the next cell.
But in IE 11 the event sequence is wrong (see attachment), and the end result is that the editor is lost and cell focus stays on the original cell.  This has been reproduced by multiple users.  Disabling all our clientside events makes no difference.
Is this a known issue: is there anything we can do?
 

Hi, 
I would like to programmatically select a row and scroll to this row when the content is ready. I saw many posts on this issue on the forum about scroll to the selected row. I had tried all of them.

I create a few docking controls at run time, and use layout controls for managing the editors. When they are displayed at run time, and the control is larger vertically than the docking area, the scroll bar on the layout control is at the bottom. I would like to display it so it is at the top.
How do I do that? 

I need to create a customer proposal master document which consists of multiple parts which can change with each project. Here are the main sources:
- RTF text with merge fields - this would be the covering letter

- Word documents (docx)
- PDF files  
- Image files 
What would be the best way to approach this? 

I am creating a simple report which produces a list of products. There is a field against the product called Last Issue which is a datetime field. What I want to do in the criteria of the report is only show products where the Last Issue date is older than a year. I can add a criteria where I manually set the date to 01/02/2017 and this works fine. However, I need to enter an expression such as DateTime.Today.AddMonths(-12). However, I cannot see a way of entering this and getting the system to accept. I am sure I can do this in code with the CriteriaOperator but I would like to achieve this in the Report Designer, without using any code. Is this possible?

So I've created a few reports using your report wizard.  I'm grabbing the report and instantiating it in code, but I'd also like to change the connection string based the machine I'm running from.   All the examples I'm seeing involve an XtraReport object that is created in code. I saw a post about a report being serialized, but the example used an xml file for reference in making adjustments to its settings and I don't have that available.  I have a couple CS files and an RESX file.
When I reassign the data source, I actually get the right connection string in the connection properties, but the report returns without data.  There seems to be some differences in some of the properties when I reassign the data source manually.  I think I'm close to having the right solution, but I'm just missing something simple.

Hello,
I'm trying to get the command edit button's appearance to be determined by a css class. No matter what I try, I am getting the default (underlined text) appearance. Here are the relevant settings:
     settings.SettingsCommandButton.EditButton.Styles.Style.CssClass = "gridEditButton";
    settings.CommandColumn.Visible = true;
    settings.CommandColumn.ShowEditButton = true;
    settings.CommandColumn.FixedStyle = GridViewColumnFixedStyle.None;
    settings.CommandColumn.VisibleIndex = settings.Columns.Count;
and here is the css class:
.gridEditButton {
    background-image: url("Images/Buttons/GridEditButtonSprite.png") !important;
    margin: 0 auto !important;
    width: 16px !important;
    height: 16px !important;
    cursor: pointer !important;
}
I added the !important at the recommendation of other support tickets I saw. And yes, the image exists in that location.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks!
 

I'm looking at the ASPxCalendar control here :
.
I was wondering how I can have the control look like that.
I want to remove the borders and have a bit of separation between the months  (I've attached how I want it to look like (Capture.png)).
Another question, is there a way to decrease the font (or the overall size of the control).
In 1 column, 2 rows mode using my screen, the control isn't fully appearing (attached screenshot : MyScreen.png).

Hi,
we have verified an error exporting large datasets in server mode grid.
This is the scenario:
We have a query that extract from a "SQL Server 2012 Standard" 290K records, and the application compiled at 32bits stops working, for memory issue.
We used an  EntityServerModeSource, this is my export code:




I've attached the screenshot of memory situation.
Seems that the ExportToXls method write all record in memory before writing on the excel file.

Dear Support Team,
I am running one application where i used two gridlookups based on the first selection second is populating.
Now the issue is when change first gridlookups selection then i see in server side code selected value is not the order which i selected there.
Below is one scenario: When page loads first gridlookup selecting first value by default. Now unselect first value and select second and third value.
I check this in my second gridlookup init method when getting value of gridlookup1  getting selected order of value. Now uncheck all value on fly and then select third item the second item in that case when see again in init method of gridlookup2 you can see there the select value is still accepting the previous selected order not the current order.
For understanding purpose i attached one sample project here.
Please let me know if you have any concern.
Thanks,

Hi,
I'm building a WinForm Custo mPropertyEditor to edit a property that is of a XPObjectBase descendant type.
I'm using IComplexViewItem interface to get the ObjectSpace and work with that session.
The object I'm editing is not in an aggregated relation with the parent, is a 1 to 1 relation. 
I would like to know if there is an easy way to be notified of the save/delete events of the parent object  to handle the save/delete on the object edited in my custom property editor.

Is there a way to force SelectBox to reload data from the DataSource? I am looking something like the refresh method of DataGrid (I have a similar situation like the on described in the link: 
)
but with SelectBox not Grid.
 

Hi,
I'm editing an object (typeA) where I'd like to have a property of another XPObjectBase descendant (typeB) .
If I put the Aggregated attribute on the simple Property (not a collection) of typeB, the model of the typeA is created without that specific property but with many properties (the properties of the typeB class).
This way I can't develop a Custom Property Editor for editing in a special UI way the typeB .
Have you got any suggestion on how can I handle a One to One aggregated relation?

Hi,

The report is shown correctly when the program is executed, but this warning message is always shown during compilation. Is this something I should care or should I just ignore it?
 Could you please help me find what is going on here?

Hello,
I am using TdxUIAdornerManager with TdxGuide. Which is great. But for end users who are not  familiar with the concept, it is difficult to close the guide"form". Maybe they did not know to use the "esc" key. Two options are nice to have:
1.  The esc key shoud also work, if a guide-control is visible/active.
2. If the user clicks outside a guide (but in the gray area), the form should also close (Active=False).

Hi,
We are getting unexpected timeout errors when uploading large files, and I'm at a loss to understand why. But because the ASPxUploadControl is effectively a black-box (we don't have the source), then I will ask to clarify that it behave the way I think it should.
So, the timeout on our site is 40 minutes:
The ASPxUploadControl is nothing too exciting, but here it is:
As far as I know, any chatter to the backend (callback or postback) should "reset" the session timeout of 40 minutes, since it is set to have a sliding expiration. And since the DX upload control is updating the progress panel via callbacks, then it seems like it shouldn't matter how large the upload file is. In other words, if the file was so large, that it takes  an hour to upload, it shouldn't be impacted by the session timeout since many callbacks would be happening to update that progress bar.
Can you confirm if the above behaviour is correct so I can rule out the upload control itself causing the timeouts?
regards,
-randall sell 

Hi
I have a gird columns which has a combo box repository and where I filter on display text. The display text is a string for example product name while the real value is a number product_number. So when user makes a filter for example 'Product name like 'somevalue%' it is really product_number in (1,2,3 etc) or something similar.
I need to save this filter so when a user request the data again I bring only the data he has filtered. 
So, I need to get the  real value filter form current filter.

Hello support team,
I have a problem with a pretty trivial situation: There is a BarManager on the form. The menu bar has one sub menu (BarSubItem) with one sub button in this menu (BarButtonItem), e.g. File / Open. This item is set visible or hidden depending on user rights. When hidden I also want to hide the menu since it has no more visible sub items. How can I achieve this behaviour?
I tried (and it doesn't work): 
I also tried the 11 years old solution provided for this purpose in 
 (and it doesn't work as well):
Is there still no easier solution, e.g. a HideItemIfEmpty property?
Thank you!

Hi there,
I have developed a software with "Material"  theme to give pages a mobile app look. It works fine and no one complains about anything. :)
 Now I'd like to add more mobile feel to it by using mobile jquery like:
$.mobile.changePage('myPage.aspx',{transition:'slide'});
to make this happen, I have to add 
 (and of course jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js) to my project. By doing that, all the DevExpress components get messed up. Both the look and functionality. I was wondering if there is any way to fix this or use a workaround to navigate into different pages with sliding or ... effect.
thanks.

Hello support team,
Once more I need your assistance. In WinExplorerView I have a grouping e.g. by name alphabetically. I would like to show the number of group items in the group header row, e.g. "A (10 items)". I think I know where to do it (in the CustomDrawGroupItem event) but I don't know how to get the number of items.In other support cases on this topic there is said to use "gridView.GroupSummary" but the WinExplorerView doesn't expose such a property. How can I achieve this?
Thank you!

I have a grid where I am setting the NonColumnFilter based on user selections.  the initial filter was being set before the grid was bound to a datasource, then as the user makes changes to the filter selections the filter was was overwritten with the new values.  In 14.2 this worked but after upgrading to 17.x the initial filter is set correctly but any subsequent changes to the filter end up as a combination of the new filter and the initial filter.
IE.  Initial filter - Status ="1"   if the user selects to filter on Status = "2" the new filter ends up as   Status = "1" and Status = "2"
If I change my code to make sure the initial filter is applied after the grid is bound to the datasource then this does not happen.

Hi Devexpress team
I need your help urgently please.
I used version 14 + till last year and then upgraded to 17. x and are now on 17.2.5. Before the upgrade everything where working perfect until I did the upgrade. I attached a sample project and a SQL 2012 database for you to test. Let me explain my issue.
I have different institution that use my application and I have a letterhead that are created when they click a button. The report is linked to sql and all the information for the letterhead  and letter is supplied via stored procedure. When I am designing the report and click the preview button everything is 100% and you can see the logo on the letterhead(I added a image in the zip file). When I run the app and press the button the pdf is created and all are there except the logo. Originally my image was on the server and I used the ImageUrl and now I saved the image in the database and exactly the same is happening.
Please check my sample project and see if you can find the problem.
Thanks 

It seems like I've had this issue before and it had to do with the dataset.  The dropdowns for the tblBeds selection are not working properly.  I expect the "True", "False" as was in the original item selected.
Thanks 

Hello
I have a SuperToolTip with a html-link attached to a BarButtonItem in my RibbonControl. If I place the BarButtonItem directly in the ribbon the link works just fine but if I place that same button in a menu (in a BarSubItem) the HyperlinkClicked-event doesn't fire. I can see the tooltip and the link appears to be clickable but the event wont fire. Is there any way I can get the html-link to work when the button is inside the menu?
Thank you
 

Hello,
As can be seen from the attached image, I changed the size of the toolbar of document viewer. How can I vertically center the buttons and labels of toolbar? 

Hi,
I'm using the TcxTreeList to list layers, like in a CAD software.
In the first column I list the layers. In the second column I have added an icon that shows / hides each layer when I click on it, so that I can control their status. So far, It works very well.
Now, from the header I already manage all the layers all together. For instance, clicking on the header in the second column I can show or hide ALL the layers, instead of just one. This help me to avoid to show / hide them clicking one by one.
The only issue is that I don't know how to change the icons to the whole column. I tried to use OnCustomDrawDataCell with OnMouseUp and OnMouseDown with no luck.
Could you help me to achieve the result?
Please see the screenshot.
I? look forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,

Hi, I'm facing a really strange issue that is appearing only in 
. Everything is working correctly in Chrome.
I'm having an application page in SharePoint 2013 that is using ASPxGridView in batch mode to edit data. I'm using cascade comboboxes and also "looking for records" with the ItemRequestedByValue and ItemsRequestedByFilterCondition. In Combobox column when I start to write a text to be looked up in the database, callback appears on the server (code-behind), wait indicator is displayed on client, but before the callback ends, the edit mode is interrupted (switched to non edit mode) and combobox is empty. Any other attempt to filter the data does not event show the load indicator though the callback is sent to the server and processed. It's really strange but I'm sure it can be solved.
Can you help me with that? 

Awhile back, DevExpress helped me with some code to implement incremental search inside a TcxLookupComboBox.
I wanted to avoid retyping that code, so I created a procedure that I could call in a separate .pas unit.
Inside that procedure, the Delphi inherited command does not compile, and I wonder if it is ok to leave it out or if that creates any memory or other runtime issues.
Below is the procedure code with the inherited command commented out. It compiles and seems to work ok at runtime.
Would you mind having a look and letting me know if it is ok to omit the inherit command in this case, or if not, what is a work around?  
Thanks!!



Hi,
I'm trying to accomplish the following task in XAF.
I have a business object "Printer Settings" . I would like users to select a printer from the printers list and then based on that selection allow user to choose PaperSource for that printer.
I've created 2 custom editors derived from StringPropertyEditor:
1. Shows list of Installed Printers
2. Shows list of available PaperSource for selected printer.
In second property editor's SetupRepositoryItem method, I need to get access to currently selected Printer in the first property editor, but can't figure out how.
Thanks,
Alex 

In the old scheduler the event for appointment changes included the objects which had changed.
The new scheduler just fires a generic event.
What's the migration guidance here?
Is my only option to attach to the  AppointmentItems.CollectionChanged event?
Also, no 'Image' mapping on the Resource?  How do I specify the image?
By the way, the migration doc on the topic of the mappings seems wrong -> CustomFieldMappings should be children of the AppointmentMappings object, but the migration guidance document has both AppointmentMappings and CustomFieldMapping as direct children of the Datasource.AppointmentMappings property.
Thanks!

If you use the Copy Predefined Report action on an inplace report, the report cache is not reset, you have to close the application to see the new report.

Hello,
I was testing a Web page with different Browsers that I had only used IE with before.
What I found was a difference in behavior with IE and Firefox vs Chrome and Edge.
I have a Popup that I share a lot of pages with. When the popup is closing I do 2 things.
In JavaScript, first I kill the Popup's Url and then I clean up some Session vars on the server.
In IE and Firefox this goes to the server "only" for the callback. But in Chrome and Edge it goes
to the server twice. First for the popup's url or whatever, not as a postback or callback, and
then secondly to the server to kill the session vars.
I happened to see the problem because on the server-side a have a Page_PreRender Sub that
has call that Cleans out all variables, i.e. a clean slate. I have that in place trusting that it only ever 
gets hit the very 1st time the page renders but with Chrome and Edge that's not the case???
 
Is this a bug? 
Thanks, Jack
This is the javascript , again in IE and Firefox you only go to the server for the PerformCallback
but in Chrome and Edge you 1st go to the server for the Popup before going back for the PerformCallback. 
ShareThePop_JS.SetContentUrl( "" );
ShareThePop_JS.RefreshContentUrl();
ChartsCBPanel_JS.PerformCallback( "KillTheSessionVars:Mech" );
 

What is the difference between
Dev Express Visual Studio components .
Dev Express Express editions.
Dev Express Universal version.
I need to upgrade the Dev Express VS component 15.1 to 15.2.17. But our company has got license of 15.2.4 VS component version. And other is 15.2.17 or 17.1 Dev Express Express version. 

Can you point me to an example of how to reject changes in the DropRecord event handler?
I noticed a PreviewDrop event.  Maybe I put code in there to evaluate the drop and then I can reject it there?  But I don't know what code to put there to prevent the DropRecord code from running.
Case: the user is dragging an item from a GridControl to a TreeListControl.   I need to evaluate what node the item is dropped on and then accept the drop or reject it. 
Thanks. 

Hi,
After  i have upgraded to version 17.2.4.0, the chart on the report is empty!!!

Dear Support,
I have a container in the template designer bound to a view on my data base. I can see the shapes being populated.
  when a user click on a container  - how can I get the content of a field in the selected container?
Thanks and Regards, Izak.

Dear Support,
we are evaluating the use of the diagram control in our application.
I have a container in the template designer bound to a view on my data base. I can see the shapes being populated.
however, all the shapes are displayed based on the "Layout Kind" setting. meaning in a single line/row...
I would like the background to be production floor layout image and the containers that are loaded from the database, I'd like to position (based on each container content) on a specific location on the canvas (i.e. the production floor image in the background).
is this implementation possible with diagram control if so, do you have sample demonstrating how to achieve this?
Thanks and Regards, Izaks.
  

Hi,
       how to change the editorType from "dxTextBox" to "dxSelectBox" for a formitem when i change value in another formitem in dxForm.
Example : 
var employee = {"ID": 1, "Position": "CEO", "EmployeeList ":""};
         var positions = ["CEO","Employee"];
         
         $(function(){
            $("#form").dxForm({
                colCount: 2,
                formData: employee,
                items: ["ID", {
                        dataField: "Position",
                        editorType: "dxSelectBox",
                        editorOptions: { 
                            items: positions,
 onValueChanged: function (e) { // to reload sub types when there is a change in type
 var EmpSelectBox = $("#form").dxForm("instance").getEditor("Employee");
          if(e.value == "CEO")
          {
          EmpSelectBox.option("editorType", "dxTextBox");
          EmpSelectBox.option("value", "NAME of CEO");
          } 
          else
          {
          EmpSelectBox.option("editorType", "dxSelectBox");
          EmpSelectBox.option("items", ["name1","name2"]);
          }                            
 }
                        },
                    
                },"Employee"
                ]
            });
         });
when i select CEO in position Employee should be a TextBox and when i select  EmployeeList in position formitem Employee formitem should be select and user able to select values from dropdown.
Please suggest how to achieve  this functionality.

Do you have any ideas?

I want to use flyoutpanel to simulate a popup menu, because i want to add some sepecial items in it. for example, i want to add a search box to filter the menu items. so i create a flyout panel, set it close outer click to true. it works but some small problems.
1. if it popup, i can't close the form directly(to close form, first click hide the flyoutpanel, second click close the form). i think the flyoutpanel hide the click event for parent form. 
2. the same as first one, i want to show the flyoutpanel again when i click in the form.but in this case, it just hide the flyoutpanel.
the demo is my example code, thank you.
 

Hi,
Having looked at the two samples for Master Detail for the ASPxGridView I feel the solutions are quite strange. 
Since you use global variables to store the IDs of the masterGrid, how come there isnt a method for that to extract the ID upon expanding the row, so that you don't have to handle that in each detail control? This is especially cumbersome as it seems only the ASPxGridView seemt to expose a usable function for this, GetMasterRowKeyValue().

Hi Team,
In my project I am having the scenario as described below.
Scenario :
1.  I am using a dropdownbox with treeview template which loads the data from webapi service.
2. The data will have a boolean field as 'IsSelected' .
3.  When loading the page it will call the webapi service method and loads data to the dropdownbox.
4.  If the above said field has data 'true' then checkbox for that item should be checked in the treeview and  also the text should get displayed in the 
       dropdownbox editor during the initial load.
Kindly provide me an example for this.
Regards,
Sneha

Hi,
In the Pivot Grid, the user can filter various parameters and move data fields.
Is there a way for the user to save the such settings in Pivot Grid?
If yes, can such save settings be shared with others users using the same Pivot Grid.
For example, one user save the Pivot Grid setting with Year : 2017.  One returning to the Pivot Grid (same web page) the user can re-call the Year setting.
Thanks for assistance.

I have a DevExtreme dxPopup Widget where the  MVCxDocumentViewer is contained (as partial view).
The partial view with the report viewer is called by 
call.
Now I try to customize the ribbon as it is described 
.
Because of the popup widget and the AJAX request I cannot place another element within the same partial view as the report viewer.
Is there a way to adapt the ribbon by the 'PreRender' event handler?

Hi,
We have a grid where we conditionally show the PreviewRow based on a checkbox. The code that "flips" the rendering is on a custom callback for the gr id:
This works correctly for the first few pages, but on about the 3rd or 4th dynamic loading of data, it seems to forget how the ShowPreview is set, and will revert to however it is defined at design-time. I've tested this with the normal Page mode, and also as EndlessPaging - both display the bad behaviour.
I can work around this bug by re-assigning it like so:
 So my question is, is this a known bug? Or am I not understanding something fundamental whereby you expect the ShowPreview to revert to it's design-time state when EndlessPaging is used?
Keep in mind... We are using an old version of DX (2014.1.13), so this may be a bug that's been fixed.
Advise?

Hello,
Last week, due to problems with Visual Studio 2017, I had to format my hard drive. As I have projects created with Visual Studio 2008 and Devexpress 8.3.6 I have also installed it from scratch. Since then I have problems with all the projects that use Devexpress 8.3.6. When I add any new devexpress control in a previously created form I get this error: 
The existing forms that I have edited after installing Devexpress from scratch do not open and I am getting the error. I can not continue designing any form. Only I can open forms that I have created / modified before the new installation Devexpress (before last week).
Before reinstalling Devexpress I could work correctly with the projects and this error did not appear.
Any idea how to solve this? 

I am trying to integrate Twilio functionality into a scheduling application build on xaf.  I would like to have a multiple selection on the list view that I can submit to a custom action to call the Twilio API.  How can the multiple selection and action be best implemented in XAF?  Thank you in advance.

Hello.
I have code in my xaml 
:
When I trying to run my application with this page - all content from window are dissappeared.
If i delete blocks of code with "<dxmvvm:Interaction.Behaviors>" tags - all works fine.
So, is that problem on your's side or i'm doing wrong?

Please refer to the file "Column Ordering Issue Sample.docx" which is part of the attached sample solution.  It gives all the details and how to use the sample application to show my issue.
In brief, prior to version 17.2, I was able to bind my custom column definition Order property to the grid's VisibleIndex and thus set ordering, along with the visibility, grouping, sorting and widths.
As of 17.2, that no longer works.  Binding to VisibleIndex does nothing.  I spent a week reworking my application to come up with another method for obtaining the s ame control over ordering/visibility.  However, in the end I need assistance in:
1. How to continue to use a single set of column definitions across multiple grids, as I currently do.
2.  How to update visiblity and ordering in a way that the grid can use without stomping over other grids.  I do this from within a custom column chooser and within a custom grid descendant upon receipt of "things have changed" messenger message.
3.  The proper event to use or event to handle to detect when I should invoke my ordering/visibility code.
4. Whether using the table view's UseLegacyColumnVisibleIndexes is a viable long-term solution
Again, please see the doc for details.  I need more formatting capability than this support question provides.
Thank you.
 

Hi,
We have an expression editor tied to an umbound pivot field.
On the development machine, there is no issue - i am able to right-click on the field and open the expression editor.
On the installed product, the program crashes.  i have installed all Devex Dlls used in the project - compared it to my release/bin folder .
Specifically, DevExpress.Xpf.Core.v17.2.dll is present in the installed folder.  Product version is 17.2.5.0  
I wish I could reproduce in a test project.  it is working on my dev machine.
I'm not able to figure out what could be causing this.

I have an issue where I cannot seem to get display format of dates for Australian culture.
In my shared view I have this JavaScript code.
Than in my other view which is using this shared view I do a call like this...
However, the date box keeps the usual american culture which is, I suppose, default for your controls.
Am I understanding this right....If I load locale via Globalize, than all of the devextreme controls should use it out of the box or do I have to explicitly state this somewhere.

Currently I am using your WinForms - but will be upgrading to the Universal in a month.  Since that includes everything - I am hoping you might have something along the lines of what I will detail below - that I could customize to fit my needs...
I am dealing with datasets and datatables in .Net WinForms .  My application will be constantly creating and destroying DataTables in a particular DataSet.  I have no control over what the end user will be doing here so they can be filled with data from any number of sources - and I do not even have much control over the names. :)    We allow the users to query data, which generates a DataTable in the DataSet - but we also allow them to pull in data from CSV files and other sources - which also create DataTables in the DataSet.  
Now what I would like to be able to do is to provide a visual representation of the current state of a DataSet to the end user.  It would show the Data Tables and their names (fields would be nice - but not necessary I think).  It would be nice if it looked a little bit like the DataSet Designer in Visual Studio - in terms of showing a graphic representation of the DataTables - but I am flexible here.  
At this point I am looking at just providing a read only visual representation - but might later want to add in some functionality to allow the users to record some relationships between the DataTables. 
I am using WinForms - with standard DataSets - and DataTables.   I think I had seen some demo videos (?) of your DataAccess capabilities of your XAF components.  Maybe I am wrong - but might that be something that would work?  Would it work with standard DataSet/DataTable components?
Are there components (or something that I could use to get started) that DevExpress provides?   If not - are you aware of anyone else who might provide this particular type of component?  
thank you

Hi,
I want to export a csv file which includes only selection in spreadsheet control. The main problem we are facing is we are not able to ignore a column if it stays among other colums. I have a List<Range> which is correctly selects what i want but we cannot find a way to export as csv file. How can we solve this problem ?
Some code parts not worked  :
1.) Tried to copy selection in newly created worksheet
2.) Also tried to change export settings.

Hi DevExpress Team

I?m using information about a few links from DevExpress

Hello,
We have a number of DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReports that are currently working fine, however, when we make any change to a report then try to generate it we receive a MissingManifestResourceException.
Please see full exception below:
"An exception of type 'System.Resources.MissingManifestResourceException' occurred in mscorlib.dll but was not handled in user code
Additional information: Could not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or the neutral culture.  Make sure "ReportName" was correctly embedded or linked into assembly "Project" at compile time, or that all the satellite assemblies required are loadable and fully signed."
Our XtraReport's are version 13.2 and following code retrieves the report resources:
System.Resources.ResourceManager resources = global::Resources.InitialMeetingWithNewFamilyForm.ResourceManager;
When we make change to the XtraReports the version changes automatically to 17.1 and the code changes to:
System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager resources = new System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager(typeof(ReportName));
The file structure of of our XtraReports:
- Report and resource file (without designer file) in same folder
- Another resource file (with designer file) in App_GlobalResources
Do you know why this exception is occurring and how we can fix it?

Hi,
A big problem working with the ASPxGridView EditFormTemplates is that you no longer can access the controls within the EditFormTemplate from code but have to do A LOT of  FindEditFormTemplateControl() every time you go into edit mode. Is there no way around that? What are recommended ways of working with a compled EditFormTemplate?

Hi
In order for Unbound coumns to be restored from a saved layout, we need to set
But overtime I may add new columns to the dataset and I dont want these new columns to be automatically added to the view when restoring a layout that does not have these columns.
If I put the AddNewColumns to false, then the new columns will not be part of the view but my unbound columns either.
Anyway to solve this ?

Hello,
I want to copy an  TcxGridChartView (via bitmap) to TdxSpreadSheet (in picture container). It works fine with column-charts, but with line-, area- and pie-charts the captions and axis are missing (not displayed, maybe white). With TdxRichEdit, lines are working fine. Check sample.

Hi
I removed the  <property name="Caption"> from the XML layout.
When restoring, the Caption is reset to FieldName
I did the same for ToolTip. After restoring the layout, the ToolTip still has the value it had before the restore.
Why is the Caption not working the same way ?
I was expecting that if a property is not in the XML layout that the property would keep its current value.
I have a few properties that I set automatically when the grid loads.
For instance, the Tooltip comes from a table.
If I change aToolTip in the table I want this updated Tooltip to always show in the views. I dont want the old tooltips in the layout to be used. 
That is why I remove the ToolTip property from the layout automatically before saving it.
It works for ToolTip but not for Caption.
Is there a workaround ?
Am I correct in assuming that if a property in not in the layout that this property will keep its current value after the layout is restored ?

How can I customize the batch editing buttons that are created in the grid header toolbar?
I need to change the icons and sizes.
 

I would like to know if it is possible and if so how to setup a page that would have say a grid or table 4 x 3  in size that contains an image from a particular folder that when clicked would show either an image gallery or image slider of all images that are in the folder from which the image was clicked. In essence, the initial view would contain 12 images from 12 different folders with say the first image from each folder shown.

Hello Support,
Before showing report, we have  one page which asks user to select date range of which he wants to see report. So on this page user will have to input i.e. from-date and to-date
Now our requirement is to show inputs given in from-date and to-date on generated report header with big fonts like 
"Report generated for 01-Jan-2018 TO 01-Feb-2018"
I have taken care of applying filter string to data source, but still looking for ways for how to show such filter-string like above on report.
 Can you please highlight any approach through which I can implement above requirement ?
Thank You.

It does not work in my app.
Is there some special setup  to achieve these effects?
is missing some code behind? 

See screenshot. When I use the mobile app in a browser, the icons show fine. When I install using PhoneGap, the icons show as three periods.

I set the format to "M/dd/yy", but the DateTime value in the box displays both the date and the time. Attached are images of (1) the design time settings, and (2) the runtime display.
Attached is the form as displayed at runtime. I'll send a comment or new ticket with an image of the design time settings.

I seem to have hit a wall to get my scheduler to work using FetchAppointment delegate and a checkboxList to filter resources. I am following E4717  and  E4130.
In the case of "filtering resources via checkbox list " the code example shows the following

Sorry to barge in on someone else's Q but why does EndlessPaging require a client-side solution? Is it completely impossible to set the FocusRowIndex to a value (say 1) when using EndlessPaging? I choose 1 because there will be at least 2 (or more then likely) rows.
 The

DevX Version : 16.2.4
Windows 10
Good Afternoon,
I am running into a very similar issue when using the ReportPrintTool.PrintDialog();
If i call this in Debug mode it works fine.  However in Release mode it causes the Application to crash.
The Reports that I am printing contain no Scripting at all.
I see no properties in the report or the printing tool to set the above mentioned values.
I did attempt to modify the App.Config file as stated above to no avail either (Although this could be because it was not nested correctly).
Could you point me to an example showing how to rectify this please.
Also does the latest version of DevEx eliminate this issue?
Thank you,

Dear All,
I have a Mvc form which has multiselect gridlookup edit. To select record we must use mouse to open and select items. Is there any way to open gridlookup when i focused that control and auto focus to search panel or any best practice to use this control without using mouse. 

Dear Sirs,
We migrated our larger project (dynamic link library - DLL) from C++ Builder XE6 to C++ Builder 10.2 Tokyo. To Tokyo IDE we installed your components in last available version. Everything works fine except one thing - all forms (descendants of TdxRibbonForm)  have a ribbon with a wrong style in runtime - it looks like style "rs2007" is applied but all ribbons are set to use rs2010 style. In design time everything looks fine. When we set Ribbon to styles rs2007,rs2013,rs2016 or rs2016tablet - everything works fine in runtime only rs2010 is not working. Do you know where can be a problem and what we can do to fix it? Thank you for information.
We also imported our another project (dynamic link library - DLL) with one ribbon and in this project is everything ok.

I'm having this same issue and the link that you provided doesn't work to fix. The OP is speaking of looking at a DetailView of an object that implements IResource. This shows a scheduler at the bottom of the DetailView, but it isn't recognized by XAF as a ListView when implementing a controller. This is a single object with the Scheduler control at the bottom.
How do you gain access to the Scheduler control in the DetailView of a Resource?

Ok, I see the treeview and menuoptions now.
Now, the question is I am rendering this on a desktop in Chrome browser. And I believe swipe is a mobile action. 
How can I achieve this -

2. Show a switch button to go back and forth 
I thought these are set by default. If not, how can I set it.  

Hello,
I'm migrating an old project to use XAF.
I've created a code-first from database EF assembly which contains  the business class to access my existing database.
I've referenced this data model assembly into the XAF's main module, renamed the HashSet to List etc.
So far, I can access data in a list view.
As Visual studio wizard to import the database was not aware of all field names, I got some properties with unusefull names like Contact and Contact 1 for two references to a Contact table (i.e. Contact is in fact SalesContact and Contact1 is TechnicalContact), so I renamed the virtual properties in the code-first model.
My problem is that whatever I try, XAF's BO model continues to have  two items named Contact and Contact1. I was expecting that after a rebuild and UpdateModel I would see SalesContact and TechnicalContact.
Also I made another test, I renamed a real field  (a column in the table). here again, the BOModel remains with the old name; but when I run the view, I see the new column name even if it is not included in the model's view (like if the field is found and added because the model does not contains a reference to hide it)
What should I make to ensure that the properties name are correctly updated to reflect the current data model  ?
Thanks

I have the form with many items located in the layout controls.

Hi guys,
We started to work with ASP.NET MVC technology and we decided to use your controls unfortunately we are facing some issues.
Maybe we are just missing something but we have problems with unobtrusive validation in DateEdit (maybe same problem will be in ComboBox I did not tested it).  I attached sample where you can test our scenario.
Problem is that when there exists intialized DateTinme property it's value is se to input value of DateEdit control but when we click on button clear OR manually delete text in Input input value is still assigned and thus Unobtrusive validation is not validating properly and whoel valdiating is on server side - this is undesired behavior for us. 
Use case:
- Run app
- Default/Index detail is showed - with predefined SatrtDate property and jquery/jquery-validate/jquery-validate-unobtrusive js files included - using CDN
-  try to use Clear button OR manually delete value in input and click Save button
- when Unobtrusive valdiation works only message above  form should tell us "Start date must be assigned!!!" otherwise server side validation redirect us to Default/Error page which is wrong for us.
Can you please help us? How to achieve that your controls will work correctly with unobtrusive validation - I tried your  samples 
 but we don't want to use your FormLayout for now because we are using combination of default @Html.Editor controls along with yours. We need to solve this problem ASAP.
Thanks for  help.

Hi guys,
this is mostly a follow-up to 
, where I had a similar question regarding the Dashboards module.
This time, I'm inquiring regarding the ReportsV2 module. Let me just copy & paste my previous inquiry from the above mentioned ticket:
"I'm currently creating a XAF-Web application with XPO dataobjects for a client. I got the datamodel ready and my client is already using the platform to input his data. Now, of course some kind of Reports are required using your ReportsV2 module. I have various questions/requests. Let me start with the basic behind the current platform:
1. The project uses the SecurityModule with SecuritySystemUser/Roles to deny object access to certain types/objects depending on the user role
2. The meat of the data is stored in unsecured types (
, 
, 
, etc. - more on that later), that are aggregated objects on a secured parent-type called 
.
*) As defined above in 2., my data classes are unsecured types, so I currently have to check in the Filter part of the dashboard datasource if the Parent property is not null, because if the ParentEntry is null, this means it has been filtered by the security module and thus the user does not have access to this specific data. So I need a way to set this filter automatically, programatically and DO NOT let the user change this filter. Otherwise they would be able to see data they're not supposed to. Is there a way to do this?" 
So I'm looking for a similar solution to the one provided in the referenced ticket.  A bit of my own research into your classes reveals that I might need to implement my own 
, override the 
, maybe even override the 
module. But I'd like to hear your suggestion before I start anything.
Kind regards,
- Christoph 

I need some TextEdit controls to not allow the space character when editing.
Setting the masktype to RegEx and using this expression :
  ^[^\\s ]+$
seems to do it, but the ^and  the $ character are always displayed when editing. I dont want that
And even worse, it also stores these 2 characters in the database.
I also tried this 
    [^\\s ]*
and now the ^and $ are not displayed anymore, but now it makes all characters s capital
for example an existing value 
  +37063132603@sms-gtt.com; +4915788692687
is transformed to
  +37063132603@SmS-gtt.com;+4915788692687
The space is gone with no special characters at the start and end, but all s are changed to S
How can I setup a TextEdit so it will accept anything except the space character ?

What I expected: The dots fill the gap between the text and the "1800" stop.

Hi,
I have a aspxgridlookup and I want to grab filtered  text on header or get like incremental filtering on server side.
Like: 
 
Why i want this;
 I have a product list, all items singular in gridlookup. Some products has more than one barcode.
I want to do manual server-side filtering for the barcode when the user writes any text.
To do this I placed a button next to the grill. In debug mode, I can see the server-side Grid's 'clienttext' property in text, but I can not use it in code. 
How can i do this? 
Thanks

Greetings,
I would like to make a questions based on an issue that i am facing.
My scenario is as follows:
I have a XtraReport and i would like to know if i can embed a PDF file to it. 
In other words, show one or more PDF files that has been uploaded to the system .
I know for a fact that i can show text that was saved in the database through the HTML Editor using a RichText , and i also know that i can show pictures on the report as well. But can i show a PDF file?
If not, can i at least show the report and then once the report ends show the PDF as well?
If my scenario is unclear, i will try to provide as much more information that i can.
I greatly appreciate any kind of help and guidance.
Thanks in advance

Hello,
This ticket is related to the previous one:
Unfortunately not only horizontal scrolling works slow in IE.
We receive complaints from our customers that some features of datagrid works slower in IE than in Chrome.
Here is codepen example: 
Following things works slowly:
Column resizing: especially for columns located on the left side ('Employee', 'Order Date')
Column box grag/drop while trying to group data
Column reordering: column box drag/grop as well as column order change itself
I am using IE 11.850.15063.0.
Is there any way to increase performance?

I would like to make my app coherent with all the others Android and iOS app when the back button is pressed and the selected view is root.
I did succeed to remove the exit behaviour from the app but now when the back button is pressed nothing happen . I would like that when it is pressed the app is placed in the background 

I want to put a button in a dxLayoutgroup (taken from the HybridApp demo).
The buttons height is 35Pixel, the dxLayoutcontrol that is placed on a cxGroupbox is 60 pixels.
Even with that height, the dxLayoutcontrol shows scrollbars.
In the designer it can be seen that the dxLayoutItem is not much bigger then the button.
The dxLayoutgroup is much higher, it needs some space for the caption.
However, turning off the caption does not free the unused space.
Deleting the text does not help too.
In my case I would need to make the Layoutgroup much bigger than the buttons height to eliminate the scrollbars.
The screenshot shows the visible caption, setting visible to false removes just the text, but does not change the height and positions.
Changing the height manually is not possible.
Is it really a design decision that a Layoutgroup claims that much space ?
Regards
Gerhard Sachs

Hi there,
I am using line chart.

Could you please let me know how can I start my line series from y-axis. 

Hi,
if you open 
 and do a right-click on the column-header of the grid, the icon of the sort asc/desc are misaligned (see screenshot).
 Interestingly I just saw this behaviour in this particular demo ...
Happens in Chrome/Edge/... 

I'm switch from the TabControl to the DocumentManager. currently when the users right click on a tab header we show a couple of menu options.
see attached.
I want to add a 'Close All' and a  'Close report of <Type>' options.

I have a data model of entities that represent components and assemblies of components. In this scenario, some attributes of an assembled component depend only on the components that make up the assembly, so database normalization tells me to not duplicate those values.
Example:
 - Connector Type A has diameter 100
 - Connector Type C has diameter 120
 - Component 1 has a front and a rear connector, in this example Type A (front) and Type C (rear)
 - Consequently, Component 1 has a front diameter of 100 and a rear diameter of 120
I've used the Scaffolding Wizard and am trying to adapt the generated views and view models to accomodate my requirements. This is no problem for the collection view models, as I can just add the additional columns in the XAML (ComponentCollectionView.xaml):
However, this only works partially in the single object view model, where I create and edit components. I've added additional DataLayoutItems to show the nested attributes FrontConnection.Diameter and RearConnection.Diameter, but they are only updated once when the view is opened. So far, I've found no way to update the view when a different connector is selected. Here is the relevant part of ComponentView.xaml I've changed:
Part of the problem seems to be that the LookUpEdits for front and rear connector are bound to FrontConnectorID and RearConnectorID of the underlying entity, which means that the navigation properties FrontConnector and RearConnector themselves are NOT updated when another connector is selected.
I've tried a few things, but none of them worked and it would be too long to list them all here. I hope that you can instead point me to an elegant solution ;)
(Among them was overriding NeedSave() and calling Entity.OnPropertyChanged(...), but that doesn't work for the properties of nested entities.)
What I want to avoid is implementing a INotifyPropertyChanged on all my entities because they are so many and I can't use Fody to do that for me.
If no better solution is possible, I'd settle with a way to be notified of selection change in the LookUpEdits and manually refreshing the DataLayoutItems in question. Also, please note that I have this scenario for multiple entities, so a change in the base view model (SingleObjectViewModel) would be better than having to implement proxy properties in quite a few view models.
I've attached a sample project to demonstrate my problem.
Thank you!

Hello,
in our application we have we have a TreeList with a structure like this:
IsComment (bool) | Color (Color) | Column 1 (text) | Column 2 (text) | Column3 (string) | ...
For all columns that are marked as comments, all text columns should merge to one. I found the following sample:
 The sample actually merges the columns, but the containing editor and text display stays within the bounds of the corresponding column. What we need when merging is that the editor of "Column 1" spans over the other text columns. It should get all available space that is left from the first two columns, which need to stay in any case.
 Thanks for your help!

Thanks for your advice
it worked on ComboBox
but in grid view SetEditFormTemplateContent
c.DataItem is a WebDataRow
how to convert it to its original object 

We use an extra non-visible column to use its ImageComboBoxProperties and add items dynamically, after asigning it to the AProperties of the GetPropertiesForEdit event. Since updating to v17.1.10 this causes an Access Violation. I added a test project to illustrate.

Hello DeveXpress support team,
At the Middle-Tier Application using wcf, We created 10 users who assigned different role  for Security function testing
and The role has the Navigation permission only  in order to show Navigation menu.
During the test, 
I met a strange situation often that there is a message that 'Access deny'  because Exception occurs while assigning the 'DetailView' view to WinWindow.
and than I have a persistent ClassA have CreateUser and ModifyUser fields. 
For concurrency test, A large number of users have logged into the system and send a transactions to  create a object. I expected that the same values are stored in both fields but CreateUser and ModifyUser had different users.
My Question
1. Is the login user information likely to be shared on the Security system?
2. Can the logged in user right affect other users?
3.  How can we avoid this strange situation?
 Blow code is my client/server side code for the connection.
I shoud be use Direct SQL and Custom Log paramater.
Is there anything wrong with this?

Hello 
I've been trying to develp a planner solution using tcxScheduler and i've come across some issues, 
1
if i use a "large" timestep like 30/60 minute its possible that my events will overlap eachother, 
ie. event1 - 10:00 -> 12h13 
     event2 - 12h25->13h00
if i use timestep 30' this will occur, 
can the event be displayed in it's correct position, the only way i eas able to reproduce the intended behaviour was to define 1min as time step and then hide lines, this is not satisfactory because of the space consumed and makes horizontal scroll a pain..



thanks for your time

Hi,
How can I highlight the resource row in the Scheduler when a user clicks the resource in that row? 
See attachment: Let's say the user clicks at the position of the blue arrow, how can I highlight the whole row? It's allright when the styling of the highlight is the same as when the user clicks a single cell in the row (see yellow circle in the attachment)
Best regards!

Dear,
I've a simple  ASPxComboBox with AutoPostBack=true and OnValueChanged server side.
When normally change value of ComboBox  it's works well.
Now, I must do something on client side, for example with SetSelectedIndex.
When I must SetSelectedIndex I see combo changed but not fire OnValueChanged server side.
I've try use call PerformCallback on client side, in this case OnValueChanged server side fired but SelectedItem on server side is null.
I've try use AutoPostBack=false with SelectedIndexChanged="function(s, e) { e.processOnServer=true; }" /> but i've same effect.  
Why ?!?

Hi,
i am porting a WinForms desktop aplication to a more touch enabled UI and am using the Skin from your DemoCenters HypridApp.
My problem is the onscreen keyboard. 
The keyboard does not pop out when a textbox is entered; this is ugly, but acceptable.
More important: When the keyboard is visible, the screen does not scroll up and the keyboard hides the textbox, the only place i'd needed this, is in your DataLayoutControl. 
Do newer versions of this control have an automatism to handle keyboard and window behaviour?
If not, what is your advice to do this?
Regards
 

The clicked cells don't return the right selected time.
it seems that it refers to the previous cell.

I've got a listview with the MasterDetailMode set to ListViewDetailView.
I also have an action button on the detailview part of the screen. After hitting that button, i want to move the records in the listview to the last record.
I had the button ctroller linked to the Listview and everything was fine. I moved the button to the Detailview and now the listview does not move to the last record.Previously I searched for the last record and set the view.currentobject to the last record.  The button sits on the detailview part of the screen now. I want to access the lstview part and move the grid to the last record.
Can you please help me with some vb code. I've tried

Hi guys,
I was wondering about a way to use both dxDatagrid and  DevExtreme.AspNet.Data  with Entity Framework' navigation properties.
I'm using the dxDataGrid with DevExpress.data.AspNet.createStore as Store.
I've modified the DevExtreme.AspNet.Data  to work with asp.net WebForms (just the DataSourceLoadOptions class, the logic of the query engine
has not been modified).
Everything works perfect (pagination,filtering,sorting...) but I cant query the dataBase over foreign keys.
I've got a table with some columns that are foreign keys to other tables (thus Entity framework creates the proxy for this external key) .
For example:
Table Cant:
Cant_Id -> Integer (Primary Key)
Codice -> Varchar
...
...
Fil_Id -> Integer (Foreign Key)
The column Fil_Id is a reference to the table Fil
I want that the dxDatagrid' Fil_Id column displays not the Fil_Id foreign Key value but some others related entity property values.
How should i customize the store for that? does the DevExtreme.AspNet.Data allow this kind of behaviour? 
I know that Entity Framework uses the expression " DbQuery<TResult>.Include(Entity.property)  " to load the related entity through the proxy
Just tell me if you need some others infos.
Thanks 
 

I am trying to have a "popup window" that allows the user to upload a file for processing in a XAF web app. I am having trouble adding a FileData property to a non-persistent class, which I then use in the popup window. Specifically I get the following error after I try to browse to the file (which is demonstrated by the image "error.png" in the attached zip file.
When I look at the XAF log file (also included in attached zip file), I see the following error:
Steps to reproduce are:
- Run  Web app
- Click on "File Test"
- From file edit, browse to any file
- Error will show as soon as file browser dissappears 
I am relatively new to XAF, but could you please help me resolve this issue
Thanks,
Jarrad 

I appear to be having the same problem as this case 
I have attached a modified project and image showing my issue. For the sake of example I am attempting to format the "Quantity" field to display a duration in hours, minutes and seconds.
If you run the application, you can see that the Amount field formats correctly in both the filter and on the grid. However the Quantity field shows correctly on the grid but incorrectly as an integer value on the filter. Is there a setting that I am missing?
Thanks,
Russell.

Hello ,
          currently i have one window and after click on next button my data will be change.
so on that time i want to apply slide and fade effect on my window.
for show there is changes in window.
can you please help me how to achieve this with your control.
for more detail please see the attached video.
if you provide me any sample then it will be helpful for me 

Steps to reproduce:
- Create a PivotDashboardItem;
- Add a measure to Values and set its format as: Currency, Unit = Ones, Precision = 2, Include group separator = True;
- Add a random dimension to Rows;
- Add a Icon Range format rule (any)  to the measure added in Values;
- Change the values' measure caption to something short (the caption needs to be shorter  than the width of the largest value)
- Export (Print Preview) the Pivot  - some values will be truncated;
See animated gif of these steps.

Hi,
My query is regarding ASPxGridView insert/update. I need to open row data as "EditFormAndDisplayRow " mode but not need to save per row basis instead of I need to save it using another button click which not consist in grid.
During search about this problem I find one solution "T202419" which partially support my criteria but it is 4 years old and not have any demo application.

I have an MVCxGridView that I use to show events on my site, with each row representing an event.  I would like to create a column that contains a button that could be used to open up an MVCxPopupControl that in turn will contain a form with settings for the event.
This is what I have so far:
 
Here the idea is that I have assigned an ID to the button in each row with the following format: "DashboardEventUPDDashboardEventGrid_PermissionButtonColumnHyperLink_<ID>" where <ID> is the ID of the object.
This approach is beginning to work but there are some outstanding issues.  For instance, how can I make it so that whenever a new window of the PopupControl is invoked, all of the others are closed?
Are there any better ways of approaching this problem overall? 

ASPXGridView - Links not displaying on first row of Gridview.  An error also displays when I selected the invisible link. Let me know if you need any additional items. 

Hello Anatol
Thanks for the work around. Unfortunately this does indeed solve the problem with the action buttons, but creates a worse problem: The actions, firlters and so on are not displayed at all when switching to that tab (if a filter is present)...until....I check an item. I will have to leave it as is until this problem is fixed, since the alternative is a lot more confusing for the user.

Hi
I have a ASP.MVC Web Dashboard, with grid view.
I'm creating a dashboard XML file with the MVCDashboard in Designer mode.
Could you please assist me in finding instructions for following filtering..
I have drawings which are revisioned.
A drawing can have any number of dates (date is a master filter by the way) or none.
drawing 1, date a
drawing 1, date b
drawing 2, date b
drawing 2, date c
drawing 3, date d
where dates a < b < c < d
I'm trying to "group" my grid items to show "latest date per item", like:
drawing 1, date b
drawing 2, date c
drawing 3, date d
I tried adding Day(max) as hidden field, and do TOP-N-1 by Max Day, but then the result is
drawing 3, date d 
 -> All drawings disappear that don't have revision for date d, and that's not what I want.
Is this doable with the Dashboard engine or do I need to do it in SQL side?
Here's a pic illustrating the data:

Hi,
I wrote this code inside the ColumnFilterChanged of the GridView control to get the filter applied from the user, so I can apply the same filter to the Chart control inside the same form.
The grid is bounded to the data source.
The user can create own filter but if he writes:
   - the value exactly as it is in the database, the filter works in both controls (grid and chart)
   - the value all in lower case or all in upper case, the filter works only into the grid
My question is if there is a way to indicate to the chart filter to ignore the case of the string.
Thanks

Hello, 
We have found an issue where window borders disappear under certain conditions. This first appeared with some of our Tool windows and dialogs so it may just be related to that setting. I am using per monitor DPI scaling of %125 to test this. To reproduce this issue, set DPI to %125 and open the attached sample application on the scaled monitor. Note that the bottom window border is missing. It can be hard to see but it helps to move the window over a white background. 

Is there a way for the CameraControl to recognize webcams on the client computer when running on a server through a remote desktop connection?
For example - I have two webcams attached to my computer. If I then  start a remote desktop connection to a different computer, and run an application on that computer that uses the CameraControl, it does not recognize the two webcams that I have on the client.
Are there any other  limitations to the devices that this control supports?

Hi guys,
We are facing a  problem in XAF Web.
When user uses IE 9 or 10 there is strange behavior when user try to change filter above GridView. I attached a simple sample.
Use case:
- turn on compatibility view settings for domain you testing on - IE 11 -> Settings -> Compatibility View Settings -> Add localhost:port
- run app
- DomainObject1_ListVIew should be initial view
- Press F10 Developer tools in IE and change compatibility to IE 10 or 9
- Open some other app (chrome, word, Visual studio whatever application) in front of IE
- do not minimalize this whatsoever application just in taskbar choose IE again (whatsoever app should stay open not minimized behind IE window)
- then try to change filter above DomainObject1_ListView - after click on some filter IE is throwed to background and whatsoever app is pushed to front
 This behavior is pretty annoying and most of our cusomers uses IE 10 which cause problems a lot. From what I read on the internet some css could cause this behavior in IE9/10 (can not remember which one).
Could you please somehow fix this? IE 11 and other browsers are ok this roblem occurs only in IE9/10.
Thanks a lot

Greetings. 
I am looking for a way to help me achieve a way to rearrange rows, almost like how the drag and drop feature does but a little differently. also making the move as intuitive as possible for a user. 
I have a treelist with a structured treelike datasource. 
what I hope to achieve is a way to move rows using the keyboard. I.E => 
focus a row. Hit Ctrl + arrow up and down, showing previews of new position of the row.
The trick would be to:
Hide the focused row and display a preview of a new row position (such as underneath the 'new focused row, as the focused cell would move with arrowstrokes) without triggering various updateevents in the form before the new location is chosen and the Ctrl button is released. 
I was concidering using simply the OptionsView.ShowPreview feature to achieve this. But im sure there is a better way to do this, that I havent thought of, hence I ask for advice. 
Let me know if anything isnt clear.

Hi,
I have a chart which has a datasource specified by an array.
On a button click (without a server trip) I'd like to apply a filter to the chart based on a column on the datasource.  Is this possible?
If it's not possible with an array, then could you please explain how it would be best implemented given that I'm using ASP.NET Core MVC as my backend?
Thanks

Hello,
I'm having to work out several problems relative to using the Chrome browser instead of Internet Explorer.
This particular problem has to do with when a ASPxPopupControl is shown  and the content page has a Callback panel.
And inside that panel is a table that surrounds other  controls, etc. and is also used get focus onload.
The focus works in IE and Firefox but not in Chrome and Edge.
I've attached a test project that displays the problem.
Thanks, Jack
 

Hi,  
Good morning, I have a query within the subscription that I acquired, I have the possibility of using the Dashboard tool, because although according to the order and what you have told me, I have DevExtreme but when I want to use the controls for the Creation of an App tells me that I have the subscription expired.  
I would like to know please the scope of the subscription that I have.  
Thank you in advance for your support. 

I tried using your solution but it does not work correctly. 
This does not work when I have multiple row field. the index show up incorrectly when you have multiple row fields. also teh index changes when its in expanded state vs collapsed state. 
 

In the version almost all the problem has been solved, except for the following case:
see attached image.
When we select the option "all" and null acontinuation, they are not filtered correctly.

Hello,
It seems that in the case of the MVCxDashboard, when a dashboard parameter is bound to a calculated field the lookup values are not initialized properly. When I check the ExtractDataFlowStorage, I see that it doesn't contain any column.
Please refer to the archive attached and its content to recreate the dashboard and reproduce the issue. The database used is AdventureWorks2012.
It is possible to use a calculated field as the display member only IF the calculated field contains only one column and that this column is the column used as the value member. The provided example demonstrates that as well. 
Thank you very much for fixing this. 
Have a good day,
Best regards

Workaround: Don't use Structures, they are handy but not strictly necessary, just copy and paste the columns on domain components that needs it, if you only need one reference to the structure per DC you could create a non-persistent base DC to inherit from. It may become a little messy if you had a bunch of them but I'll work.

Hello
I would like to know if there is a way to get a ASPxGridView column's width  on  the client side?
Any help would be appreciated.

Hi,
I am using the DxDataGrid component in an Angular app, to display some information, most of which is calculated "on-the-fly". This means that most cells in the DxDataGrid do not have fixed values - they have a dxTemplate set, which is calling a function in the components' source file. The component whose markup contains the DxDataGrid has its' change detection strategy set to 
.
The markup looks something like this:
The 
method simply returns a string:
Now, whenever 
 - namely the click event on the heading - all values in the cells in the DxDataGrid are being recalculated and the 
function is being called. Since the event fired (clicking the heading) does in NO way affect the data displayed in the DxDataGrid, I see no reason for the values to be recalculated.
Is this the intended behaviour of the component? If it is, is there a way to prevent the values from being recalculated? Since I'm trying to display quite a lot of data, I would like the cells to be redrawn/recalculated only when the data bound to the DxDataGrid actually changes.

Hi there,
I?m having a little trouble with customizing the scheduler?s context menu. I?m clearing all default items and add custom item?s. But the menu is too narrow, and explicitly setting it?s width creates an odd result (see attached image). How can I get the menu to have the exact width to display it?s items texts? Btw. is it possible to remove the space reserved for item icons?
Thank you, Raphael

A DomainComponent with a property of a type that is non-persistent class fails with an exception is that property is part used in a RuleCombinationOfPropertiesIsUnique when trying to save the DomainComponent.
To reproduce: Open "Use Non Persistent" list view click "New", on the detail view look for the "Values" nested list, create a new "UseNewPersistent_SpecialValue" object, on the (yet another) detail view click "Save".
Workaround: In my case I could use for the rule the hidden persistent property that is used to calculate the non-persistent one, but in that case I get the validation error popup, but not the validation indicator on the property.


Following the 
 shows an empty list. For some reason the ObjectSpace on the controller is an XPObjectSpace instead of a NonPersistentObjectSpace. I did not leave the example but the same occurs when trying to show a 
.
To reproduce: Open "My Value" list view From navigation
Workaround: Create a Non-Persistent class that contains the list, show the detail view of such class from the navigation. When initializing the object for the detailview create it manually (
)


I'm trying to show a summary of items similar to this 
. But instead of calculating the results on memory, I'm trying to do it on the database using 
 And instead of a string property, I'm trying to group by a calculated enum property. It fails with an exception.
To reproduce: Open "Am Queried" list view, create some objects, on the list view click "Show Summary By Calulated Type"
Workaround: Create another non browsable calculated string property and group by it, so you still get to use the enum one (possibly with images). Or if there aren't lots of items you could materialize (with 
 or 
) the list before grouping and group on the client instead of on the server.

Hello support, I have an action that uses Frame.SetView to set the last visited listview as current view, I've attached a small sample project with it. I'd like it to check for modification before changing, so that the user can save without losing anything.
How should i do that?
Thanks
Giuseppe 

Dear Support
I have been trying to copy a sample on your site whereby in a TreeView, when you click on a Node (Focused Node) then the Select icon changes. I have been able to get it to change by, using the attached sample, clicking on a child node then off clicking the text box so that the treeview looses control focus. It however does not work from Node to Node as the sample shows.
I have tried the InvalidateNode in the FocusedRowChanged, and this worked to a degree, in respect that as you click each node it changed the icon as you click through the nodes, however once you have clicked the node once, if you came back to it, it would not change twice.
I have attached a sample

Hi,
I am trying to use ExtraGrid in a  WCF project. I have taken grid object and directly trying to export it without showing on form. In this case Multi line functionality is not working while if grid is shown on a form and then exported, it is working fine.
Please suggest. Sample code is attached. ( To check result please call function ExportGrid.ExportGriddata(true) with both true and false parameters in programme.cs)
Thanks. 

Yes, that solved it, thanks.
Extra question:) 
Why is the dashboard thinking this is ? Check attached picture 

Hi, I'm moving my first steps with the scheduler control, I think it is amazing!
In one of my forms I have to prevent users from creating/editing/deleting appointments, so I used the AllowAppointmentCreate, AllowAppointmentDelete and AllowAppointmentEdit properties.
Everything is ok but I don't like the tooltip form because it continues to show the Edit and the Delete buttons. They are disabled, by the way, but I prefer not to show them.
I like the style of the default tooltip, it is possible only to remove the Edit and the Delete buttons? Alternatively, it is available a template that I can modify without starting from an empty ascx file?
Thanks in advance for your reply.

Hello,
I was reading about the EditForm here:
My question is about the possibility of saving/restoring the Grid's EditForm layout. For example, if we know the type of an object list shown in the grid, have different EditForms layouts stored somewhere and apply the corresponding that we want to use for the type of the objects and fields shown in the grid. Basically is to have a custom way of loading the EditForms layouts.
Could you help me?
Thanks in advance!!!

I am trying to construct a WinForms application that has a ribbon and application menu that are always present with default buttons and menu items, but I add content to the ribbon based on the type of file that is opened.  I would like to support DevExpress RichEditControl and SpreadsheetControl ribbons, as well as my own custom ribbons.
As an example, I may have a Home category that is always present in the ribbon, but when a .DOCX file is opened, I dynamically add a RichEditControl with the full auto-generated ribbon from DevExpress (and perhaps minor customizations to the ribbon).  If I close the .DOCX file and open an .XLSX file, then I remove the RichEditControl and the associated ribbon content and then dynamically add a SpreadsheetControl with all of the auto-generated ribbon content to the main ribbon.  I may also open an image that has a different ribbon.  I do not wish to support multiple files being opened at the same time, or document panel floating, or MDI tabs. 
What is the best strategy to achieve this?  Thanks much.


Another question on ASPxTreeList: for using the CustomDataCallback function and the ASPxClientTreeListCustomDataCallbackEventArgs, I need the NameSpace DevExpress.Web.ASPxTreeList.Scripts.

How to solve this small problem?
Thanks in advance!

I was wondering if I can enter items into an ASPxGridLookup control that are not contained in the underlying datasource and prevent the control from clearing them.
In my application, I'm trying to provide the user a multi-select multi-column dropdown list of email addresses.  I would like to allow the user to search and choose multiple items from the list, but ALSO enter an email address "freehand".
Let's say I have the following data in my aspxgridlookup:
Email/Company/Type
 aaa@test.com, aaa corporation, customer email
bbb@test.com, bbb corporation, vendor email
 ccc@test.com, ccc corporation, employee email 
My control now properly says:
aaa@test.com; ccc@test.com
If the user were to add:
;ddd@test.com
at the end of the string which is not in the list, the "ddd" entry is rejected and cleared because it is not in the lookup.  I would like to allow the user to multi select AND add entries not in the list.
The aspxCombo Box in DropDown style is close, but does not allow multiselect like the aspxGridLookup does.

Hi,
We have ASPxGridViews and ASPxCardViews that display email addresses (among other things), what is the best way to make those "clickable"?  Ie to display "someone@something.com" as a hyperlink which leads to "mailto:someone@something.com"

I'm trying to develop a new skin for our company. I'm getting there, but there are a couple items which I haven't figured out how to edit.
One of these is the BarHeader item for the Bars product. It uses the ColorScheme (or skin mask) color, and lightly colors the background of the BarHeader. I was able to find several help threads on how to custom draw this at runtime, but we don't want 100+ programmers to have to do this for every header Item. Rather, I want to be able to tell it in the Skin Editor (V2)  "Don't apply color".
I just can't seem to find what option in the editor controls this element. 

I want to "print" something in the CustomDrawNotesCell event of the TcxSchedulerReportLink object.
I want to define the position in mm. To do this I need to know the resolution of the canvas.
I saw that AItem.Width is16950, on print it's 90 mm. 
The question is where comes the 16950 from?
If I don't made any mistake this is approx. 4775 dpi (That's neither the dpi of my screen nore of my printer) .
Any hint is welcome.
Thanks in advance.
With kind regards,

In my application right now, I have controls which validates on Enter, but the cursor remains in the field.
When you hit the tab key, the control is also validated, and the cursor leaves the control focus when validation is ok.
Users of the application would like the ENTER and TAB keys to have the same behaviour however; how can I map the ENTER key behaviour to that of the TAB key.

Hello,
When a MVCxDashboard is loaded , a DataLoadingWeb event is raised for each data source to fill the dashboard's data cache and one is raised for each dynamic list used by the dashboard parameters.
However, when the dashboard's data cache has expired and that an interaction  is executed, a DataLoadingWeb event will be raised for each data source but none will be raised for the parameters. As a consequence, the look up values are not updated and may not match the current data to which they are bound.
Please, find attached an archive containing a dashboard layout as well as its query text. You'll also find an SQL query that updates data the "Commercial" parameter is bound to.  The database used is AdventureWorks2012.
To reproduce the issue : 
- open the dashboard
- check the lookup values available for the "Commercial " parameter
- edit the data base using the provided script
- wait for the cache to expire
- perform an interaction to trigger the DataLoadingWeb event
-  once the data are refreshed, you should see that the look up values available for the Commercial parameter have not been updated as they should have.
Thanks in advance for taking care of this, good luck.
Have a good afternoon.

Hi support,
I Need to select all rows of a group row that is child of other grouprow, i already test your example (E1760 - aspxgridview-how-to-implement-select-unselect-for-all-rows-in-a-group-row ) but this only works if grouprow do not have other group row, that means, only works if it is group by one level.

Hi everyone
We are currently examining how we could integrate your DevExtreme Product into our Web-Projects. In the process, we had some trouble with the DataGrid in combination with an OData service (created with your Wizard).
This is our basic setup:
ODataContext:
Datasources:
DataGrid:
Our Car objects have a CarType, which is an Object on its own. So we set the "expand" property on the Car datasource and use a lookup for the CarType which has its own datasource. Loading and displaying of the data works as expected.
The only problem now is, as soon as we change the CarType of a Car in the row's lookup, saving the changes fails.
Analysing the network requests tells me, that such a change tries to update the ID of the child object CarType, which results in an error message from the OData Service, stating "Deep Updates are not supported...". I expected it to update the ForeignKey "CarTypeId" on the parent object.
I assume we are using these components a wrong way or missed some configurations. Using the CarType object itself as the dataField and setting "valueExpr" to "this" didn't work either.
 Could you please give us a hint to how we can achieve the expected behaviour?
Thank you very much and best regards
David

3. click the + of the filter
4. close the popup
5. click "click me" button

I could only reproduce this behavior with the special animation we've added to the popup. 

Hello Support.
I have a grid with Angular 5  having calculated cell values not related to any dataField.
The filterBuilder setup for this grid as described in your demo not works because the dataField is missing on some colums and exceptions are thrown.

Thank you.

Hi, 
I attached a video to demonstrate this and also a sample application.
I seems that it does not happen all the time, but you can see in the video how applying Sugiyama algorithm does not correct the connector type. But if I drag a little bit the node connected by the wrong typed connector, the layout updates automatically and connector type is corrected. After this step, if I click again on "Apply Sugiyama" button, the mentioned connector does not get wrong anymore.
Please take a look.

I have a GridControl with multiple selection performed with a CheckBoxSelectorColum. When a row is selected, a separate grid filled with details is shown
I'd like to make this grid appear  even when I am just clicking on a row, not the Check box
I still need to keep the checkbox in for selection, but would like to get the current clicked on item!
I managed to find an ugly workaround using a HitTest in code behind but would like to see if there is anything else better beforehand. Can you let me know if there is one?
Thanks

Dear sir or Madam; 
I am thinking to high-light one column in wpf GridControl when there are lots of columns.  I changed the Grid row column background color with following: 




I also have a dxg:GridControl.GroupSummary
                            <dxg:GridSummaryItem FieldName="DailyPnl" SummaryType="Custom" DisplayFormat = " {0:N0}"  /> 
I hope the P&L column will be highlighted in different color, but for the group summary row, the color is not changed.  When I google, there is a way to change the background for all summary column, but I only want to change one column background.  thanks.  What is the best way to do this?   thanks

I would appreciate any help to identify the source of the problem if it is related to the XtraMap library..

Hi,
We get sometimes the following message: Cannot create a document for the current report
As i see the build request will be created, but the response is empty, we do not get any logs and any exceptions.
With VS i can reproduce it, i just compile the application, then i use it everything is fine, i can create reports, then i stop it and restart it.
The page is still open, so i reload the page, and then i get this following exception, because on the "beforeunload" event we call this "viewer.GetPreviewModel().reportPreview.deactivate();"
Exception:
ReleaseHandleFailed occurred
Message: Managed Debugging Assistant 'ReleaseHandleFailed' has detected a problem in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\IIS Express\iisexpress.exe'.
Additional information: Ein SafeHandle oder CriticalHandle vom Typ "ZLibStreamHandle" konnte das Handle mit dem Wert 0x00000000 nicht ordnungsgem?? freigeben. Dies zeigt normalerweise an, dass das Handle auf andere Weise falsch freigegeben wurde (z. B. durch Extrahieren des Handles mit DangerousGetHandle und direktes Schlie?en oder durch Erstellen eines anderen umschlie?enden SafeHandles.)
 After that we can not create reports, all of the responses of the buildrequests are empty.
If i remove the "deactivate" then everything is fine.
Do you have an idea for me?

I try to connect my repository using ado.net store procedure with GridView, but I've some error?s.
Can you help me to solve this erros? using my repository with ado.net to bind GridView for CRUD operations.
I attach my project using a simple model Funcionario and FuncionarioController for your verifications.
My Repository is in directory /Repository file FuncionarioRepository.cs using Conexao.cs to connect to database sqlserver.
So, I was able to read from the database and load in the gridview with some errors, but insert update and delete did not.
Please you could fix my project to perform all the operations of crud with the Gridview using my repository:

This has been tripping me up for a little bit. For some reason the dxTabPanel contents aren't being displayed in their respective tabs. I can see the contents in the HTML source, but they're hidden away. Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong here?

I am using the MapControl, and have settled on using Vector Layers that use ListSourceDataAdapters.  In these, I provide custom ObservableCollections of my objects to be mapped.
What I need now is a way to define these layers and their associated objects at runtime.  The DataSources are easy enough, but how can I define the Vector Layers?  I don't see any bindable properties on the MapControl for layers.
My goal here is to be able to provide multiple Vector Layers which will each contain a different category of data.  Ultimately, I intend to create a UI element that will allow the user to toggle these layers on or off.  I suppose this would resemble the way a Google map might show "restaurants" and "department stores" and "tourist attractions" all in a single map, but with these elements able to be turned off and not shown.

Hi
How can I go about always showing the first record in the VGrid regardless of the filter criteria a user has set?  I use the first record to display some readonly data that I don't want to be affected by the filtering an end user might  apply.  I tried to use the CustomRecordFilter event but that only allows me to hide a record not to show it.  Is there any way I can achieve this?
Thanks

Please see the video. The project is to involved to create an example. What is happening is I have a text box and button on a ASPXPageControl along with a ASPXGridView. I type my text into the text field then click the save button and would like to see the grid update after the save function. You can see in the video that the data is there after sorting the records by clicking the column. 
Any help would be appreciated 

Hi,
I have a master detail grid defined (angular 4) as shown below.
However, when I click the expand icon (the > arrow), it expands the wrong row.
When stepping into it via browser debugger, it looks like the "e" event passed to onMasterRowPrepared(e) is just straight up not the correct row.
Do you know of why this is happening?
 

If you include a dash character in an HTML Editor's control name, the Insert Image dialog will hang with a "Loading" spinner. The attached demo project should demonstrate the issue well enough.
This was previously working in an older release that we used, 14.2.6, so the issue originated somewhere between then and the current 17.2 release. Please note that we really do need this behavior to work correctly. In our application, we uniquely identify controls with GUIDs, which contains dash characters.
As near as I can tell from browser debugging, it invokes a startup script in a DevExpress control that when evaluated, fails to parse the control name as it sees the "-1" as a mathematical expression. In the case of the demo, the clientside JavaScript line that causes the error is:
If instead it was wrapped as a variable in the browser's window object like below, I 
it would work correctly, but I don't have access to modify the DevExpress startup script to really find out:
Steps to reproduce:
1)  Build and run the attached reproduction case.
2)  Press the Insert Image button on the HTML Editor's toolbar.
3) A "Loading" panel never disappears, and the browser debugger reports an "invalid or unexpected token" syntax error.
4) Adjust the HTMLEditorPartialView file to change the control's name from "TestHtmlEditor-1" to "TestHtmlEditor", and it should work as you'd expect. 

I found this post, and I seem to be having a similar issue, but this post never seems to have gone anywhere.
 
I have a dual MVC and Webforms environment.  I have a SQL Server table menu source, and a custom IHierarchicalEnumerable class as the menu data source.  I am using this same class for both the MVC and the Webforms masterpage/view.
The webforms version is working perfect and the menu items are disappearing into the ellipses as the window size decreases.  However, the MVC menu is not working, and the menu items never disappear even though the parent div width does shrink below the width of the menu itself. 
 As you can see from the screenshot, the rendered menu html is quite different.
Here is the Webforms code:
Here is the MVC view code:
Considering they are both using the same data, and the same class for data source binding, the issue seems most likely to be in the controls, the views, or the configuration.  As near as I can tell I have the relevant html code the same in both places.   So is there a setting I am missing?

4. How can I set All-Day appointment automatically? 

We have extended the GridView and AdvancedBandedGriv view classes. We just updated to DevExpress 17.2.4 and see a new property, AllowAutoFilterConditionChange.
How do we set this to false in our custom classes? When we attempt to do so (this.AllowAutoFilterConditionChange = false;) it tells us the property is read only.

Hi, I need to access to an a aspxCombobox on a Edit template, I use the event StartCardEditing but it doesn't work.
Also i need to get combobox event ItemTextCellPrepared
 
Thanks, Marcelo. 

Hello,
I'm using your SpinEdit control,  and I'd like to make it look like stock Windows 10 controls.
I found 
 ticket, but in the example the x doesn't look like the one in stock TextBox (see attached image).
Could you give me a step-by-step solution for this issue?
Thank you in advance

I have a page with a ComboBox and a batch edit GridView. The row content in the grid is determined by the choice made in the combo box.
If the grid has unsaved changes, and the value of the combo box is  changed, I would like to prompt the user informing them that unsaved changes will be lost and give them an opportunity to either confirm or cancel their combo box change.
I see some events  on the ASPxClientComboBox class (
), however I'm not sure if any of these are suited for what I'm a trying to do? 
Ideally, I would be able to handle an event on the client side, check some conditions, and if I need to cancel the combo box change set 
or something similar. Is such functionality possible?

I am developing a program that has to deal with heating programs.
Each heating program has a list of steps that the heating program must reach.
I would like to have a Grid Control where each row is a specific heating test with details about the test.
In this row I would like to have a cell that when clicked shows a drop down grid of the specific heating steps inside the test.
I am using datatables for my data sources.
Is this possible?
If so, can you give me an example?
 Thanks.

Hi,
I have 2 Columns in grid. Sa y old value and new Value. I would like to compare the values and highlight a row having difference in those columns. I am planning to use multiconverter and multi binding. But I am not sure how to pass the  data and achieve this.
Please help

We have a drop down inside the Angular Data Grid which uses "Periods" object as data source. If we add a row in the Grid with PeriodID 1 and then click on the "+" icon to insert a new row, the Drop down should not have text that belongs to PeriodID 1. Since the Display text and the drop down uses the same data source, If I update the data source, I see PeriodID 1 is removed from the drop down, but I see empty text for this column in the Grid. Please advise on how can I update the drop down entries with out removing the text for existing rows.
<dxi-column dataField="PeriodID" caption="Term" [allowEditing]="true">
 <dxo-lookup [dataSource]="Periods" displayExpr="text" valueExpr="value">
 </dxo-lookup>
 <dxi-validation-rule type="required"></dxi-validation-rule>
 </dxi-column>

Hello,
I am working on customization for the aspxhtmleditor. For selected tags/formats from the toolbar menu, is there a way to modify the action to set default css classes to specific items? I have a declared HtmlEditorCssFile which is applied to content, but has specific classes for most html elements.
For example: On the toolbar there are ordered and unordered lists.  I would like to apply a cssclass to <ol> and <ul> tags by default when they are added. How would I accomplish this?
Thank you. 

I am having an issue with the LookUpEdit object. It appears that the object, when set with a displayMember "String" and a ValueMember "String"....and a DataView is attached as the datasource. Mostly it works fine and as expected....however It does not appear to change from one selection to another when the ValueMember text is the same.
For example
I pull a list of UserName(DisplayMember)  and Email Address(ValueMember)
Two of the users have their email set to DepartmentsGenericEmail@me.com
 When I am on a user I cannot select any user with the same Value for its valuemember. While I can click on the entry and it will show in the list, clicking or choosing those entries will be ignored.
Is there any way to allow normal behavior when changing from one selection to another even if their Value Member's Value is the same? 
Thanks,
Jesse 

When I click on DevExpress DateNavigator Previous / Next Button it doesn't work unless I double Click then it would work..

Suppose I have a form with a SpreadsheetControl. I have also handled the CustomDrawColumnHeader (or RowHeader) events and I am drawing some custom text in the cell header (instead of A,B,C,1,2,3, etc)
When I look at the Print Preview of this spreadsheet (after turning on the Row and Column Headings), the heading still have the default values instead of the custom values. I'd like to be able to Print and PrintPreview with the custom values.
Is it possible to achieve this?
Thank you for the help!

HI.
I have a datable created at runtime like this.
 Private Function testDT() As DataTable
        Dim dataTable = New DataTable
        dataTable.Columns.Add("Id", GetType(Int32))
        dataTable.Columns.Add("ParentId", GetType(Int32))
        dataTable.Columns.Add("Name", GetType(String))
        dataTable.Rows.Add(New Object() {1, 0, "A"})
        dataTable.Rows.Add(New Object() {2, 1, "B"})
        dataTable.Rows.Add(New Object() {3, 1, "C"})
        dataTable.Rows.Add(New Object() {4, 0, "D"})
        dataTable.Rows.Add(New Object() {5, 4, "E"})
        Return dataTable
    End Function
So A & D should be root nodes, B&C children under A and E a child under D
How do I bind this table to the treelist as nodes/subnodes.
Currently binding this datatable ends up like as shown in attachment.

I have a case where when I click on the delete link on the Dev Extreme  Angular (4.x) data grid row, I need to make a database call and if that database call returns a row, I need show a "Information" pop up with a custom message and "OK" button (OK is the only button pop up should have) and clicking on this will just close the pop up (no changes to the grid in this case). 
If the database call does not return a row, then I need to show the delete confirmation pop up with a custom message and a "Yes" and "No" button. When "Yes" is clicked, I need to delete the row in the database and the grid. If "No" is clicked, do not delete data in database and do not delete the row in the grid. Just close the popup. Please advise how this can be achieved.

I have an ASPxPageControl with several TabPages. I would like to be able to have the TabText occupy two lines and be able to control where the TabText breaks such that I could have:
TabTextLine1
TabTextLine2
I have been unable to figure out how to do this. I will be changing the TabText from the client side. 

Refer to case T598468 for the history around this:
I have one issue remaining with trying to build this custom control.  I've fixed the properties, figured out how to make the buttons dynamic, animated, etc.
Long story short, I have two buttons on the right side of the masktextbox.  One to clear the text, one to show in-progress and a pulldown when the search is complete.
I have a textchange listener on the textbox that invokes timers and etc. to properly handle the workflow.  However, one of the things that is being done is the button visibility changes based on the text.
Example code in handler:
         private void SearchTextChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            TextBoxMaskBox textBox = sender as TextBoxMaskBox;
            string searchStr = textBox.MaskBoxText;
            // Since we're here turn the clear button on and off
            if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(searchStr))
            {
                _clearButton.Visible = false;
                _pulldownButton.Visible = false;
            }
            else
            {
                _clearButton.Visible = true;
            }
......
Here's the problem.  Typing a character in the text field, when originally empty, makes the clear button appear.  It does. But changing the visibility of the button *clears the text* in the maskbox!  How do I get it to stop doing that?  Because it raises another text change event for '' which clears the button if I don't intercept it and I've lost the first character.
I tried capturing the text in the inbound event, changing the button and then setting the text but it appears that the MaskBox deprecates the set ability so I can't put the text back... 

Hi guys, 
since I've updated to 17.2.4 version everytime I edit my pages with Dev, licenses.licx is added to the Property folder. I remove it manually, and it builds ok on Visual Studio. 
But it happens (re-adding  the file) everyytime!!! I just got the updated version of the licenses.licx file into there, but even so this issues happens. 
How to fix it? It's really boring

Good afternoon,
The default icons seem to have changed for the RichEdit control in this Major release.  Is there an option to change this back somewhere?  Testers have expressed confusion as this is a major change aesthetically and have to hunt down the same buttons they are use to clicking, as they have memorized these options by picture. 

Hi,
I would like to do the same thing as seen here in this thread:
 Image: 
 Essentially, I want to split certain columns into two rows, using a MVCxGridView as in the above image. I'd also like to be able to still support Batch Editing as well, if possible.
Is there something like this currently for MVCxGridViews? The above solution was to use StackPanels, but I don't see that as an option in MVC.
Thanks

Hello,
I'd like when I open a WPF form call a WebApi and during I wait the answer display a waiting animation ...
Is it possible ? What is the best practice ? Do you have a sample ?
Thanks, 

I have a page with a ComboBox and a batch edit GridView. The row content in the grid is determined by the choice made in the combo box. The grid has ShowConfirmOnLosingChanges set to true to warn the user about navigating away from unsaved changes.
If the grid has unsaved changes, and the value of the combo box is changed, I see I can provide a javascript handler for the combo box's QueryCloseUp event to 
1) Check if the grid has unsaved changes
2) Use a javascript confirm function call to warn the user that they are about to lose unsaved changes.
If the user doesnt want to lose the unsaved changes, this event can cancel the combo box change. But if the user does want to lose the unsaved changes then they will also be shown the ShowConfirmOnLosingChanges when the callback on the grid is performed. Is there a way that I can stop the ShowConfirmOnLosingChanges message for this specific scenario? And have ShowConfirmOnLosingChanges work normally otherwise?

I am using an EntityInstantFeedbackSource with my GridControl.  I have my main application window setup to be a container for a view.  This view can switch at the user's request, and instances of the underlying ViewModels are kept in a collection.
The current view is shown in the main window using this container:
The problem I have is that when a view with a grid is loaded, and then another view is switched to, the  EntityInstantFeedbackSource is firing the  DismissQueryable event.  Then, of course, when the view is brought to current,  GetQueryable is called again.  This has the effect of "resetting" the grid.  Filters and such all go away and everything is reloaded.
I need to maintain the exact state of the grid through these transitions.  Is there a way to prevent the DismissQueryable?

Hello DevExpress!
I use the bootstrap webapplication template from build 17.2.5 to create a new website with authentication model Identity.. The site created from the template works as expected. But if I update to the latest  Bootstrap/jQuery 4.00/3.3.1 from NuGet then the menu works fine until the browser window is so small  that the menu is collapsed to a button. When pressing the button nothing happens. Other buttons are not working either.
Try my test site 
 Buttons are not working. Reduce the browser window until the menu is collapsed and then press the menu button...
Any suggestions?

Hello,
I am trying to use the FileManager to allow the selection of images form an Amazon AWS source. I am able to do so, but the thumbnails are not showing the images, and are instead a generic empty thumbnail. 
I know that the ability to show image thumbnails without a declared thumbnail folder works via the  ImageDialog in the aspxhtmleditor automatically, which we are also using with the same amazon source. 
Is there a specific setting that I need to enable to get this functionality?
FileManager code below:

Hi. DevExpress SupportTeam.
When I created a TextEdit style that does not specify a key, I can no longer edit the cells of the grid control.
The reason is that it does not inherit the default TextEdit I created. I would like to check how much the TextEdit style that does not specify a key affects each editor or grid control.
 
I have summarized the questions in the attached PDF so please take a look.
We also attach a solution that can confirm the operation.
 
Thank you.

Hi,
Our PivotGrid control uses   Async Mode (AssociatedObject.SetDataSourceAsync(AsyncDataSource, OnDataChangedCompleted);) .  Data source is a DataTable.
we set datasoure and fields are created using attached behavior.  We have bound and unbound fields.
A jing screencast of the application is attached.
 When the report is loaded, the control displays unbound fields as "error"
once we invoke the expression editor on any unbound field (in this example all three test fields are unbound)
all unbound fields are re-evaluated and display corrects itself.
In debugging we see an exception  that is probably the cause of it.  Relevant call stack and exception details are attached as well.
Could you help us  

Hi,
The systems are a bit more diverse than specified in selection, as we are having issues in development and live, and we tested on VS2015 and 2017
Our product has 15.2 Winforms package installed. We recently upgrade from 15.1 to 15.2 (we are trying to avoid large updates to a stable product where necessary, hence we haven't moved to more recent versions, though 15.2.17 is a fairly recent release) .
15.1 did not have this issue.
When we open the Report Designer on our customer's installed application, our product crashes with the following stack trace.:
When we try this in the IDE we get a freeze.
I am aware of 
  that I found referenced in other posts (such as 
) but this is an old update now and refuses to install when I tried.
If needs be I can update to 16.2 (our latest available version), though this will be a pain in the rear as we have 5-6 integrated projects over 3 build servers that will all need to be updated, so I would prefer to avoid that.
I am also lobbying my boss to purchase a new licence ASAP to get newer versions if that is also a fix, though I can't see him being too impressed at being railroaded into that decision by a bug.
Many thanks in advance. 

Hello All,
How can I set a JSON string value (converted from DataTable)  into a chart datadource
This is my code (behind) but it does not work. Chart does not show anything.
Dim JSONString As String = String.Empty
JSONString = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(dstData) 'Comment dstData is my DataTable
BootstrapPieChart1.DataSource = JSONString 'Comment: JSONString retrieves the data in JSON format fine.
BootstrapPieChart1.DataBind()
I have tried without the DataBind method but the result is the same. 
Also, I tried to set the DataSourceURL but the result is the same, nothing...
 

Hi I have files in the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform and I am trying to load one into the aspxspreadsheet control for example
here is the format of the azure url storage (bloburi)

 and when I execute this code
the url does work and you can paste it into a browser and it downloads. 

I need to be able to select all the cells in a column, which is selected through a contextual menu.
I know how to select the cells, but I can not find an example of how to determine on which column I am opening the menu.

I have a grid that is has some row cell values in some columns that are duplicated.  I would like them to only show for some rows.
I put together the following code but I am getting an error on e.RowHandle.  The error is 
"RowHandle is not a member of 'CustomColumnDisplayTextEventArgs'
What I would like to be able to do is when the cell value of colTransaction on a particular row, is not equal to "Invoice", do not show the value in the cell of the same row in column colInvoiceDate.  Or alternately, only show the invoice date when the transaction is "Invoice".
Can you give me an idea of what is wrong?  TIA
  

The chart has multiple point in a Single date. The plotted points show  of the same day show different tool tip values.
Please find the attached video 

The chart marker point are blurred when the chart horizontal axis (X-axis) is zoomed to a maximum limit.
This happens when the difference  in the range of x-axis values is larger.
Please see the attached image.
 

Hi.
I'm having some problems with extensions in my MVC4 app. The issues is described in the attached document.
Regards, Paul Moore.

Quick question  - 
I made a small Winforms application and in it I have the F1 - F12 keys set up via the DevExpress MVVM framework as hot keys for quickly inserting text into a memoedit control. 
Everything works great except for the following:
- The F2 key seems to have a default behavior in the memoedit where it selects all of the control's displayed text when pressed. I have checked your demos and the text edit, memo edit and memo ex edit all do this in the demos as well. I cannot find anything that says if this is a default feature of windows and/or winforms' base controls (I.E. Text Edit, Rich Text Box, etc). Do you know if there is a way to turn this feature off? 
Edit: I noticed there are a couple of other tickets where people suggested using the keydown event to suppress the F2 Key. However, I am afraid this will interfere with my MVVM binding to the F2 key and the memo edit. I'm not at my development machine right now to try this out, but if you see this before I get a chance to try it tomorrow night, please let me know if you think this will cause any issues with the MVVM bindings/commands. 
- When I press the F10 key, the program sets the focus on my bar/bar manager.  From what I have been able to find out, this is functionality thats baked into Windows. Again, I couldn't find any properties or settings on the bar/bar manager to disable this functionality. However,  I have found a way to override this behavior using Win32 API calls, but out of curiosity, is there anything that DevExpress provides that makes this easier?  I noticed there was a similar ticket for this regarding the ribbon, but I can't find anything regarding the bar/bar manager:

So how can I acces them?

In old version(16.2) than this we were using jquery to maintain checkbox states(including check all in header.) 
Which was working fine. Code we are using is:
For every checkbox - 
 if (State == "U") { //To unchecked checkbox
                Id.removeClass("dx-checkbox-checked");
                Id.removeClass("dx-checkbox-indeterminate");
                Id.attr("aria-checked", "false");
                Id.children().attr("aria-checked", "false");
                Id.children().children().attr("aria-checked", "false");
                Id.children().removeClass("dx-checkbox-checked");
                Id.children().removeClass("dx-checkbox-indeterminate");
                Id.children().children().removeClass("dx-checkbox-checked");
                Id.children().children().removeClass("dx-checkbox-indeterminate");
            }
            else if (State == "P") { //for Partial check
                Id.removeClass("dx-checkbox-checked");
                Id.addClass("dx-checkbox-indeterminate");
                Id.attr("aria-checked", "mix");
                Id.children().attr("aria-checked", "mix");
                Id.children().removeClass("dx-checkbox-checked");
                Id.children().children().removeClass("dx-checkbox-checked");
                Id.children().addClass("dx-checkbox-indeterminate");
                Id.children().children().addClass("dx-checkbox-indeterminate");
            }
            else if (State == "F") { //For Fully check
                Id.addClass("dx-checkbox-checked");
                Id.removeClass("dx-checkbox-indeterminate");
                Id.attr("aria-checked", "true");
                Id.children().attr("aria-checked", "true");
                Id.children().removeClass("dx-checkbox-indeterminate");
                Id.children().addClass("dx-checkbox-checked");
                Id.children().children().addClass("dx-checkbox-checked");
                Id.children().children().removeClass("dx-checkbox-indeterminate");
            }
Where Id -> td id where checkbox present with class - '.dx-command-select'
But now this code is not working well. So we have to call repaint after any selection change.
Which is costly and due to that some functionality is not working well.
I need solution for this. how to set checkbox state manually by jquery.
Please see attached screenshot for wrong state of selctall checkbox.
There is no child check and it is calling above code of jquery to uncheck this checkbox. But after our code executed it is again fully checked. This is wrong.



Additionally I have a field of memo type 
Can this field in the edit form increase i t's height automatically as the content increases ?
Can this memo field in the edit form be resized by the user ?
Thank you

Buttons placed inside the devex grid template shows html instead of title.
Kindly refer the attached image. 

Hi,

 I attached a file for your reference. Hope you can help. Thank you. 

Hello,
I have treelists one as a source tree list and other treelists views acts as destination for node droping. Source tree list is bind at design time. But the child tree lists are added at runtime. I have written the InsertBrunch method as follows:
private void InsertBrunch(TreeList list, TreeListNode node, int parent)
        {
            try
            {
                ArrayList data = new ArrayList();
                foreach (TreeListColumn column in node.TreeList.Columns)
                    data.Add(node[column]);
                parent = list.AppendNode(data.ToArray(), parent).Id;
                if (node.HasChildren)
                    foreach (TreeListNode n in node.Nodes)
                        InsertBrunch(list, n, parent);
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
            }
        }
But, parent = list.AppendNode(data.ToArray(), parent).Id; this id i am getting null. And it throws object reference not set to instance of object exception.
Will you please tell me why this is happening? 

Hello
I have a question to the XtraScheduler-control for WinForms-applications:
I must Change my Scheduler-Application to write data in a History- Table for appointments-changes. If a date or time is changed, the previous data state should be archived from the appointment.
Manual changes in the appointment-form, and also drag/drop-changes from an appointment in the Scheduler.
Is it po ssible to get the original-values from an appointment in the "SchedulerStorage_AppointmentChanging"-Event or the "SchedulerStorage_AppointmentsChanged"-Event?
Please, have you a clue for my question - how I could best solve this.
Many thanks in advance for your help && best regards,
Michael

Dear Sir/Madam:
    Hi,I just bought the product “DevExpressVCLProducts-17.2.4”from your company,and it was really slow to use it to read and write data.It takes fifty seconds to read and write 8500 datas with your product,while it only needs 5 seconds to use “F1Book6”to do this.Usually,we need to deal with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands data.I do not think it can process anymore in this case.Plase help me to solve this problem?

All right:
Consider this:
    class TestClass
    {
      public string B;// { get; set; }
      public string A;// { get; set; }
      public double Val;// { get; set; }
    }
     public static void testDynamicPivot2(PivotGridControl pivot)
    {
      var field1 = new PivotGridField() { AreaIndex = 0, FieldName = "A", Name = "fieldA" };
      var field2 = new PivotGridField() { AreaIndex = 1, FieldName = "B", Name = "fieldB" };
      var field3 = new PivotGridField() { AreaIndex = 2, FieldName = "Val", Name = "fieldVal", Area = PivotArea.DataArea };
      pivot.Fields.AddRange(new PivotGridField[] { field1, field2, field3 });
      var ds = new BindingList<TestClass>();
      for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        ds.Add(new TestClass() { A = "A", B = "B", Val = i + 0.5 });
      pivot.DataSource = ds;
      pivot.Refresh();
    }
result is : I do 
see the sum(Val) in the pivot I give as parameter.
 Now if I define TestClass with getters/setters like this
    class TestClass
    {
      public string B; { get; set; }
      public string A; { get; set; }
      public double Val; { get; set; }
    }
Then I 
see the sum(Val).
now consider the same with ExpandoObject:
    public static void testDynamicPivot1(PivotGridControl pivot)
    {
      var field1 = new PivotGridField() { AreaIndex = 0, FieldName = "A", Name = "fieldA" };
      var field2 = new PivotGridField() { AreaIndex = 1, FieldName = "B", Name = "fieldB" };
      var field3 = new PivotGridField() { AreaIndex = 2, FieldName = "Val", Name = "fieldVal", Area = PivotArea.DataArea };
      pivot.Fields.AddRange(new PivotGridField[] { field1, field2, field3 });
      var ds = new BindingList<ExpandoObject>();
      for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      {
        var properties = new Dictionary<string, object>();
        properties["A"] = "aa";
        properties["B"] = "bb";
        properties["Val"] = i+0.5;
        var dynObj = DynObject.getDynamicObject(properties);
        ds.Add(dynObj);
      }
      pivot.DataSource = ds;
      pivot.Refresh();
    }
with:
    public static dynamic getDynamicObject(Dictionary<string, object> properties)
    {
      dynamic myobject = new ExpandoObject();
      IDictionary<string, object> myUnderlyingObject = myobject;
      foreach (var kvp in properties)
        myUnderlyingObject.Add(kvp.Key, kvp.Value);
      return myobject;
    }
Result is : I do 
see sum(Val)
My conclusion is : I miss getters and setters in my dynamic object.
Am I right ? if so, how can I create getters/setters on my dynamic fields A,B and Val ?
Thank you
  

Hello,
we  are developing an application in which some data are received real time and are shown in a chart using 7 different series on the same chart (only 3 of them are visible at the same time but we prepare all of them using Visible=false).
We have a new x,y point every 10ms (for every serie) and a total of 30-60s of data to draw.
We receive about 30-40 points for each serie at the same time and we add them one by one to series using AddPoint(x,y).
When the chart is empty  the first 5 sec of data (500 points for each serie) are shown in an acceptable real time.
The problem is that after 6 sec of data it becomes slow. The AddPoint(x,y) function tackes a lot of time to complete. It seems like the chart require more time to draw data and the gap increments when the total number of points increase.
After 20 seconds of data the gap is about 5-7 sec.
Hoping in a quick reply and in a solution for this issue.
Another question about this type of chart: how to fix the x-axis to the last 10s of data? I've already add the Xnavigation bar and the user are able to zoom and scroll the data but we need to show the last 10sec while data are drawn.
Thanks
Best regards.

Hello,
I am trying to retrieve fields of DataSource but retrieve fields does not work. I paused application and recorded immediate window of Visual Studio below. 
 

I have a data model with many-to-many relationship (one Company can have many Roles, One role can be assigned to many Companies).
I would like to implement a DataGrid with Edit Form conatining multiple selection Drop Down Box to assogn Roles to COmpany when adding a new record.
How can I pass a data from controller ang how should I bind it to Drop Down Box ?
How should I process data in POST and PUT actions to receive and process array of selected records?
Do you have any example of multiple selection Drop Down Box in DataGrid's edit for?

I would like add a blank row above header row while exporting TableView to excel. Could you please let me know is there a direct way to customize the export functionality to add such functionality.

I have a TcxGridDBBandedTableView as a timeline with different TcxEditRepositoryComboBoxItem to edit the datasets. This works fine.
Now I'm scrolling to an exact column:



After scrolling the TcxEditRepositoryComboBoxItem do not popup anymore. If I scroll manually the popup works again.

Hello,
I want to know how to obtain the cell text that actually fits in the visible spreadsheet cell .
In the attached project, exists the cell D5 with the following text:
In Excel and  also in the SpreadsheetControl we can see that the Text that actually fits is not showing the Line 4.
I want to know how the Export to PDF can know that visible text, because I want to export the Spreasheet content to Open Office (XML) as a table, and when I use the "D5" Worksheet["D5"].ExistingCells.FirstOrDefault().DisplayText is giving me all the text of the cell, but I don't know which is the best way to know the Text that actually is visible in the D5 cell height and width...
Could you help me?
Thanks in advance!!!

Good morning.

Hi again,
 
This issue is related to issue 
. We found that the Chart Designer is not suited for our end-users. 
Our preferred approach is to supply the users with the ability to switch SeriesTemplate using a combo-box. 
 
In the attached project I'd like to be able to switch between AreaFullStackedSeries2D, BarSideBySideSeries2D and LineSeries2D using the combo-box. I was hoping it would be possible to use the XYDiagram2D.SeriesItemTemplateSelector for this. But I haven't been able to get it to work.
 
Can you please help me out here?
Regards
Petter Ballandby
 

In some cases, It doesn't work. 
I've implemented SingleChoiseAction which contains  just one ChoiceActionItem in some cases (I fill it dynamically).
In these cases, dropdown icon is hidden and SingleChoiceAction.ShowItemsOnClick property is ignored. Therefore, users are confused because they see only action with default caption (instead enum value caption).
 The issue just related to XAF Web. In win version I never had that problem (see attach).
Could you suggest any workaround  for Web UI bug? (17.2.4 version)

Dear Support!
We have an "overcomplicated" navigation bar (TdxNavBar).
We use more subgroups in it.
We have "A" and "B" link in Navbar, and "A"/"B" functions in the background.
"A" makes a dialog, and it have button can call "B". In "B" dialog we have button that call "A".
In the buttons I search for the another NavBar link, and I select it.
Yesterday my boss moved these two links (A, B) into separated subgroups. Now they are far in position.
After this I the "Select" function don't make the another link visible.
The link is selected, but the view not scrolled to needed area.
So I'm in dialog "A", and I push the button "B". 
After the form close I navigate to "B" link, I selected it. 
The function started, but the "B" link don't visible in the upper area, the scrollbar remains on original position.
I found "MakeLinkVisible" function in Navbar, but it have strange effects or it have not effects. :-(
We have more other problems with this NavBar, and I suspect these subgroups cause them.
(Expands/collapses makes wrong scrollbar, the control is not well formatted)
 Subgroup:
I have created a demo application.
I dynamically create a dxNavBar with groups, and subgroups.
The subgroup items everytime created  in 14. item (0 based).
When you search without subgroups, for example, 5. group / 12. element - the selection is ok, and you can see this item (MakeVisible is working well).
Next you search with subgroup, for example: 3. group, 14. element (you need to use it as constant), and 5. subelement.
The group changes. The selected element is ok. But it is not visible. The control remains in previous state.
You can scroll down with scrollbar, and you can see the element, it is selected, but the MakeLinkVisible isn't working.
I hope you can also see this problem in the demo.
Thank your for any help!

***** This is actually a question about the DASHBOARD designer / viewer, but I didn't see anything in the Product box that matched that *****
I  am building a dashboard using a Postgres SQL datasource and an MVC front-end.
This is a multi-tenant system, so I use a tenant-id as a dashboard parameter - that is working fine - that will be hidden and inaccessible to the users.
Every visualisation widget and filter widget on the dashboard is filtered by the tenant id (trustId) however, I want one visualisation widget to be filtered by the dashboard parameter, and also the results of two filter widgets.  
1. I have setup a master filter using the "range" filter for the time period applicable to the tenant (ie the range filter is itself filtered by tenant-id)
2. I have setup a combobox widget covering the multiple item-types that are to be summed over time. These item-types are filtered by the master filter (they vary by tenant - each tenant only sees their own item types) and this displays correctly.
3. I have a chart widget which shows a series of stacked bars, summed by month by cohort.  This chart component needs to be filtered by (1) and (2).  
4. I can successfully apply the master filter to the chart widget by applying the parameter filter using the dashboard tenant-id parameter.
5. When I try to apply the item type filter, I always see something like the attached - "guide" is my item type and it appears in the list many many times.
(This display is the same whether I use listbox, combobox or tree filter for the item types - all of them display the filter correctly, but none appear correctly in the filter option)
I am assuming I am doing this wrong, and there is a different way to apply the selected values from a filter to a chart widget somehow? However, I can't find an example where multiple different filter sources are used to filter a single widget. 

Hello DevExpress team,
Please, have a look at a screenshot.
Is it somehow possible to align some toolbar items to the left and some to the right within one toolbar?
We had till now all items aligned to the right
Now we want to add new item 'Actions' which should be aligned to the left.
As i understood, it can be done with another toolbar, but another toolbar row looks not nice. Maybe there is some nicer way to configure the toolbar?
Thank you,
Aleksandr. 

When  performing a bookkeeping program, any unnecessary mouse click is  redundant and must be reduced to a lesser extent due to the speed of  typing the operator. Is there a possibility that  immediately after clicking on the UPDATE button on the parent table, you  immediately open a new children's form ready to insert data with focus  on the first item in the form. And after clicking on the  UPDATE button in the child's form, it saves the data and immediately  opens a new child form with focus on the first item? In this way, the operators on the program greatly accelerate the data entry without excessive mouse clicks. And  so every time until a click on the CANCEL button, then the child form  does not open automatically after the form has been quashed. 

Hello,
we are developping  an Energy Trading System with XPO as ORM Mapper.
We have customers with about 350000  trades per year. 90% of the trades are assigned to one customer.
When loading one customer with many trades assigned XPO seems to load the whole trade collection which lasts very long even if the data is not beeing accessed.
Is there a way to implement lazy loading so that the collection of the trade will be filled when it is being acessed?.
Thanks

Hello Team,
I have a model with the information format as below:
Class 1: 
# Males = 25 
# Females = 2 0
# Passed =  35
Class 2: 
# Males = 15 
# Females = 2 0
# Passed =  25
....
I am trying to show the information in Side-by-Side Stacked Bar format. It is a bit different from the example of Side-by-Side Stacked Bar in the demo, as the two groups are related but different. A basic code snippet, to implement such a requirement would be very helpful. Also, please find attached image to clarify the requirement.
 

When I click on a specific row area of the pivot, I want to get the summary values of the selected cells.
 
The PivotDrillDownDataSource function is very inefficient because it needs to find all the clicked values and calculate summary value.
 
The PivotSummaryDataSource function is very inefficient because the developer has to calcurate summary value if the cell is not collapsed. Also the data corresponding to the clicked cell must be filtered.
 
When I click the row area of the pivot, multiple cells are selected. With the pivot function, the sum or average is calculated when the area is folded. 
It also provides a pivot function that allows you to view summation values for each column or row.
Can you use the information to solve the following problems?
 
The exact function I want is:
1. Get the information of the cells corresponding to the clicked row area.
2. I want to get the sum or average summary value that appears when the row area is collapsed even if the row area is not collapsed. Data is taken in the form of a Datatable.
Do you have an API to do this? Or seek advice.

Dear support,
My current data bound scheduler implementation uses a custom appointment edit form and business objects for mapping the needed fields. I have the following questions regarding reminders and the "ReminderInfo" property.
1. On the custom appointment edit form how can I set a default value on all new appointments (e.g. 15 minutes)?
2. How can I extent the available values on the reminders list? On Outlook there are more options compared with the ones given on the reminder control and I want them to be similar for sync reasons.
3. On the main form that the scheduler control is located, I'm using the events "AppointmentsInserted", "AppointmentsChanged" and "AppointmentsDeleted" to execute the needed CRUD operations on the corresponding business objects. The problem I'm facing is that I cannot fetch the "ReminderInfo" data to store them in the DB. There is no "ReminderInfo" property under the "Appointment" class to get the needed data. I want them as string and not as XML. Basically, I need something similar like the implementation you have for the "RecurrenceInfo" property.
Best regards,
Andreas

I upgraded a web application from 2017.1.8.0 to 2017.2.5.0 and the scheduler's tooltip looks quite different.
I checked the breaking changes when  for this version update and noticed that indeed there are some changes when it comes to tooltips. However, it is not clear to me how to revert to the 'old' layout. Could you  drop me a line? Thanks.
This is how it's currently implemented:
 

Hi,
In a DBTableGrid I have two columns of Property "DateEdit" . Both also show time.
Of the two only date and time of Enddatetime can be changed. 
After the user pressed on the OK-button in the dateedit-editor, the entered date must be validated.  Column Enddatetime  must always be after  Startdatetime.
If the date/time is not valid I want to keep the inplace DateEdit-editor open or re-open it (see attached image).
The code below does place the editor in the column, but it doesn't show the DateEdit-editor.
 Ideally when pressing the OK-button in de DateEdit-editor the date will be validated and if not valid a errormessage is shown and the editor remains open.
Thanks! 

Hi there
We are using Xaf using XPO. We have specified a baseclass that contains some properties like changedby and changedat etc. How can I exclude this properties from showing up in locking exceptions? I've experimented with setting the optimisticlockingreadbehavior and we have set the trackpropertymodifications property to true in XpoDefault. 
So how can I exclude the changedby and changedat properties? These properties must be overwriten in any case.
I also want to note that the behavior around locking exceptions is not wel documented for Xaf. For example: How can I determine wich properties are conflicting when I'm getting a LockingException that cannot be merged? I've made a controller for this and got it working after very much research. But I think this must be a standard feature in Xpo or Xaf.  It is also very unclear wich attributes I can use in my business classes that influence the Locking behavior. In some tickets it is stated that I can use attributes to decorate my classes and properties to change the locking behavior. In other tickets I'm reading that this attributes do not work for Xaf. So can you please clarify if there are any attributes that influence the locking behavior? And can you maybe create a new or update a KB with more information about Locking exceptions and ways to control this is Xaf.
Thanks,
Jacob 

After upgrading from 16.2.6 to 17.2.4 I get this EClassNotFound error in TcxCustomGridView.RestoreFromRegistry.
I initially thought this had to with settings stored under 16.2.6 and restored under 17.2.4, but after executing TcxCustomGridView.StoreToRegistry under 17.2.4, the problem persists.
FWIW, the data being stored:
  AStorageName '\Software\TimeTell\ontwikkel\Forms\TDialoogEditAgenda_123\GridDienstRoostersDBTableView'
  ARecreate True
  Options [gsoUseSummary]
  ASaveViewName ''
  AOwnerName ''
and the attached screenshot shows the contents of that registry key  
The funny thing is, if I e.g. switch two columns or change sort order I see that these get restored nicely.
What can be going on or is there anything I can try?
We do not use conditional formatting.
This is in a complex app, so I have not made a sample project yet.
Another TcxGridConditionalFormattingProvider issue was reported here: 
but seems unrelated and has been fixed in 17.2.4

I'm testing your WPF components for future using. I'm converting some classes from my WinForms classes. In WinForm classes I have a print preview classes. When I use that class I can get print preview from a GridView with auto column width. When I change margins then columns are fit the new size. But WPF component doesnt. I set AutoWidth and PrintAutoWidth to true of GridControl. When show the print preview first time columns are fit the page but columns dont fit (again) to page when I change margins. Also columns changes (fit again to new size) when I change page oriantation or margins in Page Setup on Print Preview ribbon. I cant find any evets like margins changed in that class. if it is not a bug then how can I do that behavior when the user change the margins lik Winforms Control?

Good morning, I?'ve a question about TcxGrid.
I? need to create dynamically a grid at with I assign a "copy" of an existing grid created in a frame. Here is my code:
The function GetDocGrid is some this like this:
Where grdF24 is the name of the grid present in the frame named fraListF24.
The problem is that when I try to execute the ExportGridToExcel routine I get an "Access violation" error. So my question is: is it possible to clone an existing grid to a new one created on the fly?
Thanks for your answer.

Hi,
I have a gridview on my page with the paging section.
I want to add a button to collapse and expand the paging info section of the gridview in demand of the user.
Is there any solution for this? 
I have not found any built in functionality for this.
Thanks,

Hi!
I am facing certain problem with implementing "Undoable" action with rich edit control.
 So the feature is folowing:
1) When the space is pressed the code searches the word before the caret  which consist of letters/digits only ([\w\d]+);
2) If there is any configured replacement for the word  then the word in the editor is replaced with the configured replacement text + space symbol.
That part work well.
But then there is another requirement:
When user right after the "automatic replacement"  presses the Backspace key the editor should change last replaced range back to the "word" and the cursor stays after the space which is following that "word".
Example:
1) User types "wtf";
2) user presses space and editor now contains "what the flower " (with space in the end); 
3) Now if user presses backspace then the editor should contain "wtf "  (with space in the end).
This very easy only while there is no line-breaks in the replacement text!My first thought was to use the Undo and then just append space to the caret position, but Undo via calling dxRichEditControl.Undo  (neither via DocumentModel or DocumentModel.History).
The code above is used to replace the found "word" with the configured text - so as you see the Document.Replace method is used.
One more strange thing is that Ctrl+Z does undo that, but not Document.Undo!
Thank you in advance!

Hallo
Using CommandBarStyle="Ribbon" for the SpreadsheetControl, is it possible to use another look for the buttons  other than "flat"?
Ideally I want the same look that RichEditControl creates.
Or is the only option to generate the ribbon control?

Hi Team,
We have a popup with a combobox and one grid. The grid data is based on the combobox selection.  
Currently we have given the autopostback true for the combobox. 
so whenever we select an item in the combobox it performs a postback and fills the grid.
 Our issue is like, when this postback happens the popup vanishes and reappears. How can we handle this situation. PFA , which explains the issue better than words.
 Thanks in advance!

Dear Support Team,
I am using MVC with DevExpress Gridview. Now for some requirement i have to use DevExtreme data grid for some of the pages.
In DevExpress Gridview i was using one dropdown where all the other format was present. Based on the user selection of format he was getting the same format of report. In this export merging column issue has been fixed also.
How could i achieve the same functionality of export in DevExtreme grid also.
Please find the attachement of sampel file where export functionality used.
Please let me know if you have  any concern.

Hello,
I have an angular project which uses controls from devextreme and devextreme-angular packages (version 17.2.5).
In several components I use devextreme models such as dxDataGridColumn, dxDataGridOptions.
To use these models I import dx.all.d.ts definition file using following statement:
Project compiles correctly.
Now I am trying to add karma/jasmine tests to the project and had received following error while trying to run tests:

I've prepared a simple example based on karma-typescript project: 
I've added devextreme and devextreme-angular dependencies and added DevExpress.ui.dxDataGridColumn field to HelloComponent.
 If you run 'karma start' you'll receive the same error.

Hi
 I have a button that calls the AddNewRecord method on a VGridControl.  
If I click the button a new record is created and I can then focus the new record with the mouse.
If MultiSelect is set to true I cannot click into the cells of the new record to edit them and neither can I show any in place editors.  
If I press Return with a cell in the new row selected and then click into the cell the functionality returns to normal and I can edit the cells normally.
If I click on to a different record and then back to the new row  the functionality returns to normal and I can edit the cells normally.
Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong?
Thanks 

Hi, 
I want to make a scenario with cascading comboboxes. I have a page that i am using for insert and update new data . But there are cascading comboboxes inside it. The inserting is ok but when i try to update the data the model binding is not working that i am expected. 
I am filling the model and passing it to the combobox partials . I want  to fill all the combobox data and select the id that i sent from my model. 
This is my first combobox
In this first combobox i am assigning the value that i get from the model. And on combobox init i perform a callback to other combobox to fill the data 
But after filling the second combobox i can't assign the value that i get from the model . This is my second combobox
And this is my screencast 
Can you provide me a working sample please about this scenario. Thank you so much.

I am using a DevExpress.XtraBars.Docking.DockManager. When the user exits the application, I  use the function SaveToStream() to store the current layout the user has created, and when he logs in again, I use RestoreLayoutFromStream() to load his last layout again. Most of the time, this is working fine. But however, sometimes it seems that the data I have stored before and give as a parameter to the RestoreLayoutFromStream() method is damaged and the restore method leads to a layout where all dockable panels are closed.
Is there any possibility how I can get an info that the  RestoreLayoutFromStream() method failed? Cause the method has return type void and it does not throw any exception when the data stored at the stream can not be processed. Would be very helpful to identify this situation, I would then be able to restore a default layout and maybe give a message to the user.

Hi,
I am building an application to publish a large number of a variety of reports. We have just migrated to a new banking system and we have around 250 reports that are being created as stored procedures from a data warehouse. The application should be able to deliver the record sets from the  called sp to any user in a grid view, enabling them to manipulate the data and eventually download the result as Excel file.
To achieve this I used a ASPX grid view with the property 'Auto generate columns' not defining any columns which is hidden in an ASPX Popup control. The user may or may not have to provide parameters to execute the stored procedure called referenced in the SQL data source for the grid view control. the stored procedure will return different report outputs depending on the parameter 'SPROC' which is linked to the report title in the list box. So far the application works as expected - a user can select a report and the grid view provides the requested data, however there are two issues with the nature of the SQL data source in this application:
* after running a report switching to another report will cause an error when providing new parameters - an error message indicates that a column from the previous run report is not available - this happens on the post back event after changing the index on the list box. I can avoid this message using the back button on my browser going all the way back to the first page and then selecting a new report will work - question: what method do I need to use to reset the SQL data source on the client side? I would like to reset on the close event of the popup control. I tried to insert a reload <ClientSideEvents CloseButtonClick="document.location.reload(true)" /> which caused a continuous reload cycle. What script command would I need to use to achieve the same after closing the popup?
* after entering the parameters on the last post-back the user will have to wait some time for the parameters to upload and the data set to download. I can see the activity on Chrome at the bottom left (Uploading / Waiting) after the page has reloaded I can click 'Open report' to reveal the popup and data will appear in the grid view, if I don't wait until this process is finished the popup will already open but the grid view will be empty. How can I time the popup to wait for the process to finish? Can I insert a progress bar to indicate that a data load process is running and the user has to wait? Ideally I would like to have a progress bar showing right after click 'Open report'. I understand that the event  <ClientSideEvents Click="function (s,e) {GridPopup.Show();}" /> happens on the client side - how can I time the open event based on the successful completion of the load of the record set into the SQL data source?
Thanks,
Kai

Good afternoon.
How can i solve the following error:  
?
I've been upgrading from 14.1 to 17.2.
The source code: 
could you please help me?
Thanks in advance. 

Hello.
I have checked several topics, but don't found any regarding object permissions merging.
My steps to reproduce:
- I have Administrators and Default default roles. 
- Default role has read rights for own user only (defined with OBjectPerimission with criteria). 
- if I add both roles to a user, then I can't see another user, although I have no RolesMergingMode.GrantedInAllRoles because I am on 17.2.4 yet.
In other words I have access for all users in Administrators role, but Default role is denied it by ObjectPermissions.
 
So looks like it works only fot type permissions, althought it is looks logically for me: if I have one role with granted access to an object and another one role denied it, then for RolesMergingMode.GrantedInAnyRole I should have Allow access, instead of deny (like it done for types permissions).

If this is possible, please let me know how to do it.

Hi DX Team, 
is there a way to set styles with EditSettings based on RowData.Row binding? I mean I might have property like "IsDefault" in my object and I want to set binding for editors like this:

But it does not affect the editors.
I know the CellTemplate gives me that ability quit easily but EditSettings was recommended for me under 
 ticket.
If you have better way of doing it, I'm open to your solutions, but please keep them under MVVM design pattern.

Hello Support,
Can you please help in finding answers of below questions:
1. Is it possible to  use scripting with ExecutionMode.Restricted in MVC 5 without going thorough you mentioned here ?
Basically We do not want to run Report Viewer & Designer in separate domain.
2. Is it possible to enable scripting in report designer conditional. I want to enable it for only specific users and it should be hidden for rest of the users ?
3.  Is it possible to implement some sort of validation in script editor, so user can write only report related stuff like lable's BeforePrint event and so on ?
User should not able to write stuff like delete files, start some new process, etc.
Than You.

Guys,
I cannot set UserCellPadding. It's like this property doesn't exist. 
In GridView class I found this:
        //
        // Summary:
        //     Gets or sets a Padding structure by which the default cell padding is adjusted.
        [Browsable(false)]
        [DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Hidden)]
        [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
        public Padding UserCellPadding { get; set; }
How can I use this property?
Thanks,

Hi,
i've got a DXTabControl with dynamically adds DXTabItems.
The View property is declared as following:
The method for adding a DXTabItem is:
In XAML I created a command binding, which directs to a method CloseTabCmd_Executed:
The methods signature looks like the following:
Until this point everything works as expected. I set a breakpoint inside the executed method and debugger stops inside the method.
If I'm going to inspect the ExecutedRoutedEventArgs with the built in tools in VS the Source object differs from the one I clicked before.
For example if there are two Tabs and I'm going to click the first one, the second Tab will be the Source of the event (and vice versa).
Am I doing any mistakes while using the .CloseCommand property together with View's property RemoveTabsOnHiding?
Or is this maybe a known bug?
Thanks in advance!
EDIT: Updated method CreateNewTabItem()

Hi DevExpress,
I'm currently testing your Xamarin grid. My goal is to add several buttons to each row. I used your 
 sample and it seems to be working. However, if grid has set RowEditMode to Popup, ScreenArea or GridArea and I double-tap to invoke the edit mode, I get NullReferenceException exception.
Attached please find my demo app. Am I missing something or is it a bug? I'm using latest Xamarin.Forms version.
Kind regards

Hello,
I've noticed a behaviour with the XtraReport, if I open a report with a simple data parameters,  for example a sales report between 2 date ranges, the report appears correct. If I then make a sale, go back to the report (which was left open) and simply press the 'Submit' button in the parameters panel, the additional sale does not appear, I need to close and open the report. Is there a way to resolve this?

Team,
How can we set the Active and Inactive tab color when the theme is applied.
Thanks in advance! 

Hello Team,
I am using tab control as part of my view as illustrated in the demo: "
" .
But, I am using it, in a way, where each tab has its own partial view. So, the first tab has a grid view, the second tab has a different grid view and so on. And since there is considerable data in each tab, I would like to load the data only on the tab click. Please suggest a way to achieve this, as I could not find a way to raise a click event on changing the tab. 
Please find the code snippet below. I am trying to fetch the Grid 2 data only on the tab click. Is there a way to achieve this?
@Html.DevExpress().PageControl(
    settings => {
        settings.Name = "pcFeatures";
        
        settings.TabPages.Add("Grid 1").SetContent(() => {
            ViewContext.Writer.Write("<div style='text-align: left'>");                            Html.RenderPartial("Grid1PartialView", Model.Grid1Details);
                           ViewContext.Writer.Write("</div>");
                });
        settings.TabPages.Add("Grid 2").SetContent(() => {
            ViewContext.Writer.Write("<div style='text-align: left'>");                            Html.RenderPartial("Grid2PartialView", Model.Grid2Details);
                           ViewContext.Writer.Write("</div>");
                });
        });
}).GetHtml() 

Hi, 
I'd like to disable (or replace) menu which appears when user clicks second mouse button during editing cell. How to do it? Setting Handled in OnContextPopup event does not work.

Hi,
I need to develop a way of prevent users from opening a Task object in DetailView , if the same object is being viewed by another user.
I will be storing the ID of the user and the Workstation Name in the Task when it is first opened providing the values for these are currently Null.
I will be using a View Controller and thinking of using the OnViewControlsCreated event to perform this task.
The part I need help on is when the detail view is opened and I check if User and Workstation are Not Null, how do I then close the detail view after displaying a warning to the User that somebody is currently viewing the Task?
Secondly, I need a way of setting the User and Workstation to Null when the detail view is closed and commit the changes, so which event should I use for this?
 

Team,
I am using devexpress treeview to show data on the UI. The Columns are  getting re-generated every time we change the item source as because the number of columns can change .I am using the banded view to display the data.
Grid loads the data faster if it has 10-15 columns or number of column visible to view port. No issues here.
Though, If we have more than 30-35 column with 5 bands . it slows down drastically. It takes close to 15 second to load 30 column even if you have only 2-3 rows to display.
I have added the following code to defer the grid events , but still it's taking significant amount(10 seconds) to load the data.
 AssociatedObject.BeginDataUpdate();
                var view = AssociatedObject.View as TreeListView;
                view.BestFitMaxRowCount = CommonConstants.DefaultBestFitRowCount;
                 view.BestFitColumns();
 AssociatedObject.EndDataUpdate();
Pleased help.

Hello, I'm drawing 2 linear level bars one near the other, they show a balancing value divided for left and right.
Here's the XAML code:
How can I change the color of bars? Setting a different color for each bar?
How can I modify the width of the bar ad make it wider?
Now I've put the 2 bars one near the other, but both of them has the numeric scale visible. How can I hide one of them and maintain only one scale for both bars?
Thanks, best regards.
 

Hi Team,
I am using a nonpersistent class detail view binded to the nav item. I have "User" dropdown on top of the grid in this detail view.  I wanted to change the records in the grid depending on the dropdown value selected for User but I also wanted to set the current user as the default user selected in the dropdown and record should appear according to that. I am using window authentication for my application.
I am having problem while setting filters for grid and during setting current user as a default User. Getting exception all the time.
kindly, go through the codes and let me know how to set it.
Thanks.
 

Hi DevExpress,
I'm currently evaluating your Xamarin grid control. I would like to ask you, if it is somehow possible to customize the grouped row template. Basically, I need to add one or two buttons to each grouped row. Based on your documentation, I suppose this is currently not possible. Or is there a way how to achieve it?
Thanks.
Kind regards

Hi, I'm trying to create a small Chart control showing 2 series of 2 points each. The available space is limited to 200x128px.
Here's the XAML
The labels on X axis are not visible, or only Ecc is visible. Is it possible to fix the data to show on axis? And is it a way to change the font-size of the labels on axis?
Due to the small space, is it possible to reduce the width of each Bar? And the space between two different x-points?
Finally, how can I modify the color of the Bars of each serie? The automatic color method is fine but I need to use red for the first serie anc blue for the second one.
Thanks. regards.
 

I have been reading this article as we are implementing unit integration tests into our application, but the references appear to not be up to date for the current version of XPO. How do we implement integration tests in XAF and XPO applications and does DevExpress still support the use of NUnit to do this? 

We regularly receive Toolbox Analyzer logs indicating that users try to install older DevExpress builds in non-supported Visual Studio versions (for example, see 
). Let's clearly visualize that certain DevExpress builds cannot be installed in specific Visual Studio versions.

We are preparing to move our project to ver 17.2, so we are allready on version 16.1 and i think there is a bug in version17.2 ASPxScheduler control.
First time at initialization binding when  event DataBinding is fired but it doesn't fire a 
 event!
So on large data models (your sample!), where internal sql variables values are ini tialized in 
 event is rising SQL error. I think this is a bug, then every DataBind should fire a 
 event before executing ResourceDataSource and AppointmentDataSource queries.
Sa?a 

Is it possible to set Min and Max value for ValueAxis in PolarChar or only to set MinValueMargin and MaxValueMargin?

Hi guys,
I am leaving a comment here to notify that this problem seems to have come back.
We're currently using v.17.2.5 (devextreme and devextreme-angular packages), but like Chris wrote two years ago, this is easily reproduced on your 
 with any TagBox, using iOS Safari on iPad / iPhone.

Hi folks,
i created a BO named DraftState (Properties: Name (string), SortIndex (int)). 
The table is prefilled with 3 draft states . Each draft state as an unique, running number (e.g. 0,1,2).
It is possible for the end user to delete predefined draft state. It should be also allowed to add or reorder draft states.
What is the recommended approach to handle this features? 
To let the user update the sort index via spinEditControl is awful. Maybe there is a better way? 
How can i guarantee, that there is no gap between the sort index values (0,2,3,19), neither duplicated sort index values?
Thanks,
Micha

I would like get the source code along with the data behind the demo at: 
.  Is this available?
I am running v17.1.  I need it for MVC  (not Web Forms).  Thank you!
Edit: Additionally, if the data is in a format that is editable, that would be a huge plus. 


                                To display an image or text in the resource header, create a custom template and assign it to the 
 property. 
The 
 object has no property that contains an associated image, so use 
 to obtain an image when necessary.
The resulting application is shown below.

                            

I am using this to create a drop-down control on the right side of the RibbonControl:
My problem is the Width binding on the embedded Grid control.  I want the drop-down width to match the width of the control in the ribbon, as well as making it so that the buttons align right (vertically).  But no matter how I bind that Width, I either get something that looks like "auto" (the drop-down items have inconsistent widths) , or I get something wider than the ribbon's control.  The attached image shows both results.  The left image is the sort of alignment I need, but limited to the width of the control in the ribbon.
I have tried binding to both "Width" and "ActualWidth" and on both "BarButtonItemLinkControl" and "BarSubItemLinkControl".
How can I make this work?

 Attached is a lousy sample project, but it will do the job for explaining the problem I have with a real application.
Focus on the date and time fields on the detail form - upper part. These are binded to the same property in our ViewModel - users want to have two controls, one for the date and one for the timepart.
In codebehind an event fires if time entered is more than five minutes old. Then a suggestion of changing the date to next day will appear as messagebox - see attachment, word-doc.
The event fires correctly, but what's displayed in the time field behind the messagebox is a little bit out of sync, and I can't figure out why, or what to do for that matter.
To illustrate
Time Now: 15:36
I enter: 15:31
Field displays: 15:03
The control will let me type 15:31 (or just 31 in the last two positions), but when the messagebox displays, the content  which is displayed 15:03? At the same time the EditValue has the right value otherwise the event would not trigger.
EditValueChanged with this type of binding is troublesome. User should have full freedom of typing until he or she leaves the field. An old tool I used in the past had what they called a Validate Event: Captured 'FocusLost' and 'ValueChanged' in one event.
I also tried to modify the binding: UpdateSourceTrigger=LostFocus. No different behaviour 
Thanks in advance for any help.
 

Hi,
We are using your beautiful MVC Dashboard and we have a question regarding the Export functionality.
We are using a grid from which we export the data in an Excel file. When the data is too big, a notification message is shown indicating that not all data was loaded in order to improve performance. So we are wondering, at this point or in this case,  when we click the Export button,  would all data be exported from the database? Or only the data visible in the UI?
It looks like upon clicking the Export button, the data will be retrieved again from the database, but we are not sure whether it retrieves data that matches the data visible in the UI.
Another question is whether it is possible to export data in CSV format
Thank you,
Best, Fadi

Hello,
I have a .NET core 2.0 project, which uses DevExtreme.
Based on this ticket 
I understand that DevExtreme does not support Captcha, but there seems to be a way to use the "Captcha for ASP.NET MVC" in a .NET Core project.
If that is true, would you please provide me an sample project?

I am having issues with the text blurring on my webDocumentViewer, until now I was using DocumentViewer but we had an issue with text splitting (see this 
) and was directed to webDocumentViewer where the problem only exists in the PDF export but that is not the issue right now.
I need to find a way to stop the text blur, I only get a clear inage at 80% or 175% zoom on Chrome(Version 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit)) which ~90% of our users are on. I have spent a whole day now drifting through your support threads not really finding anything that can help me with the issue and I have followed your demo example to the best of my ability.
We are using our clients own font here, but we never had this issue on DocumentViewer so it shouldn't be that.
Here's the relevant config:
  <devExpress>
    <themes enableThemesAssembly="true" styleSheetTheme="" theme="Moderno" customThemeAssemblies="" font="12px 'ClientsOwnFont'" />
    <compression enableHtmlCompression="false" enableCallbackCompression="true" enableResourceCompression="true" enableResourceMerging="true" />
    <settings accessibilityCompliant="false" doctypeMode="Html5" rightToLeft="false" embedRequiredClientLibraries="true" checkReferencesToExternalScripts="false" ieCompatibilityVersion="edge" />
    <errors callbackErrorRedirectUrl="" />
    <resources>
      <add type="ThirdParty" />
      <add type="DevExtreme" />
    </resources>
  </devExpress>
And here's the settings on the page:
@Html.DevExpress().WebDocumentViewer(
settings =>
{
    settings.Name = "WebDocumentViewer";
    //settings.Report = Model.Report;
    //settings.CallbackRouteValues = new { Controller = "VisitReport", Action = "ClientVisitReportPartial", id = Model.VisitReportId };
    //settings.ExportRouteValues = new { Controller = "VisitReport", Action = "ClientVisitReportExportTo", id = Model.VisitReportId };
    //settings.ClientSideEvents.BeginCallback = string.Format("function (s, e) {{ e.customArgs['id'] = '{0}'; e.customArgs['refresh'] = jQuery('#documentRefresh').val(); }}", Model.VisitReportId);
    //settings.ClientSideEvents.EndCallback = "function(s,e) {{jQuery('#documentRefresh').val('false');}}";
    //settings.SettingsSplitter.ParametersPanelCollapsed = false;
    //settings.SettingsSplitter.SidePaneVisible = false;
    //settings.SettingsReportViewer.UseIFrame = false;
    //settings.StylesReportViewer.ShowDocumentShadow = true;
    //settings.PreRender = (sender, e) =>
    //{
    //    //// Ugly code to remove some of the standard output options...
    //    var dv = sender as MVCxDocumentViewer;
    //    var tb = (ReportToolbarComboBox)dv.ToolbarItems[16];
    //    tb.Elements.RemoveAt(8);
    //    tb.Elements.RemoveAt(6);
    //    tb.Elements.RemoveAt(4);
    //    tb.Elements.RemoveAt(3);        
    //    dv.ToolbarItems.RemoveAt(15);
    //    dv.ToolbarItems.Add(tb);
    //};
}).Bind(Model.Report).GetHtml()
The commented out lines were  used for our DocumentViewer settings.
I will add that if the page zoom is on Page Width then it looks fine at 100%, is there a way to change that on rendering?
Ideally the text will change size on page zoom, would this end up being a CSS pixel width job (the reports contain several font sizes so this may prove difficult)
This contains comercially sensitive data so i cannot provide screenshots unfortunately.

Hello DevExpress Team,
I?m using TcxVirtualVerticalGrid as property editor in our project. For TcxCheckbox Editor rows I use a TcxBitmap graphic to show the Checkstates. It works fine, but the complete cell area can be clicked to change the Checkstate. I want, that the checkstate only changes when click on my bitmap. 
I cannot find any sample or hint in documentation. See attached a screenshot to explain.

In our current software, when we save, we get new Ids for all of the objects being saved. We update the DB  and the working memory with these, but the ActiveFilter does not get updated and is still looking for the old id after the save and thereby does not display the column to be filtered. There are many properties within the ActiveFilter that contain the old field name (ie - ActiveFilterCriteria, ActiveFilterString, FilterPanelText, etc). Is there a way, once we have the new Id, to simply make one statement that would update all of the properties to reflect?

The user is select a row in LISTVIEW. 
Is there an event I could trap using a view controller to get the record selected?

Hi,
the dxTreeView ignores the style property max-height. If property max-height is set for its container no scrollbar is shown and the treeview "takes as much height as it needs" and no scrollbar is shown. Only if property height is set for the container its height is limited and a scrollbar will be shown.
 

Hi,
I am trying to create class from where I can show notification messages.
Placed a custom template in the file App.xaml
And created a class 
All code are from examples from your website.
If I run the code I get the message "Value cannot be null. Parameter name : dependencyObject"
Have the feeling that I need to set the template to make it all work but can't find the correct example to show me how to do it.
Can you please tell me if it is even possible and if so help me with example code that shows me how to create a custom notificatie with a custom template in C#.
Thanks in advance.

Hi,
We are using DevExpress GridControl for one of our Application.
On the control the application user applies filter & grouping.
The data binded to the control undergoes background Updates which is very well shown to the user.
We are seeing following issues with the Updates
1. With Filter : -
Suppose there is a Column Name "IsAuthorized" which can have values "Y" or "N". 
User has applied the filter to see only the rows where "IsAuthorized" = "Y".
Suppose with background Data Updates one of the row changes its IsAuthorized from "Y" to "N"
The issue is User still sees the Updated Record with "IsAuthorized" = "N",  Instead of the row getting filtered out
2. With Grouping
In the above example, instead of filtering, Suppose User has grouped the Data on Column "IsAuthorized"
There are two groups now. One with "IsAuthorized" = "Y".& other as "IsAuthorized" = "N".
Suppose with background data updates one of the row changes from "IsAuthorized" = "Y" to "IsAuthorized" = "N".
We see the updated value but the issue is the record still shows in the group with  "IsAuthorized" = "Y" instead of moving to group with  "IsAuthorized" = "N".
Kindly help..
Best Regards

Hi,
Previously we had a dashboard connected to SQL server using stored procedure with parameters passed to procedure . Now we are moving to OLAP cube for the same dashboard. I have some questions
 1)  we have 4 dashboard items; 2 bar charts and 2 grids. 1 chart and 2 grids are loading based on the bar, the user clicks from the first barchart. For this  we have kept a hidden reportid. We kept an invisible parameter through which we were passing the reportid for last 3 item's stored proc using the clientside item click.
is there any way we can add reportid also along with the value ?
2) is there any way we can set hidden parameters and pass the reportid w hen the user clicks on the bar to the cube to filter the data.
3) is there any way to filter the cube data based on another 4 par ameters? I was doing this previously by keeping invisible parameters and setting it's value through the dashboard loaded event.
4) will the master filtering work for the cube in the same way it works for normal dashboard?
Thank you

Hi,
 I would like to use the ChartControl SaveToFile / LoadFromFile feature, but every time I try to load the chart layout the following message is displayed :
 
Please use the attached sample to reproduce the problem. 
Steps to reproduce :
- Run the application
- Chose Open  ribbon button and select the 'DashboardChartSample.xml' file
A chart with data is displayed
- Clic the 'Restore Chart Layout' button located to the right of the ribbon
- Select the 'chart_172011_1.xml' and clic Open
The 'cannot be rendered' message is displayed
You can try to export and load your own layout file using the 'Save Chart Layout'.
How can I fix the problem ?
Thanks

hello,
I have 2 questions. the results i  found so far are very old or not getting the point. perhaps now 2018 the controls got new features.
1.
My navigtion on our Intranet website is already big. I use ASPxNavBar , is there any search ability implemented ? As a search panel in the  ASPxGridView for e.g. 
2. As i need a multilanguage platform i need a translation of all my navigation nodes, in the moment i use GetLocalResourceObject with App_LocalResources. Is there any smart feature of ASPxNavBar siwtching the xml files to other languages ?
thx

I downloaded the tools for importing Access reports, but the tools are in C+/C# and my app is in VB. I received errors trying to use the calls to the C code because it was not VB. Is there a way to have both VB and C routines in the same app and play together nicely? Are there any workarounds you can recommend? I have scores of reports to import and doing them manually is very hard as they are medical forms with lots of fields in freeform layout.
thanks 

Hi, I have a requirement to open the EditForm in the gridview using "CTL and +" and then collapse or dispose the editform using "CTL and -" keys.  Can you pls guide me on this as I am at a loss trying with different key events.

I have 3 Gridviews on a page.  Based on the row selected in the first I want to display data in the sub grids based on an ID from the first grid.  I am using the FocusedRowChanged event.  And I am updating a Session variable.  I then told the Data sources to rebind, when they do they aren't using the new session variable so the other grids don't update correctly.  Seems to be something simple I am missing

I am using Master grid in my application and showing total summary in detail grid .
Issue is when I am changing Detail grid then total summary works fine.
Unfortunately it's break when I am changing value of master grid then Detail grid value will be change but total summary not working fine.
please review the attached screen cast for better explanation.

I'm using postgres sql as my datasource.
I have configured the dashboard(s) to use a ConnectionString defined in App.Config.
I modify the connection string for different environments (eg development, testing, stage) and the correct string is picked up by the dashboards.
However.
Postgres requires you to specify tablenames and/or queries using the catalog prefix:
eg prefix1.mytablename
These prefixes change between the different environments I am using.
Is there any way I can overwrite the specified TableName / SQL for a query  before the dashboard connects to the database for data?
I have tried with ConfigureDataSource (but I don't get access to the queries) and DataLoading (doesn't fire for SQL data sources)
eg I want to change this (which is saved in the dashboard file)
<Query Type="SelectQuery" Name="MyQueryName">
        <Tables>
          <Table Name="
.mytablename" />
        </Tables>
        <Columns>
          <AllColumns Table="
.mytablename" />
        </Columns>
      </Query>
to the equivalent of this, but in code, at dashboard loading time
<Query Type="SelectQuery" Name="MyQueryName">
        <Tables>
          <Table Name="
.mytablename" />
        </Tables>
        <Columns>
          <AllColumns Table="
.mytablename" />
        </Columns>
      </Query>
I also need the user to be able to switch between diff erent dashboards using the viewer and have the correct prefix applied each time, not just for the first default dashboard!

Hello,
I'm trying to configure the bootstrap cardview and have a two questions involving formatting (see attached screencapture):
1. I cannot seem to control the number of cards per page even though I set the "SettingsPager > ItemsPerPage = 1". Its okay until the page approaches full size as on a PC. In this instance I always only have one card but the card item seems to compress to allow more items which causes the formatting issue.
Thank,

Hy there.
I made a report with a pivot grid. The problem is i cannot get the look that i need.
The main problem is in finding a way to merge text cell that should be places in the columns.
I have attached a archive containing a xls file with the data i get from my stored procedure, and a picture with how the report should look.
Can you tell me if its possible to have the header the way its in the picture.
And one more thing . You will see in the pictures and the data that i have multiple years. I would need that if i go to another the page to have the first two columns show as well (the 2 columns under "Category Type").
 

Hi,
Is there a way to make the Root Item look exactly like the Sub Item (the arrows should be the smaller one and no line after the Root Item) without re-templating the whole control?

I am designing DevExpress XtraReports to replace currently existing reports, but will continue to use the data that is generated in our current process. To do this, I'm creating Excel spreadsheets with sample data that looks exactly like the real data and binding my XtraReports to the Excel data at design time. At runtime, I switch to the real data by assigning the report.DataSource. This works great when there is only one spreadsheet/data table. I'm not sure how to assign the tables to the report when there are multiples.
For example, at design time I have the following Excel DataSources:  excelDataSource1, excelDataSource2, excelDataSource3
At runtime, I have a DataSet with 3 tables. I want the first table in the DataSet to be used in place of excelDataSource1, the second table to be used in place of excelDataSource2, etc.
When there is just one sheet and DataTable, all I have to do is make the assignment: report.DataSource = DataSetReport1, where DataSetReport1 is the name of the runtime DataSet. What else must I do in the case of multiple tables?
Thank you for your help!
 

We have a product that was started well before we began using DevExpress. It is a standard .NET WinForms application. Therefore, a lot of the older dialogs and other windows use the regular System WinForms.
After we began using DevExpress, quite a number of new dialogs/windows have been added using the DevExpress XtraForm type.
With DevExpress 16.1.7 (our "current" version), both the System WinForms windows and the XtraForm windows have the same look. (The title bars will take on the appearance from the OS.)
I tried updating to 17.2.5, and with that all the XtraForm windows have the Default "DevExpress Style" look to them, which differentiates them from the rest of the application. I've tried numerous ways to force them back to using the OS appearance, but I have not been successful. (Other than assigning them some "skin" that looks like the OS. But, of course, I'm on Windows 10, many of our clients will be on Windows 7, 8, OR 10. So again, we'd have inconsistencies.) 
We did not use DevExpress for skins, so this has created a bit of a problem if we decide to carry through with the upgrade.
So, is there a way to NOT have XtraForm windows use "skins" with 17.2.5?
Thanks,

I'm displaying group footer summary values as displayed in the attached screen shot.
I want to use a click event to detect if a footer is clicked, and then extract the footer dimensions and values .. (in this case there are 2 dimensions).
The dimensions and values are required as parameters for a further query to an underlying database.
The 2 dimension/value pairs are circled, plus the value clicked (
I can trap the click event fine.. but I get an invalid row handle when interrogating the event object and grid view.. using the following code :- 
Clearly, my approach is off.
How can I get the summary dimensions and values returned based on the click event ?

Hello,
I'm using the XtraGrid in combination with some custom UserControls. These UserControls depend on the status of the XtraGrid's AutoFilterRow which in my case can be one of the following:
1) "column filter value transmitted" (when I entered a filter value in the AutoFilterRow of a specific column and pressed enter), 
2) "column filter value removed" (when I removed the filter value in the editor of the AutoFilterRow of a specific column and pressed enter) or 
3) "all filter values removed" (when I hide the AutoFilterRow)
Unfortunately, DevExpress does not provide me with events that can 
be adapted to 
.
But since DevExpress' grid is great, it can be modified in various ways. I managed to customize the grid in order to be able to fire the custom events by doing the following:
1) Overriding 
, firing the event for 1), and keeping track of the given filter settings.
3) Defining a custom event handler for 
and doing the following:
2) Defining a custom event handler for 
and doing the following:
The custom events fire as expected, everything is working fine.
I'm still not really satisfied with my implementation, though.
Do you have any suggestions how I could achieve the custom events in a nicer way?


Hi,
I am building an application to publish a large number of a variety of reports. We have just migrated to a new banking system and we have around 250 reports that are being created as stored procedures from a data warehouse. The application should be able to deliver the record sets from the called sp to any user in a grid view, enabling them to manipulate the data and eventually download the result as Excel file.
To achieve this I used a ASPX grid view with the property 'Auto generate columns' not defining any columns which is hidden in an ASPX Popup control. The user may or may not have to provide parameters to execute the stored procedure called referenced in the SQL data source for the grid view control. the stored procedure will return different report outputs depending on the parameter 'SPROC' which is linked to the report title in the list box. So far the application works as expected - a user can select a report and the grid view provides the requested data, however there are two issues with the nature of the SQL data source in this application:
* after entering the parameters on the last post-back the user will have to wait some time for the parameters to upload and the data set to download. I can see the activity on Chrome at the bottom left (Uploading / Waiting) after the page has reloaded I can click 'Open report' to reveal the popup and data will appear in the grid view, if I don't wait until this process is finished the popup will already open but the grid view will be empty. How can I time the popup to wait for the process to finish? Can I insert a progress bar to indicate that a data load process is running and the user has to wait? Ideally I would like to have a progress bar showing right after click 'Open report'. I understand that the event  <ClientSideEvents Click="function (s,e) {GridPopup.Show();}" /> happens on the client side - how can I time the open event based on the successful completion of the load of the record set into the SQL data source?
Thanks,
Kai

I discovered this while attempting to follow this documentation:

I want to add an icon image to the tokens in my TokenBox, see attached picture for an example. I see there is the ItemImage-Url property which adds an image to the items in the dropdown list but I want to add an image to the token after the item has been selected. I was able to accomplish this by using this markup:
Notice that I was not able to set the left border width directly, I needed to set the general border width and then shrink all but the left to get it to work; I think this is a bug. Also, it would be nice if there was a more direct way to accomplish this such as adding TokenImage properties.
Thank you. 

Hello,
With the ASPxRichEdit I have a concern with what it does on the server side. T19808 states:
This is expected behavior. When a document is opened in this ASPxRichEdit, a special session value stores its state on the server. When you modify the document, these changes are stored in this session and displayed in the control all the time the document remains open.
From what I have read, I am making the assumption the "special session" has a scope to the user's session and not something two or more users will collide on.
My concern is when the user navigates to another page, the special session remains in tact on the server and could affect scalability. I have a case where the rich edit is in a popup and when the popup closes I can issue a DocumentManager.CloseDocument(ID) in a callback to remove it. In another case the document stays open on a page in read only mode and the user can navigate to a different page. I don't think there is anything we can do if the browser locks up or closes unexpectedly other than wait out the session timeout value.
I realize this is a secondary question but may be related. What is a best practice for the document ID (Session.SessionID, UserID, "StaticValue" ). I am working with documents stored in a VarBinary on SQL server (could use the primary key of the record).
Please advise on this.
Thanks,
Mike  

Hi,
We are working on multiple websites for related desktop applications, one is already built with DevExpress MVC 5 and other is being built with DevExtreme and Angular 5. We used the in-built theme Youthful and has built the menubar for the existing website. We need to duplicate the same look and feel for DevExtreme website too, but we found the Youthful theme missing from here.
Is there any way to use those themes in DevExtreme. Or can I build something similar through theme builder.
Also note that both of these applications are desktop applications, so would want the widgets to render correctly on the UI.
Can you please guide me. Attaching screenshots of the UI which I want to mimic.

Current documentation and experimentation indicates that the data source must be an array of objects, where each value is a property in the object. When transferring LARGE amounts of data from the server to the client it is far more efficient to use an array of array of values (i.e. a matrix) to reduce the amount of data transferred and stored in the browser. Because of this, "jqGrid" supports either an array of objects or an array of array of values as a data source.
Can the data grid support an array of array of values? 
At the moment I am force to convert my array of array of values to an array of objects for display purposes.
Thanks. 

In the legacy scheduler, the AppointmentDrop event had two arguments, EditedAppointment and SourceAppointment.
I used this to compare the start and end times to make sure only the resource changed during a drag/drop operation and not the time:
In the AppointmentDrop event args, there is a collection of ViewModels, but it is unclear how I can achieve the same comparison to determine if the operation should be allowed or not.

After upgrading to 17.2.5 I get the following error when the application tries to initialize. How do I fix this?
It should be referencing 17.2.5 how do I update this information in the build?
System.IO.FileLoadException: 'Could not load file or assembly 'DevExpress.Persistent.BaseImpl.v17.2, Version=17.2.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b88d1754d700e49a' or one of its dependencies.

Hi Dev-Express-Team,
I want to create my own propertygrid with two main additional features:
1) making property fields visible depending on values on other fields
2) replacing default editors with my own editors, which get nice additional functions because my classes which where shown in the propertygrid get attributes which control the functions of the editors
My Solutions:
For point 1) 
I use the CustomPropertyDescriptors Event. It allows me to dynamically hide properties of my object. It works fine. But I recognice the when i assign a simple object whith only one property, then the event is thrown TWO times. I would expect that this happend only one time. When you have complex objects then the event fires very often -  I think this is not necessary - may be there is a bug????
For point 2)
I don't register my editors for a type. Instead of this I use the datasourcechanged event. When the event is thrown I travers threw all rows in the propertygrid analyze the property-descriptors and assign my default (static) editors or my custom tweaked editors to the rows.
But there are problems with this way. All rows must be expanded before my assignment process. When I do not expand all rows then rows which where expand later do not get my editors. So is there an "expand" event or an event when rows where added to the grid?????
Another problem is that my assignment gets lost when the grid get an update because of changed values.
I already used an approach with the custom recordcelledit-event. But when working which this event I can see that this event is fired very very often and the process of creating and tweaking me editors takes some time - so i want to avoid using this event.
Is there a chance to get it work without customrecordcelledit - or is this the correct that i should use?

Hello,
We use WinForms Grid control with DataSource set. 
DataSet values are doubles, but they should be displayed in a special custom format. 
To achieve it we use CustomColumnDisplayText event.
CustomColumnDisplayText(object sender, DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.CustomColumnDisplayTextEventArgs e) 
{
   e.DisplayText = SOMETHING;
}
That works fine but not for edit mode.
In edit mode, editor displays not formatted value. 
To fix it, we use ShownEditor event and set ActiveEditor Text property explicitly: 
GridView_ShownEditor(object sender, EventArgs e) {
   var ae = MyGridView.ActiveEditor as DevExpress.XtraEditors.TextEdit;
   ae.Text = MyGridView.GetFocusedDisplayText(); 
}
That also works. 
However, there is a problem. ShownEditor event raises at the moment when ActiveEditor already placed something (standard double.ToString in our case representation) in the cell. It leads to double drawing and flickering. 
Is it possible to avoid double drawing? 
How can we make ActiveEditor to set Text to proper (formatted) value initially or at least before cell drawing started? 
Thank you,

Dear Sir/Madam:
Hi,I just bought the product “DevExpressVCLProducts-17.2.4”from your company,and it was really slow to use it to read and write data. 
It takes fifty seconds to read and write 8500 datas with your product,
while it only needs 5 seconds to use “F1Book6”to do this.Usually,we need to deal with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands data.
I do not think it can process anymore in this case.Plase help me to solve this problem?
 
The computer language i use?

Hello Support, 
Background:
ASP. Net  Web application 
DevExpress ASP. Net 14. 2.7
I have a web application, where I use XtraReport to generate PDF report.  (Pic Attached).  I am using the XtraReportToolbar for "Save to Disk" function.  My question is there a way to display  "Loading"  or some other message like "please wait..processing" as soon the Save to disk icon is clicked. The report file take about 40 secs to generate.  All the other menu icons produce the "Loading" notification except save to disk.  It is difficult for the user to know if they have clicked the icon and if there is any processing going on.  Our customer wants to have some message in there.  
Is it possible to show some notification?

I have columns where the data type in a given column is different per cell, e.g some cells are text, other numbers and others booleans.
I know I can write my own cell template and provide the template in the columns cellTemplate callback. But is it possible to use the existing templates, e.g for the checkbox. If so, how can this be done.
Note, simply setting the data type doesn't switch the template for the cell, e.g. sometimes I get the text 'true/false/ instead of the checkbox, other times I get a checkbox when the data is an empty string.
 

Hello DevExpress,
Is there any chance there are any additional articles or resources out there on using the KPI module besides this 
I've been trying to get my head wrapped around it.
I am under the impression that if we set the 
  to a value of week we would get a KPI measuring current week to previous week as well as get a spark line of the measure as a function of time. But it seems i am unable to get this field is to do anything. 
The only way i can get results is to use  Range, compare box, and Range to Compare. I would like to get something on the order of take the last 7 days sum and compare it to the 7 previous days before that. To get something on the order of this I would need to be able to define custom Rage parameters. Can you create custom ranges within the Range and Compare To Range fields.
 Also the Range and compare to Range fields seem to have an option for "Rolling" as depicted in the Concepts/Extra-Modules/KPI documentation. there appears to not be that option when I try.
There is something that is not clicking and hope you could point me to some additional resources on how to correctly use the KPI module.

Greetings.
I need to see the possibility of positioning the grand totals of the pivot on top of this, or be able to immobilize them.

This is a bit of a high-level question, but we've been using an app that was built around the MVVM Scaffolding framework for doing a lot of CRUD work against a database with several different related Entities.
We're spending the next month looking at what statistics we can expose to our end-users and I've been looking at the Dashboard tools in the demo center and things seem set up really well to be able to create Views in the database that expose the data points we care about and then diagram those views with the different dashboard controls and use the Range Filter to get real-time changes to those charts. I then also noticed the WPF subscription has access to DXCharts, a Range Control, and other similar controls to recreate most of what the Dashboard seems to provide. I am wondering how or if these WPF controls are different than the Dashboard controls?
A couple use cases for us would be:
1. A Location Entity in our database has several Requests and Referrals, both of which are created by Users. If I open the LocationView, I'd want the user to be able to explore data about how many Requests and Referrals have been made to/from that location over time, by type, by User, etc.
2. A User in our database can create Requests and Referrals. It would be useful to have a place where a User could explore data about Requests and Referrals they have created over time.
We currently have the DXperience subscription and are evaluating if the Dashboard features would be worth upgrading. Also if there are any samples available where these types of controls are integrated into an MVVM Scaffolding application that would be useful.
Thanks.
 

I have a dxSelectBox that uses the display text as its value. It must accept custom values that are entered. When a custom value is entered, an ajax call back to the server is fired to enter the value into a separate table, and return the new item. If it the ajax fails, it won't be entered into the table but I still need the custom value to be added to the dxSelectBox options and selected.
Here is a snippet from the method called by the OnCustomItemCreat ing event for the dxSelectBox:
Both the .done and .fail functions push a new item into the options, and reload the items for the SelectBox. However only the .done() function selects the item afterwards. If the callback fails, the new item is added to the options but isn't selected. The SelectBox is left with no value selected, however the newly added value can be selected afterwards from the options, but its another step.
What I need is for the custom item to be added and selected as the value, regardless of the result from the Ajax call. The "Name" property of the item is used as both the DisplayExpr and ValueExpr of the SelectBox.

I have a gridview that I have 2 columns with numeric values that i want to merge into 1 column and add a hyperlink to one of the values within that merged column.

In the remarks for the CustomAllowAppointmentConflicts event, the following note appears:
  "The common practice is to clear the 
 collection at the  beginning, and populate it with any appointment if the user's action  should be canceled.  You can even create a fake appointment for this  purpose and add it to the collection."
This is exactly how I'm implementing the feature right now.  It works well.  But I don't see an obvious way to inform the user of *which* appointment(s) is/are actually causing the conflict.  This is frustrating my users as they're being told there's a conflict, but they're having trouble finding it.
Is there an example or best practice for how to show the conflicting appointments identified in the CustomAllowAppointmentConflicts event?

From version 17.2 we are having problems with the application. When the application is closed, the exe is not released from de memory. This did not happen with version 17.1.x. I am attaching a very simple example.

I'm creating a WebChartControl with a GanttDiagram. I'm using Annotations to Identify Key points. I need the ability to create a line (shown in a green dashed line in the attachment).
Is it possible to create a line between two Annotations?

Hello there,
I need to be able to create this navigational structure from the code behind page.  I am recreating this navigation to be database driven, and have been able to accomplish most everything except being able to place a new group inside an specific item template.  I have shortened the navigational control to just contain the structure I need to reproduce here.



Hello,
I am using a Web Control Chart to display my Pivot Grid data.
Data is # of images every 30 minutes graphed in a Line view type.
When displayed on the Web Chart Control, the x-axis is only shown hourly, which causes the half hour data point to not be spaced correctly.  
Need to display x-axis as a to a DateTime scale type with measuring units of minutes so the graph can be displayed correctly.
I have tried to set the set the diagram parameters programmatically, like so 
but when I debug the program I get an "
error. 
How do I get the my Web Chart to display the information from its PivotGrid Datasource correctly?
Example: at 9:00 there are 6 images and at 9:30 there are 3. Attached file shows you what the chart looks like

If I create an MDI application with a parent RibbonForm and DocumentManager, and then add a child form with a RichEditControl to the parent form (DocumentManager's 
 is false), the child form has border padding that I do not want.  However, if I add a RichEditControl to a form, generate the ribbon, and then convert to a RibbonWindow, it does not have this padding.  Is there a way to remove the padding in the MDI case?  Attached are screenshots of what I want and what I don't want.

Hi.  I have a simple map connected to OpenStreetMapDataProvider and a layer that shows a single callout.
The map is in an XtraUserControl.
This control is the content of a TabbedView document. 
My program no longer exits.  I tried adding a MyUserControl.Dispose on shutdown and it hangs there.
Is there some proper unloading I need to do with maps?
Thanks. 

I just upgraded 17.1.6 to 17.2.5 and rebuild the project and this message showed up.
 // Controller

I could not find the DownloadFiles(settings, rootFolder)  function in given documents. How can I use it? 

Hi,
Hi,
I have a  WPF user control which simply put has this structure:
We use this view to show data in lots of different reports, based on the selected filter options.
Now I have a request for one report not to show it, but to just export data to csv.. Since I would like to reuse the following structure, I wonder if its possible to set DocumentPreviewControl's Source property to a text message like:
Successfully exported xxxx records to file.csv
I know I can use an empty report and place a message in center of it, but it would be less overkill if I can display just a message (like in DocumentPreview itself, or setting a UserControl as DocumentSource, or whatever).
This would also be useful to show some kind of initial message on empty document preview, like "press button to calculate data and show report".
Thanks,
Goran

HI.
I need to add extra columns to an existing ASPxTreelist  at runtime.  I use the code below.
 Private Sub buildASPxTreeList(ByVal pl As Model.Reports.Report)
        ASPxTreeList1.Caption = pl.ReportTitles(0).ToString + vbNewLine + pl.ReportTitles(1).ToString + vbNewLine + pl.ReportTitles(2).ToString
        For i = 1 To pl.Rows.Item(0).Cells.Count - 1
            If i = 1 Then
                ASPxTreeList1.Columns.Item(3).Caption = pl.Rows(0).Cells(i).Value
            Else
                Dim col As New TreeListTextColumn
                col.Caption = pl.Rows(0).Cells(i).Value
                ASPxTreeList1.Columns.TreeList.Columns.Insert(ASPxTreeList1.Columns.Count, col)
            End If
        Next
    End Sub
My ASPxTreeList is setup as per below.
<dx:ASPxTreeList ID="ASPxTreeList1" runat="server" ClientInstanceName="treeList" AutoGenerateColumns="False"
     KeyFieldName="Id" ParentFieldName="ParentId" Width="75%" > <%--these properties--%>

       <Images>
           <ExpandedButton Width="0px">
           </ExpandedButton>
       </Images>

The issue I have is the frist column added is always in the incorrect place ( First Column), all the rest of the new columns are placed correctly (Last Column) as per atttachment.
What am I doing wrong?

Hello! 
I have a problem when in the popup the first item is disabled the focus is non-existent, how can I add it so that for example FirstName when opening the popup has the focus?
I left an example:
 
 
 Thank you!

1) Run the attached project w/ 17.1.8
2) Invoke the popup editor on the single cell
3) Note that the popup remains active and properly displays the messagebox
Now upgrade the project to 17.2.5 and try the same scenario.
Note that the popup closes as soon as the MessageBox is invoked.
The hotfix for T600459 does not address this.

Hi guys,
I have searched around for the answer but I haven't been successful. I am trying to change the field list layout to fields section and area side-by-side in code at run time.
I also need to adjust the width and/or height of the hidden area.
Can you help?
Many thanks,

If a user has a cell with a formula that results in a TRUE value or a FALSE value then copying and pasting that cell will result in an error on Excel. The error is a  "Problem During Load" with the Table.
To reproduce the problem do the following:
1. Open the VCL demo application
2. Enter "=TRUE" into a cell without the inverted commas.
3. Copy the cell
4. Paste the cell into Excel
The problem is happening because in TdxSpreadSheetXMLSSWriter.WriteCellData, there is no condition to handle boolean values so they get written as "True" or "False". Excel expects a 1 or 0 here for the value of the cell.

Hi there,
I am having a problem with two list boxes.
The first is a list of campuses, and when you select a campus from the first list, it populates a second listbox with a list of rooms at that campus.  This part works fine and everything gets populated ok.
The problem is that when I click a button to retrieve the room details, it returns a null reference exception for the lstRooms list box, but the lstCampus listbox returns the Campus I selected.
The code it below:
The javascript is 
And the code behind for the cbCampusChanged Callback is
The code behind to retrieve the values from the list box is
The lstRooms.SelectedItem.Text causes the exception, but the lstCampus.SelectedItem.Text works without a problem.  The only thing I can think of that is different is that I perform a callback after the Campus has changed and I don't do that after the room is selected, but I am not sure how I do that.
Anyway, I hope that is clear enough.  Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.
thanks,
Darren

Hi, We are using XRPivotGrid in a Detail Group of a report. The report has different datasource (TopSupplier), and the pivot grid has different datasource (Customers_Pivot).
The pivot grid show multiple times based on the grouping (which is ok) , but it should be filtered based on the group field (=CustomerID). So we are using the following code:
 
As you can see, the GetCurrentColumnValue method doesn't get field values from the pivot grid data source (Customers_Pivot) . It gets column values from the data source that is used for the Report data member (TopSupplier).
Our problem is, for each group, we need customer ID value for that group, and filter the pivot grid datasource by that customer ID value. But we can't get value for any field from pivot grid data source (Customers_Pivot) in the before print method. 
We have attached the solution that reproduces the problem

Hi,
We are looking for a way for dxPivotGrid to scroll horizontally (when needed) instead of increasing the size of its parent container  in our Angular project. We've tried the following:
- adding overflow: auto to the parent container
 - solution detailed in 
- different settings for scrolling.useNative
Instead of adding a horizontal scroll bar to the pivot grid, we get a horizontal scroll bar on the browser window in our application. Is there a workaround to this?
Thanks

I added a ContextMenu to a form in order to be able to display some options on a button (simplebutton). The button has a setting for Look&Feel, and I set that to DefaultLook&Feel. But the ContextMenu, which I attached to the button, doesn't have a Look&Feel property (that I could find) and therefore doesn't provide the proper colors for the ContextMenu.

Hi Team,
I am using an AspxGridview in batch Edit Mode. Here the functionality is that the end user navigates over the cell that he wants to edit using arrow keys , hits enter and then starts editing the value. What is required is, he navigates over the cell that he wants to edit using arrow keys and straight away starts editing without hitting the enter button.
So basically can the cell start its editing on any Keypress instead of the Enter.??  if yes could you please provide me with a sample code for it...
Regards.

Hi,
All my customer facing the gridview performance degrade badly compare to using version 16.1.8
There's no changes in source but just update the component version.
Basically the operation is like this, every row input in grid, it will recalculate it's binded datatable (converted to dataview)  for every row again to get the correct result.
The performance degrade of adding each row in gridview was significant after 10 rows being added.

Hi,
I have a few problems with the new search feature of aspxtreelist. 
First, If all nodes are collapsed and filter is applied, treelist only shows the most outer parent node of the search  result and child nodes are removed from the tree. The results can not be seen. However I want the treelist to expand to the show the search results. Search feature only works effectively if "AutoExpandAllNodes" is set to true which is not suitable for cases when tree has lots of elements.
Second, If I use client side export feature then search panel becomes disfunctional. I need to refresh the page in order to be able to use search panel again.
Is there any solution/workaround to these problems. 

Hi,
I'm trying to create a custom BarStaticItem-class. I tried to follow the example shown in ticket 
Attached you find the modified example project. Basically, I copied the MyBarButton code and changed the names to "BarStaticTimerItem[...]". My Problem is, that the MyBarButton-item shows up in the context menu of the ExtendedBarManager's add command, but my newly added BarStaticTimerItem does not.
Could you kindly check the code an tell me, where the problem is?

Dear support,
Is there any way to tell devextreme not to load your font icons file and replace the icons with font awesome ones?
Now with font-awesome 5, it possible not to load font files, which is great, but unfortunately,  some of your control depend on your icons, for example, the checkbox and accordino. Given that most of your controls already support font-awesome, it would be great, if there was a possibility just to say to devextreme to directly link your icons to font-awesome icons, like a global property when initializing or something similar. It would be really easy from your side to create a a mapping of your existing icons to the font-awesome ones.

Hi,
I have a WPF TreeListControl. I want to have a gap between the columns. I'm able to achieve this at the header level using the ContentTemplate as shown below:

Hello,
     
in the example below you see a dxPivotGrid coupled with a dxChart. Each dxPivotGrid data field uses a different formatting for the displayed values.
In my real app these formatting definitions are not static but derived from some complex conditions. 
The coupled dxChart is to show the value details in its tooltips. How can I achieve that the values in the tooltips of dxChart use the same formattings
as the belonging data columns in the pivot grid. The tooltip property allows just a common format definition for all tooltips but not an individual definition
dependent on the bound data column of the pivot grid.
Best regards 
Matthias


OK, I see. What would be best practice for this? use the deployment wizard to get all related libraries and update the config file, deploy to production/test and then remove all libraries from development again and re-deploy on the next run? 

I'm working the first time with BackstageViewControl, so this is maybe an issue because I don't know it better..
I added a RibbonControl to my Form and converted the Form to an RibbonForm.
Then I added a BackstageView via the RibbonControls Action-menu to the Form
Then I add a BackstageViewTabItem to the BackstageView
Now I drag a RecentItemControl into the "tabpage"-area of BackStageViewTabItem
Now I add several (1-2) PinItems to the RecentItemControl and finally an SeparatorItem (All done with the Action menu within the RecentItemControl (see pic attached)
Now I'm not able to remove the separator anymore, because I can't select it. 
I can select it with Visual Studios Properties-Panel, but that does not select the element itself.
Usually (e.g. in other controls with child-elements) there is an "Items"-Property somewhere to open a separate window to add/remove those, but I couldn't find this property for the RecentItemControl.
I know I can remove it if I delete it the related code in the designer-file, but is there an easier way? If not, please make this a suggestion for the next update.

Hello.
ASPxUploadControl worked OK when it was just in DIV . But it's event OnFileUploadComplete not  ceased  to fire when I placed thiscontrol into jQuery dialog.

Thanks in advance,

Hello,
I have tried several ways to find a way to modify the tab header of a NavigationPage, but until now I was not able to find a solution. The tab header should have two optional location for an image. As far as I understand the underlying control of the tab header is a button, where you can include an image, but only on the left side of the text.
In WPF it is very easy to achieve this goal, because you can style the header the way how it should look like. Unfortunately WPF is not an option in the project. I have attached an example, how the header should look like, the images in the example are only placeholders.
Could you give me perhaps a hint how I can modify the tab header button?
Best regards

When I try to drag an item (for reordering) there is a chance I drag it over an area where the item can't be placed.
If I let go off the item in this area, the item does not stay in its original place (as expected) but gets deleted entirely from the form.
I don't think this should happen in designer mode since developers could delete items by accident this way and mess up their application without knowing it (if they didn't notice that the item disappeared)
I attached an gif as example.

Hi!
Today I get select rows this way, for "multiple" mode:

I'm using a TreeListControl and im binding the data to it. I have attached the sample project of the same.
I want to achieve two UI customizations
1) I want to add a label on top of the Control so that it covers only 2nd and 3rd columns. 
2) The last header columns length should be bigger than the other column headers.
I have attached the screenshots of the desired output.
Please modify the sample project and help me in achieving this.

I have a Grid View and implementing batch editing.
One column is a bit/bool field called  "Acknowledge" displayed as a checkbox in the grid.

How can I do this? 

Hello,
I need to localize the validation messages of 
 (and maybe others later on).
Specifically I need to localize the message: "The date must be greater than or equal to {0}" as a start.
At the moment I need translations for Danish and Czech but more will follow. The fallback is German.
I found this 
 and this 
 but neither is sufficient for my needs.
The first option lacks of supported languages (just 5 so far) and the latter has no option for AspNetCore.Bootstrap. I also searched in the ASP.Net Platform for "DateEdit" but did not find the localizable string I was searching for and in fact besides two accessibility strings not any other the used search term.
What options do I have to get the needed translations?
Thanks in advance. 

hello I added the report parameter. When I want to view, I just want to choose the date I do not want to choose the time.
how can I do that.
 

Hello,
we are using DataLayoutControl to display our data annotations to generate our form layouts. It works perfect for textfields, combomboxes aso. but the text of the checkbox does not display the datamember it shows up as CheckEdit1, at first i thought its because boolean value, but if i use CheckedComboBoxEdit the issuse don't show up. So its more problem of the version and the CheckBox Method from DevExpress, because a lot of the same problem in the Tickets. If you recommend i can upload an example.
Thanks

Hi,
We're using ASP.NET MVC report designer to create report templates in our web application. The chinese lables do not display correctly when the report is exported into PDF. We've tried using "Arial" font in the report and this hasn't worked. Any suggestions on how to get around this issue?
I have tried the below approaches to try to make the "Arial Unicode MS" font to show up in the Font dropdown inside the designer. But, not successful.
    function reportDesigner_Init(s, e) {
            //Add Font
            s.GetDesignerModel().updateFont({ 'Arial Unicode MS': 'Arial Unicode MS' });
            //Remove Font
            delete DevExpress.JS.Widgets.availableFonts['Arial'];
    }
     function reportDesigner_Init(s, e) {
        DevExpress.Designer.fontInfoFake.filter(function (value) { return value.displayName === "Font Name"; })[0].values["Arial Unicode MS"] = "Arial Unicode MS";
    }

Hi!
We have implemented your XtraRichEdit.v17.2 into our application and have now stumbled upon a weird bug. 
When one of our customers open his OpenOffice document inside the XtraRichEdit, some fonts will change and random letters wil be sett as Uppercase. Even some spaces between characters or words seem to disappear. 
Out of over 2000 customers, it seems weird that only one has reported this issue.  
Is there some way to force the document to retain its contents format? No changes to fonts or other character/paragrahs changes are made to the documents in our implementation. 
Thanks in advance!
-Eirik 


Alexander, 
While testing this sample projet, I found another glitch:
- Select all the items, by opening the dropdown part and checking each item.
- Click 'Ok'
- Then , quickly, click on the 'delete' button of the first token (it will be correctly removed, and the second token will appears as the first one, repeat).  When done quickly enough, it will cause an Exception (sometimes in the TokenEditor, sometimes in the List<T> class...) 
I hope to be clear enough, if not I will record a small video...
It happens more often when launched from Visual Studio, in Debug mode.

Hello Support,
Xaf Web model has some specific model properties which Win does not have. We use the model editor in our Win application with the Web model loaded but can not access the specific properties like AdaptivePriority, how can we accomplish this. Our consultants use the model editor in the application to model both Win and Web models.
Kind regards,

I completely overlooked that on the first issue. It appears to be solved.
On the second however, I've tried 2 different approaches and one variation. The ASPxGridView2.InitNewRow used to work weeks ago but nothing works anymore.

Hi team,
The aspxSpreadsheet control is quite useful to us. Meanwhile we have some thoughts to beautify it or to make it a nicer look. Therefore we have a few questions here. If you can help or provide some suggestions, that will be appreciated!
For all these questions, you can always the your online demo for reference
2. The control has the feature of Excel that scrolling down or scrolling right reach es no boundary. Can we turn off that feature? for example set the right-most column to be column M or set the bottom-most row to be row 100? 
Thank you!
Best,
Jiong

Hello,
we have encountered an issue with the TreeListControl in combination with the AllowRecursiveNodeChecking flag.
What we are currently doing is the following:
1. Load an IList / ObservableCollection  of hierarchical model entries (bound to the ItemsSource of the TreeListControl)
2.  After that update the check states of the model entries recursively
3.  Have AllowRecursiveNodeChecking activated on the TreeListView, so recursively checking and unchecking the leaf items works
The problem with this is that initially the checkboxes are all shown as unchecked except the checked leaf nodes.  I'd expect the control to display the check state of the parent nodes according to it's children 's check states (all checked -> checked, nothing checked -> unchecked, some checked -> indeterminate). Interestingly, this works as expected after resetting the ItemsSource.
What we have tried already:
- Setting  EnableDynamicLoading to false so every node is created initially
- Disabling AllowRecursiveNodeChecking, but that is not an acceptable solution, because our parent nodes cannot have a meaningful check state for themselves
I have attached a small sample project to clarify the issue.
In the project, I have tried to use ObservableCollection and always clear it and add the items, as well as completely resetting the ItemsSource list with raising the property changed event. Both approches  led to the same strange behavior.
The button  simply calls the same data loading procedure that is also called in the constructor. But resetting the ItemsSource by pressing it, resets the UI and shows the correct Indeterminate state on the nodes. You can see the commented code in the ViewModel that shows the alternative (and preferred) approach of using an ObservableCollection.
Is this behavior a bug or am I missing something?
Thanks in advance and best regards. 

Hi,
About SaveCopy, this is a simple example, but i have any other interaction with RihEdit. Yes, in must cases i needed of SaveCopy.
All time i will send information (texts) for richedit after rendering it by ajax.
I realized that after rendering richedit via ajax, all interaction with ajax to the controller functions causes problems if I try to access the document contained in RichEdit.
I think this problem are the calls by ajax, you know, because when rendering the Rich edit usually via cshtml, everything works fine.
Tks for your help and attention.

I have a grid that uses a MemoEdit. I have enabled auto row height and pixel scrolling.
I'm finding that the scrolling will not go to the bottom if the form height is not large enough to show the last row in full.
See images.
Image 1 : Working because last row fits
Image 2: Not working I cannot scroll to bottom because row does not fit
Additional Info: exporting to Excel exports all data correctly

We implemented the Spellchecker in our project.
So far everything works fine but we have the situation that we use some extended Layouts. We use the Layoutcontrol with some EditControls on it and built a TabbedLayoutControlGroup with UserControls. So you have direct Editcontrols mixed with tabs.
SpellChecker.CheckContainer works fine but only for these controls which are visible. That means also onyl for the selected tab in the TabbedLayoutControlGroup.
Is it possible to extend the SpellChecker that with the method CheckContainer I can also check all the tabs with one click?
Thanks

Hello, we are using latest Devexpress Reports on WPF platform (C#).
Before opening report, we send one ItemID to report to filter just one row. And that works.
But, we need to repeat label 6 times, so it would fit on all stickers on A4 page. How can we repeat this?

Hi,
I have a gridview designed at  runtime.
All columns are designed in a certain order.
The user can mask some column via a button, and make them visible again.
Problem is that even if the allowmove property is set to false, when the column get visible again, the initial position  isn't keeped, seems to be visibleindex - 1 every time.
In that void, I just get all gridcolumn that can be invisible, and just make visible = true or false.
Is there anything I forgot ?

Hello Support,
I have been looking into the Mail Merge feature you have and wondered if I can use it to send a mail shot. I understand that you do not provide a mail client but this is fine, I can sort that out. 
My question is , once the mail merge has been created, how do I iterate through the individual entries and take the contents to use as content of an email. I do not want to attach the entry to the email as a file but need the contents. 
Thank you in advance.

Hi,
we have verified an error exporting large datasets in server mode grid.
This is the scenario:
We have a query that extract from a "SQL Server 2012 Standard" 290K records, and the application compiled at 32bits stops working, for memory issue.
We used an  EntityServerModeSource, this is my export code:




I've attached the screenshot of memory situation.
Seems that the ExportToXls method write all record in memory before writing on the excel file.

Hello!
What steps should I do to update my controls to the latest version. Is my licence allows to do this?

Hello sir/madam,
After updating from 15.2 to 17.1, I have a problem with my chart. It seems to be that I cannot click on the points because they are missing. My chart has two modes: interpolation and normal one. I can still cklick on the points and they are shown with normal one bu as soon as I set interpolation  mode (Checkbox in the sample project) the points disappear. This mode uses a  serie which is a custom one implemeted from lineSeries2D.  How can I get them back? 
I have provided in the attachment a sample project  where you can reproduce this behaviour. 
Do not hesitate to contact me if you need further information
Thanks in advance for the support

Dear support,
I am experiencing a problem with dxPopUp : SyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'.
In the project the problem only occurs when there are not partials views loaded on the page with other DevExtreme items. However I haven't been able to reproduce this behavior in a sample project. So far it has cost me 3 days to  reduce the problem to the contenttemplate of the dxPopUp control.
As you can see in the sample project on line 16 of the index.cshtml, I used  a TextBoxBuilder.ToString() method to render the text in the content-template. I do this because in the big project it will also happen like this but in a bit more complex manner.
In the context template  there are 2 buttons to demonstrate that the first button will be rendered, but the second button after the dxTextBox will not be rendered, because of an error in the console: "SyntaxError: expected expression, got '<'".
I think the source of this problem might be in the rendering of the contect-template, because the code looks like:
The "</<% %>script>" look a bit strange to me. These are not rendered by the TextBoxBuilder, because it output looks like:
After discovering this i thought the problem might be with a script tag in the content-template. However if you enable line 17 and put line 16 in comment. You will see that a simple script statement is working without an error, but the rendering is still weird.
line 17:
rendering of the pop-up with line 17 enabled:
But as you can see it is only with the script closing tag.
I also put in line 33, so you are able to see that rendering of DevExtreme controle is working bij using the ToString() method.
As I mentioned before in the real project this problem on occurs not always, most of the time it is working when other DevExtreme controls are rendered outside of the pop-up. However I am not able to reproduce this in the sample project. However reproducing the problem is the most important. 
I looked a number of tickets to see if someone else has this problem as well. I tried different suggestions, but they do not solve this problem.
 With kind regards,
Niek-Jan 
 

Hello ,
I have updated version 17.2.3 to version 17.2.5
Still facing problem with filter criteria. I have to use adddays function in criteria this way .
 AddDays(Property, Days)
but i have typed property so days field should be like this AddDays(Property, TypedProperty.Days)
criteria doesn't accept this way of usage.
you can see error in attached screenshots 

Our entity system has a key property of type object. The type of the key is dynamic (string or decimal) but once determined it is always the same for every entity instance.
When using that key property in the grid we cannot leverage the full extent of your filter and sorting capabilities because the gird does not recognize the exact type of the values . (FieldType is always object). How can we tell the grid that the FieldType is actually a string or number instead of object? 

Hello,

I attach a example rtftext. In this case rtftext property to my ritcheditcontrol contains this example. If I selected range with start=810 and end=810 gettext property return nothing, however if I do this with my aplication using devexpress versi?n 15.2.7, this code returns text last the selection.
How Can I get this range of text?

Dear Support,
I have encountered this issue when upgraded from 17.2.3 to 17.2.5, and a sample project is attached herewith for reference.
In the attached sample project, I have a XrLabel in the report which is bound to a Report Parameter using Expression as follows:-
iif([Parameters].[Parameter1]==0,'Hello 0', 'Hello 1')
When the report is not bound to dataset, the XrLabel can display proper value of "Hello 0" or "Hello 1" with the change of [Parameter1] value. However, once I bind the report datasource to a dataset, the XrLabel binding will not function properly.
This behavior was not happened in 17.2.3.
Appreciate your advise.
Thanks.

I've configure the dataSource in code on dashboard loading .

Is it possible?

Hi,
I am facing the problem that images (configured as UpdateMode=KeepSize and Sizing=ZoomImage) printed inside Snaplist and using SnapImage are incorrectly exported to PDF when  the SnapList is locked.
See attached project.
Click ExportToPdf ribbon item to invoke export to pdf.
There are two lines in the source code:
            LockSnapListAndItsFields(snapControl1.Document, true, true);
            //LockSnapListAndItsFields(snapControl1.Document, false, true);
If the first line is uncommented and the second line is commented (i.e. snaplist is locked) then the PDF is exported incorrectly (see \resources\EXAMPLE_wrong.pdf - proportions are lost, images are stretched)
If the second line is uncommented and the first line is commented (i.e. snaplist is unlocked) then the PDF is exported correctly (see \resources\EXAMPLE_correct.pdf  - exactly the sam as on snap report preview).
Why does it work this way? It looks like a bug , because locking of snaplist does not affect snap report view but it affects PDF.
How can we workaround this problem (fyi: we don't want to change the settings:  UpdateMode=KeepSize and Sizing=ZoomImage as they are crucial for our needs, if changing the setting is not the only possible option)?
Thank you. 

Thanks for your response.
This is not the complete solution as the default User is set to the current user but I didn't getting any other username in the dropdown so that I can use them to filter the grid record.
Here is the screenshot. 

I am using GridControl in server mode to show some sort of events. Each event is represented as a record in the SQL table. New event occurs every few seconds. It works fine.
Some days ago my customer asked me to add export  contents of this grid to Excel.
I was very happy to find GridControl.ExportToXlsx function. I spent only about half an hour to add it to my code, everything worked fine in my laboratory.
But it didn't work at the customer's site. The  output file simply wasn't created. No message at all. Just no output file and no message.
So the first question is: why exceptions are catched and simply ignored?  It is very difficult to find the cause of the error if you don't know what's going wrong.
Then I turned on the first chance exception catching and logging :
06.02.2018 13:44:13 !!! First chance exception:
06.02.2018 13:44:13 System.IO.FileNotFoundException
06.02.2018 13:44:13 Could not load file or assembly 'DevExpress.Mvvm.v15.2, Version=15.2.17.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b88d1754d700e49a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.

Very strange. Visual Studio has included in the setup package all the referenced by my program assemblies, except this one. Ok, I have included it manually. But I can't ever imagine how I have to know that it is to be included? This is the second question.
At last, I have included the Mvvm assembly in the setup package and then I have got the third problem: 
06.02.2018 13:44:41 !!! First chance exception:
06.02.2018 13:44:41 DevExpress.Data.Helpers.InconsistencyDetectedException
06.02.2018 13:44:41 Unexpected number of rows returned: 768021. Expected: 768020
06.02.2018 13:44:41    at DevExpress.Data.Helpers.ServerModeCache.RaiseInconsistencyDetected(String message)
 I supposed that it is happened because the ExportToXlsx code gets numer of records several times during it's execution. But it is the server mode data source and records are adding to the SQL table continuously by another program. I tried to filter these records by date (show only events earlier than February 1st) - and everything worked fine, because there were no new events inside this filter. But without this filter the ExportToXlsx routine permanently fails because new records are continuously adding.
The third question is: what can I do with this situation?  How can I export to Excel my continuously updating data source? This is the most important question.

I am using a DxDataGrid with the popup editor. Inside the editor I need a form with various fields that behave as expected, except for the DxTagBox.
(see attached image) where it behaves as a radio group  without saving its selection once closed.
The first thing I tried is to test the same DxTagBox with the same datasource outside this dx-data-grid / dxo-popup / dxo-form context.  It turned out it is working well.
Here is the code snippet that does not work, I have removed all unecessary fields and columns. 
May be I set the wrong parameters in the editorOptions ?
Thank you

Hi,
This is an extension of a previous ticket I submitted few days ago.
I?n the project attached, each item has its own icons in the second column.
Now, I've added some subitems reaching the 4th level and what I'm trying to achieve is the possibility to show the icon "EYE" to all the subitems of the item which icon has been clicked.
Please, see the pictures attached in the next comment.
Is there a way to do it?
Thank you.

 Hi
I wanted to know how to save MVCxGridView.FilterExpression as a string to the database and be able to restore it to the grid, I have tried saving the bottom text that is displayed as a link but applying it to MVCxGridView.FilterExpression does not work its give an error saying the expression has some syntax error, I think this means that that link text is compatible or is not in the syntax that the MVCxGridView.FilterExpression accepts, I also used CriteriaOperator.Parse().
Thank you

Hello!
I have the following BO's:
- Workgroup
- User
- WorkgroupMembership
WorkgroupMemebrship links User and Workgroup and defines Role of the user in Workgroup. WorkgroupMemebrship has the following properties: Workgroup, User and Role.
I need to implement the following scenario - certain users can have rights to delete WorkgroupMemeberships if Role = 'Member'. These users cant do anything to Workgroup or User and cant edit WorkgroupMemebrship, but must be able to delete it.
When i tried to implement this, i have stumbled on the issue - Delete action is not enabled due to security permissions. It appears that i need to let user to edit Workgroup and User properties to enable user to delete WorkgroupMemebrship object.
Is this by design? Is there any way to only let user delete object without granting him Write permissions?
Thank you!

Dear support,
On the main form that the scheduler control is located, I'm using the events "AppointmentsInserted", "AppointmentsChanged" and "AppointmentsDeleted" to execute the needed CRUD operations on the corresponding business objects. The problem I'm facing is that I cannot fetch the "ReminderInfo" data to store them in the DB. There is no "ReminderInfo" property under the "Appointment" class to get the needed data. I want them as string and not as XML. Basically, I need something similar like the implementation you have for the "RecurrenceInfo" property.
Best regards,
Andreas

I need to add a ToggleButton to DXDocking, I have managed to do most of the work but I have two main issues,
1- All the overridden ControlTemlates are set in App.xaml, and it's applied to the entire application, when adding the new button, and setting  the DockingSplitLayoutPanel HorizontalAlignment to left, It got applied the entire application as well.
How could I specify these two changes only on one docking control while keeping the rest of the application as it is.
2- after adding the button, it hides the shadow of the last tabheader. how to fix this.
I have attached a sample code which demonstrate  these issues. and i'm using the latest version of devExpress. I couldn't upload the entire project because it exceed the maximum size for attached files.
please note:
1- all the templates inside the mainview.xaml are in App.xaml in my application, except the  <Style TargetType="{x:Type ve:TabHeaderControlBoxControl}"> which in the main view.
2- to make it easier for you to see the changes, every specific change for this view only, and not for the entire application. You will fine <!--Edit--> comment above the changed code.
please let me know if you need more information.

Hi there,
I have a navigation pane with several tabpages.
On one of the pages is a treelist.
The treelist is populated by a datatable before the form is being shown.
As long as the treelist has not been visible in the interface = the tabpage with the treelist has not been selected, I cannot set nodes checked and AllNodesCount  = 0.
As soon as the treelist has been displayed, everything is fine, .CheckAll() works and AllNodesCount  too.
Please advise.

I have a ASP.Net DevExpress Gridview that displays data (number of columns 8) and except first column all other columns are ASPx button as link columns. All these 7 columns further open grid to display their respective data. Now, for each row, user needs to click 7 different columns to get all data and export into excel separately. So, do we have any features to export all these seven columns data into seven different excel sheet and inside a single excel file on single click (suppose on each row click).
or do we have any control to export each data table of dataset in separate excel sheet inside a  single Excel file.
Please suggest.

Hi,
In a store, I need to make sure only one record is flagged - so I need to unflagged the other records when a diff record is flagged.
To do this, I need to know which record was previously flagged.   The flagged  column is a boolean on the record.   If a user flags a new record while a prior record is flagged, I need to know which record to unflag.
A broader, more important question is:   On a modified, inserted, etc event, how do I tell what was modified, inserted, etc?   They don't appear to have any parameters.  
Thanks,
Nick H 

Hi,

Best regards.

Hi there,
Would you please be able to advise me... I have a requirement that when the user hits "save" on the popup editor of the datagrid, then the user should be prompted via an additional popup to enter some data before the record can be saved.
For example - If an order's status is being set to confirmed by a user, then they hit save. Then they will be shown a popup which asks them to type in the customer's email address and phone number into fields within the popup before the record can be saved.
Is this do-able? Please let me know if I can explain better!
Best wishes
Matthew 

I like to make it easier to see what time is under the mouse pointer to make it easier to select the right spot when customer have a lot of resources.
I looked for hint functionality in the properties/events and in demos but cannot find where/how to do thin, can you give  me a hint as to where I get started?
I like a hint to show eg 14:40 when the mouse is not over an event. (I have separate  hints already over events)

Hello. 
One of our user's most request using our software is that the first impression of a report take too much time to show (in preview dailog or direct print).
 We supposed that the report is compiled the first time we are printing a data linked to that report, and is cached for the next prints. 
Is there a way to pre load a list of most printed report (ticket report, bill report...) in another thread when user is connecting to his session in our application ? 
Do you have some optimisation advice to speed up the first report execution for a datatype when printed ? 
All our report are created using the Report V1 module. 
Thank you.

Hello!
In previous versions of devexpress controls, the default padding of the PopupControl dxpc-content  was for all themes: 
. In the new version (17.2.5), there is a difference for the MaterialCompact theme according to defined stylesheets in _Layout.cshtml.
In the attached sample, there is a button which launchs an empty popup. If stylesheets NavigationLayout and Editors are defined, the default padding of dxpc-content is 
. However, if stylesheets GridView, NavigationLayout and Editors are defined, the default padding of dxpc-content 
. But in my project, I haven't grid and I don't want to load GridView styles.
If I change the theme of the project and I choose MetropolisBlue, the default padding of dxpc-content is always 
.
So, why there is this behaviour in the last version 17.2.5 and not in previous versions?
Thanks for your help!
Best regards!

Hello,
As the TableOfContent object is only placeable in the reportHeaderBand or reportFooterBand, i was wondering if there is a way to use the same Page Header/ Footer on the Table of Contents Pages as we use in the rest of the report. This customer request occured to us multiple times, as some find it important to have the same pagelayout through the whole document.
I'm used to code the report entirely without the designer, so i hope you can provide me a solution, or at least an idea for a workaround.
Thank you very much

Hello support team,
I faced the same problem and I agree to Pablo Leon that this is not the way it should be. Not after 4 years of knowing the problem. It is obvious that end users want to create a list of items for further processing and (at least in large tables) also use the filter to find the desired items. It's a very unusual behahiour of the grid to clear selection on setting a filter.
Where is your problem to implement the expected behaviour (at least as an option)? You show a workaround, so it should be possible to implement it in standard grid.
Btw, I tried to use the workaround and noticed the following issues:
- LookAndFeel is not considered, instead Windows system color settings are used
- The check colum caption is hard coded and not automatically localized like in standard grid
- The checkbox in column header ("select all") cannot be hidden or disabled like in standard grid
Taking this into account the workaraound is no substitute for a real implementation and not an acceptable solution for the problem. I, and I think many other developers, would be happy if you would think about this once more.
Thank you.

When pressing CTRL+SHIFT+Q and the jump to window opens, I find it hard sometimes to find the method I need because I also have unit tests that start with the same name of the function I am looking for. Please show a different icon for methods and for unit tests so I can distinguish between them faster than scanning the entire list of methods starting with the same name to find the actual method and not the unit tests testing it

Hello support team,
The two actions "... GoBackward and ... GoForward" are only active in the "DayView" view. Would not it make sense to make these two actions visible to all views? Have your example code made years ago built into the two actions, actually works fine (see video). Would be fine to implement this.

Hello, i have problems with memory leak. Can you please assist me address this issue.
I use SciTech .NET Memory Profiler, and get the following information:
 
The Form (frmLieferantenPlanung) and the XtraGrid.GridControl (DXBandedGrid) is disposed, but cant be collected from GC. The next item not disposed seems to be AdvBandedGridViewInfo..
I'm using inheritance and complex UserControl mechanics, so i cant simply create a test-application for you to reproduce this...
I found other issues of this type reported in your forum, and worked through the "solutions", but still cant address my issue.. I'm disposing my UserControls correctly etc.

Hello,
I have GridLookUpEdit that should validate its value after one Enter key press. I managed to write code that handles key press while bypassing GridLookUpEdit's popup window:
And the binding for edit value looks like this:
So updating source object should happen only after validation. Now, the problem is - DoValidate method in KeyDown event doesn't seem to cause validation in this case. EditValue changes correctly, but it still doesn't update source object - at least not until second key press, which is what I want to avoid here. Could you please tell me, how can I solve this issue?

How to hide search panel group in TreeListView using c# code?

I have a DxDataGrid. The row editor is launched with a popup (I have checked with a form and I have the same problem).
 One of the field to edit is of type  string and I want to use a TextArea field type to input the text.
The text is a short description that may contain line returns (pressing enter).
But when I press enter, the text area editor does not append a new line character, it tries to validate the entire form.
The official demo of the textarea editor works well and accepts return chars.
What  am I doing wrong ?
The datafield name I'm talking about is "activite" 
Below is the html code of the component.
There is no js error in the console.

Hi, 
The requirement is to include a ColorPickEdit into dialog.
For instance, I can call this code from a button click event. 
I tried:
            ColorPickEdit cpe1 = new ColorPickEdit();            
            using (PopupColorPickEditForm popupForm = new PopupColorPickEditForm(cpe1))
            {
                popupForm.StartPosition = FormStartPosition.CenterScreen;
                 if (popupForm.ShowDialog(cpe1.FindForm()) == System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult.OK)
                {
                    Color color = (Color)cpe1.EditValue;                    
                }
The problem is that the 
 does NOT close its dropdown immediately after changing the edited value and everthing freezes.
How can I solve it ?

Hello,
We are encountering a mismatch behaviour in spreadsheet control.
We have a read only table with a defined data range (like C10:D20). 
Using right click on header row,
If we try to insert row  at 15th row, we correctly have a warning.
But if we delete the 15th row, the row is deleted without any protection!
Is it an issue you have fixed in next version? 
If not, what is the best way to not allow user to delete row containing read-only table data range?
Thx in advance

Hi
I'm currently trying to write some unit tests (using standard VSTest, no 3rd party library like nUnit) and as long as I'm starting only the tests everything runs fine - the problem comes when I'm starting the test runner with coverage. Then the Test Runner freezes (I only have very few tests at the moment that usually finish in a few seconds), the only output I get is "Test started..." and a "loading" bar in the VS footer that stays there for long (I've waited for some minutes but it didn't disappear). Also the code coverage stays at 0 lines, probably because the runner never finishes. This isn't probably enough information to find the bug/wrong configuration, so please tell if you need more data. I'm using VS2017 professional, the solution itself contains some vb.net projects, LOC totally about 7000 (I guess this influences the execution time). The installed Devexpress Components version is 17.1.6 (not the same as CodeRush) as I need this one because of developing/fixing some already released software.

Working with a pivot table using method described in 
 I get a correct filter, but in this case they show like the attached example.
However when the user applies a filter no such box is displayed.
Is this some difference between regular filters and something called prefilter? I find no information in the help on the difference between filter and prefilter.
Ideally I would all filters to be displayed as in the attached screenshot (I manually display other filters), but at the very least, be treated in the same way, how can I accomplish this?
 

Hello,
the excel export of dxPivotGrid seems always to produce string values for row or column fields independently of the dataType property of the field definition. I have some special data which contains number or date values as elements of a row or column field.  That works, the aggregation runs fine with that but the excel export produces string data values. You can see that in the attached image. The apostrophe before the number in the expression row of excel (or open office calc) indicates that the value is considered as string. If these values are to be used for excel calculations one must convert that painfully.
The attached code shows that. Does the dataType property have any meaning at all for row / column area fields or is it just used for data area fields? Do you have any recommendation to provide the right data types on export?
Best regards
Matthias

I want to drag a row from TableView and drop it on a usercontrol next to it. But I don't want row dissappear from TableView.
How can I do it?

The issue is not with the default set value. It happens only when I try to enter the number that exceed the maxlength = 16 and then I continue to type decimals. I have no idea where those returned numbers come from.
In one example: 

I have a parent form which has multiple field in, one of which is WKNO,  When I select a drop down in a one to many relationship I would like the value of the wkno in the dropdown to auto fill the WKNO in the parent.  Can you please advise how this is done?

Hello,
Im having a problem with the theme designer that when i select any of the controls under "Windows"  im not getting a preview so i cant filter click to get the colors i need. The rest of the control seem to produce a preview though.
So i cant find where i changed the button colors (Minimize, Maximize and Close butttons). Both for ThemedWindow and the DXMessageBox window. Nor can i find the style for the DXMessageWindow Titlebar text.
Some help with locating these colors would be appreciated.

Let's say I have 4 fields in the row area. Calling the method PivotGridControl.GetRowIndex(Object[]) works but only if I pass values for the 1st row area field -or- for the 1st and 2nd row area fields. As soon as I add a value for the third field, the result is always -1. I have tried with many different combinations of fields of various data types and the result is always the same.

Is there a way to view a PDF in the viewer, then open it in Adobe Acrobat, add markup and then save? When I do this, I get the attached error (the file is in use). I imagine that because the PDF is being viewed in the devexpress viewer, that it is "in use".
Is there any way around this? My users need full adobe features to markup documents, but ideally would be doing this from the devexpress viewer (using a button that opens the file in Adobe Acrobat). 



I'm also trying to add "Select all" option in the tagbox before my datasource list, I have successfully added this using 



which seems to partially work, however when selected the value is an empty string.
What is the best way for me to implement this?

Hello,

In case, is it possible to have an example?

We're trying to implement functionality where clicking on the Label (and only the Label) of a LayoutItem would copy the contents of the associated contents of the LayoutItem. I've tried a few things, but am not getting the behavior I'm looking for.
// Note: I have a public CopyTitleToClipboard method in my ViewModel that sets the clipboard contents to Entity.Title. If there is a way to just copy the contents of the associated LayoutItem that would suffice.
* Adding EventToCommand to the LayoutItem is the closest I've gotten. This does hit my CopyTitleToClipboard method, but the drawback is this fires if someone clicks near the edit field but not in it. So if they're clicking around near the TextEdit the event might mistakenly fire if their mouse lands within the bounds of the LayoutItem but outside of the TextEdit. I don't know how often my users would manage to find that little space above and below the TextEdit, but it would be disruptive to them if it happened unexpectedly.
* Trying to set it just to the label gives me the error "A property element cannot be the direct content of another property element."
* By setting the Label contents to a TextBox I am able to customize the label to change the mouse to a hand and underline it to indicate that it is clickable. In this approach, the EventToCommand it not firing, or at least my CopyTitleToClipboard method on the ViewModel isn't firing.
Any guidance on an approach to take would be appreciated.

Is it possible to select the *contents* of multiple cells in a grid with a mousedrag (or at all)?
Basically, I'm looking to replicate the behavior of an HTML Table, where you can partially select text from one cell, and then select partial or full text from other cells.
 The selection behavior I would like to achieve is like as below (open in browser and you can play with it)
Is it possible to get this behavior with a gridcontrol? Currently I can either select multiple full cells, or I can select the internal content of 1 cell, but am then locked into that cell and cannot select outside of it.

Hi DevExpress Team,
   
    We have Gridview with some column Date columns (ColumnType as DateEdit).
   
    Header filter for Date columns is not working as expected and throwing NotSupported Exception from entity framework.
    When clicking on Header filter button, we can see the drop-down, without any FilterValue items.
    For other type of columns its working fine, and we can see the available filter value,
    We have already tried the solution from below link, still unable to use Header filter for the Date column. 
     Version Details -
      
     DevExpress version - 16.2.5.0
     Entity Framework -  6.0.0.0

When the Popup is updated, the form currently updates the Gridview.. Perfect!!! The issue that is occurring is that when i select the "Update" button, although it is updating my Gridview, I don't expect the Popup to close (or hide).  I expect the Gridview to update when the Popup form is closed. When I select "Update" I expect for the Popup form to remain.

Hi,
When i try to load an Xml to dash board viewer i get the following exception in the output window. This makes it slow to load the layout .

Hello,
we want to create some form to simulate the Search form that is shown in Visual Studio 2017 when  we press Ctrl+T keys. Please find attached the image with that Form with the result we want to achieve.
I saw a DevExpress sample similar to the goal in the follwing thread:
I modified this project to use the Office 2016 Colorful skin and also to put the Ribbon RightToLeft property to Yes in order to put the buttons on the title bar at the top-right corner.
The issues I want to fix in the modified project are:
1.- I need to see the Title text left aligned, as the Ribbon->RibbonStyle OfficeUniversal paints it sometimes. But we cannot use the RibobnStyle OfficeUniversal because we want the configurable buttons on the right side and I could not see them with that style, and also the title text moved in some point to be centered.
2.- I also realized at runtime, that when we resize the Form height to a lower height, the buttons on the right side of the title bar dissapear...If I increase the height, they appear again. It is weird.
Please could you help me with this?
Thanks in advance!!!

Hello, 
I have a grid which is grouped by a column by default. Now when the user doubleclicks on a GroupRow, I want to do some action depending on which group row the user clicked.
So far I have been able to check if the user clicked on ANY GroupRow. 
Now I would like to receive the Groups Name/Title to proceed.
I'm aware that I can get a collection of groped columns through 
but I'm not sure how to make the connection between that and the event above.
Thanks in advance!

Hi,
I have a business object with a required property (SocialSecurityNumber with attribute RuleRequiredField). Only a limited number of users is allowed to actually see this number, so I created the necessary security roles to achieve this.
A problem arises when a user is not allowed to view this property, but needs to modify an other property (e.g. the address).  When he tries to persist the record he gets a "Social security number is missing" error. The number is not missing, but because of the permissions he is not allowed to see it and because of the RuleRequiredField attribute he can't save the record.
Is there a way around this?

I'm using a tree list and calling ShowDetail in the treeList's selection changed handler.

When we reload page , we want set the filter by column but the autofilter condition isn't set from  grid.ApplyFilterToColumn.
He is the code where we set the filter by colunns : 
 

Hi
I am becoming much better at creating resource styles for all sorts of items that one can add to a ribbon, however the bar sub item is eluding me thus far.
I can create a standard ribbon button style with ease;
and apply the style in the view's xaml like so;
Put simply is it possible to build up styles for the various BarButtonItems and links and then combime those into a master style that could be added like so;
So far I have this, I'm just trying to figure out how to add the component bar items to it
Many Thanks
Dom
 

In my template I have a dxForm with this field:
I am having an issue where if the user inputs an illegal value that is outside the min/max range, such as 5 for example, and then without pressing the Enter key or removing focus from the number box control goes straight to clicking the form submit button then the value is instantly changed to fit inside the range (5 becomes 3, for example) then the form is submitted.
This is a problem because the user won't know that the value they enter has been changed before they submit the form. I want it instead to keep the illegal value of 5 and display a validation error on the field. 

Hi,

I've got a component that displays 3 DxDataGrid. Each grid has its own distinct custom Rest datasource.
By the first grid,  I have a on/off switch that apply a filter on the first grid.
When the switch is clicked, the datasource gets reloaded and the grid is expected to be refreshed.
Instead of displaying the new filtered values of the first grid, all the the 3 grids gets refreshed (each of their data source being queried again !).
I put some traces and this is what actually happens : 
1) I click on the switch, on ValueChanged is called and the following code is executed:
 2) As a result the data source fetches the correct data from the server, the data is delivered to the browser
3) It should stop here but it continues and refetch all data of the 3 grids, like if I had click refresh on the browser refresh url button.  I do not understand what happens.
If I comment the line 
the filtered data is still fetched from the server, brought back to the browser, but is not displayed in the grid: the grid is not refreshed.
Hence my question: what is the best approach to refresh a data grid on interactive external filtering ?
Thank you.
[EDIT]
I see now why other data sources are also refreshed: they are indeed linked by look up. Still, I do not understand why once loaded with a filter (clientDataSource.load (... ) ),   it is loaded again after this.
Would it be possible to add a callback to the load call and do the refresh afterwards ?
[EDIT2]
I tried the following : 
But it only empties the grid : the grid is  filtered but I intend to filter the data from the server via the data source
Here is the client.component.html file : 
and the component.ts file :

Hello,
We have a text editor for a field which should allow alphanumeric characters and should only allow uppercase letters. The following edit mask works fine but allows tab or new line characters if user is copy/pasting from a text/excel file so I have updated the mask to remove the tab or new line characters as shown under the Modified code section. Now when I type the editor displays the field in uppercase but it saves back into the database as lowercase. Can you please let me know how to resolve this problem?
Original code:
           RepositoryItemTextEdit AccountNumEditor = new RepositoryItemTextEdit();
            AccountNumEditor.MaxLength = 18;
            AccountNumEditor.CharacterCasing = CharacterCasing.Upper;
            AccountNumEditor.Mask.MaskType = DevExpress.XtraEditors.Mask.MaskType.RegEx;
            AccountNumEditor.Mask.EditMask = "[^a-z]*";           
            AccountNumEditor.Mask.UseMaskAsDisplayFormat = true;
 
Modified code:
          AccountNumEditor.Mask.EditMask = "[^a-z][^\r\n\t]*";

Hello!
Im continuing my attempts to launch Mobile application of my Xaf solution. Previously i was experiencing issues with IsInstanceOfType function (

Please, see log file for the details.
Thank you! 

Hi,
It's a follow-up on a previous question. So I use the solution and method aspxSpreadsheet.WorksheetDisplayArea.SetSize () to set fixed columns and rows to show in the window. Just following below example.
However  there is still one slight display adjustment I like to fix. As noticed in demo above, there are white margin area on the right of last fixed column and area beneath last fixed row. So i wonder how we can remove these margin in the display. 
More specifically we use the aspxSpreadsheet in-house and fixed column number is 26. so it necessitates a horizontal scroll bar. As attached image shows, when scroll to the right-most, white margin area shows up. I am trying to eliminate the area either by setting fullscreenmode or set height and width. but they don't serve a neat solution here. 
I wonder if you have any proposal for that. thank you!
Best,
Jiong 

Hello,
I use 2 date edit in Date Range mode like your demo (
)
With the MinDayCount = 1:
1. I delete the start date text.
2. I delete the end date text.
3. I type with my keyboard a new start date.
4. I type the "tabulator" key => End date edit is selected.
The end date edit text is filled. It's the normal behavior.
With the MinDayCount = 0:
1. I delete the start date text.
2. I delete the end date text. 
3. I type with my keyboard a new start date.
4. I type the "tabulator" key => End date edit is selected.
Why the end date edit keeps empty ?
Is it possible to keep the same behavior as the first example? 
Best regards
Vincent

Hi,
I have a DxGrid in my code designed to set authorizations to  multiple entities. There are two different checkbox columns bound to different booleans (note: their status isn't related at all to the row selection- I could only find ways to implement selection-related checkboxes here so far).
A typical use case would be a user would enter a group on the SearchBox, the Grid will filter itself showing only members of said group, and user would click on the column header to select/unselect all visible values.
Simple code for the grid:
Here the fields IsAuthorized and IsReporting are boolean values.
How can I put a checkbox in the column header and make it behave so clicking on the header checkbox will select/unselect all booleans on the visible rows only? Note that just like a selector checkbox. the header column status will be updated depending on what's being displayed
Thank you

I have a dxDataGrid toolbar where I want to place a button with a logo inside. The logo width gets forced into the default icon size. I have looked at the numerous ways to extend the icon library but I can't seem to find an example on how to place a base64 image inside of the dxButton and specify an image width for the image to scale properly. Please see the attached example. 
How can I scale the image  inside the dxGrid's toolbar button to be similar to the <img> in my example?

Hi,
We are migrating our project to Angular 5 and TypeScript (XtraReports 17.2.4).
We're using the web reporting designer.
1) We're developing  our frontEnd using the document:
1) - In an earlier version angular JS, we created a callback bellow.
2) - We need a repor layout in this callback because we need to save this in our db.
ngAfterViewInit() {
      const report = AppContext.getReport();
      if ((report) && (report.id > 0)) {
        const reportUrl = '';
        const host = 
;
        const container = this.renderer.createElement('div');
        container.innerHTML = Html;
        this.renderer.appendChild(this.scripts.nativeElement, container);
        ko.applyBindings({
          reportUrl,
          requestOptions: {
            host,
            getDesignerModelAction: '/api/1/designer' // Action that returns the Report Designer model.
            
 
          }
        }, this.control.nativeElement);

I use the following connection string to connect my XPO data layer to a database file:
This works file, but these days I decided to move my database file to a shared folder:
It is throwing DevExpress.Xpo.DB.Exceptions.UnableToOpenDatabaseException:

In code using a WinForms GridView control, how do you resize the column where a summary item has been added to the footer via the 'Sum' menu option?
I tried using the gridview.Column[fieldName].BestFit() methosd, but it resizes to a max width of the values within the column NOT taking into account the newly added text and value in the footer.

Hi ,
I wanted to set same font style for all labels that I use in ChartControl . I could not find a property which can be set to achieve this. I have to specify font style for each any every object in a chart control that has label. Do we have something as a base property which gets inherited to all other fonts in the chart control allowing user to update only the required ones?

I have a a grid with many columns.  One of the columns is a GridViewDataTokenColumnBox.  
When i first run the grid, the value in this cell is Appraisal, Income / Expense  (which is the text, and not the value)
When i select additional values, and go to save the updates (using the BatchUpdate method), the value is now
Appraisal, Income / Expense, 4, 6
4 & 6, are the values of the 2 tokens i added.
I would expect the values of Appraisal, and Income / Expense to be there instead of the text.
If possible, can you let me know what could be the issue, or provide an example of how to do batchupdating with a GridViewDataTokenBoxColumn

We are using the WebDocumentViewer to display reports using XtraReports in MVC.
Some clients get a blank screen with a broken page icon, Other clients are fine. Please see the file attached.
EDIT: Please note that this behaviour was reported randomly occuring since yesterday while no code was deployed that could change the application.  It would be helpful if you could point me to the areas i should be looking at to diagnose the issue.

Hi Guys,
we heavily use simplified criteria syntax  - and we sometimes hit following Problem. developers normaly know and write Syntax with an single & - but it happens that an developer will not notice and write && in the criteria Syntax which will lead to a wrong query, for example:
var c = new BinaryOperator("Test", false) && new BinaryOperator("Test", false); -> wrong
var c1 = new BinaryOperator("Test", false) & new BinaryOperator("Test", false); -> correct
is there technical any possibility to generate an warning / error in such Situation?

I have a series of UC's, each containing all code to talk to SQL, etc. (self contained)
I have a 'driver' aspx page that contains a PlaceHolder and a button for choosing which UC to load/execute.
When fired, the GV does show, but none of the CSE will fire (StartNewRecord, Updte, etc.)
I'm dynamically loading via in my aspx code behind:
        Dim ucState As UserControl = Page.LoadControl("~/UserControls/States.ascx")
        PlaceHolder1.Controls.Add(ucState)
I've tried reference both in web.config and in the aspx page itself.
as mentioned, the GV shows no problem.
I have an             <ClientSideEvents Init="OnInit" /> to set the height of the GV, also no issues.
I have three separate buttons (ASPxButton) for new, edit, delete. 
the 'new' button has:                 <ClientSideEvents Click="function (s, e) { OnNewClickStates(s, e); }" />
which when pressed does not fire.
I inside a aspx page or loaded up front via uc1:States runat="server" ID="States" /> everything is fine.
It 'appears' something is not be registered properly for all? CSE's?

Hi,
i want to set validation of a text box based on the selection of select box 
Let think that my selection box have two value 
1. Length 20
2. Length 10 
have one text box , if Selectbox .value=length 20 then textbox max length should be 20 if selectbox.value=10 then textbox max length =10 
how can i accomplish this 
please help me  

Is there a way to loop through the series in a chart, that are being created via a pivot grid, and set something so that they will show up a regular series in the chart designer. As it is, there isn't a way to set the color, thickness etc. for each series in the chart.

We do some autocapitalization in our AutoCorrect event handler, and a customer wants this functionality after an autocorrection has happened
For example, the desired behaviour is to both correct and capitalize "acheive" :
"Previous sentence. acheive" ->  "Previous sentence. Achieve "
but the AutoCorrect event does not seem to fire after the table entry correction, so we can't do the capitalization 
"Previous sentence. acheive" -> "Previous sentence. achieve " 
Can AutoCorrect be configured for this behaviour?

I have added a dxList to that either will contain a list of items or not based upon a user selection from a dxSelectBox.
The problem is that when the dxList does contain data, the width is millions of pixels wide and pushes content off the viewable capability of most browsers.
I do not know who is calculating the width to be millions of pixels or where that width is coming from.
I read one of these other questions about width not being calculated for some reason or other and to set display to block. I tried that in a few places.
My sample project is a Visual Studio Code project.
 When you run the project the "Role Name" Select Box drives the data for the 2 dxList objects. Either empty for "DB Admin" or a list of objects for "Does It All".
When "Does It All" is selected the dxList is driving the width to change to be millions of pixels wide and the "Description" and "Privileges" are completely pushed out of any visible range from the page.
How can I determine how this million pixel width is being determined?
How do I rectify the width to fit the widest item content? 
I do not know the size of the content to set a fixed width as the data for the list will dynamically be loaded at run time when the Role Name SelectBox value is changed. 

I am using XtraGrid in WinForms application. When I right click on the Column Header a menu pops up. I want to hide/remove some of the options in the menu. See Attached Pic. I have crossed the options that I do not want to be available. Please point me the settings/properties in XtraGrid that will do it.

Hello,
Is there a way to create Scheduler Report that shows Events as vertical column, Dates as horizontal, and resources in the cells or I need to feed data to XtraReports V2 and do it there? Something like

Thank you. 

I have a view with a Html.DevExpress().ListBox data editor and a model of type List<SelectListItem>. The listbox is populated by the BindList method, with the model as a parameter. 
In my action method, I am building a list of  SelectListItems to pass to the view. Some of the SelectListItems have the Selected property set to true.
I would expect these SelectListItems to show up as being checked when the view is rendered, however they are not.
What am I missing?  

Hi, 
We're using code below to change the color of a row and making not visible command buttons. It works fine but after the RejillaPrincipal_CommandButtonInitialize is executed and you try to move over the grid (any kind of movement) the browser display next error: 
A primary key field specified via the KeyFieldName property is not found in the underlying data source. Make sure the field name is spelled correctly. Pay attention to the character case.
If you comment the code inside RejillaPrincipal_CommandButtonInitialize the error disapears.
Any hint?
Thanks,

I have a DevExpress license. One of my team members doesn't have one. I know he cannot publish the solution.
I will publish the final product on the production server. But I wonder if he will have any issue while working on the other part of the project that doesn't have a DevExpress component in it.
Especially I wonder if he will be able to build a solution locally for his own testing.
Thanks

When I add a fa icon to a button, the button event won't fire if I click directly on the icon? How can we make the button click event fire when the icon inside the button is clicked?

So I have a tile control which loads a frame as its detail page. The detail page in this case contains a page control with one tab sheet and on that tab sheet is a panel aligned alClient. The tab sheet has an OnShow event which sets the caption to be the panel's perimeter as a string. (Demo project attached)
To replicate the issue I'm having, click the tile item to open the detail page (the blue box's caption will be the correct perimeter). Then click the back button. From now on, every time the tile item is clicked, the panel will not have the finalized height and width when the perimeter is calculated in the tab sheet's OnShow event and the perimeter displayed will be wrong. Clicking the panel recalculates the perimeter to show that it will change.
I know that one way to solve this is to post a message in the OnShow event, but this solution isn't great in my real scenario because the code I am triggering in the OnShow event involves visual changes and looks bad when it occurs after the detail page is already visible which happens sometimes if the message takes a relatively long time to be processed.

Hello there,
How can I remove the x button just like

Team,
My Item source of treelist view is bound to data table . I want to change the background color of the selected cell in a row after I change the cell value.
If I change another cell on the same row , then I want to revert the cell color which I previously altered. So at a time, there will one cell on the row which will have this color change. 
How can I change this through behavior/Converter in optimized way. I don't want UI Thread to hang for long to revert the color of the row.
example:
Row 1 Cell 1 -> Change Value --> Color changed from default background to green
Row 1(same row) Cell 2 --> Change  Value --> Color change from default background to green . and cell 1 background change back to default.

Hi,
Just wondering if it is possible to add filtering and sorting to the web forms version of dashboards as it is currently available in the desktop version. 

I need to programmatically move the vertical scroll bar on the data grid to the bottom - displaying the last row.  Don't necessarily want to select the last row.  Is there a way to do this?

Hi,
I am working on a  graph that uses ChartControl , XYDiagram2D, LineSeries2D  (WPF)
If multiple Series are being shown, is there an easy way the user can quickly change 
Marker, Line Style, Color, Visible properties of these series items  by clicking on the legend or other means.
The requirement specification that was given is that the end-user would be able to click on any aspect of the legend and be able to change its properties.  For example, if the user clicks on the line, the user would be able to modify its thickness and style directly from the legend.  Is this something that is currently possible?  If so, do you have an example showing off this capability?
Thanks
 

I am reviewing my logs, and see that one of our customers has some issue that looks to be triggering a flood of events into Logify.  Two questions:
1.) When this happens, does it count against the number of submissions that are permitted?  
2.) Is there any version where it wont report the same error more than X times? 
Example:  
Thanks.

Hi DevExpress Team,
I have a project that builds successfully with WPF v14.2 on Win7 Service Pack 1 under Visual Studio 2015, and here're the DLLs used.
DevExpress.Charts.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Data.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Mvvm.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Printing.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Charts.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Controls.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Core.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Docking.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.v14.2.Extensions.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Layout.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.LayoutControl.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Printing.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Printing.v14.2.Service.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Ribbon.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Themes.Office2010Black.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.XtraPrinting.v14.2.dl
In project references, I manually changed reference to these four
DevExpress.Charts.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Data.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Mvvm.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Printing.v14.2.Core.dll
to reference their v17.1 counterparties, and the build fails with errors like these two
Error CS0012 The type 'ColumnSortOrder' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'DevExpress.Data.v14.2, Version=14.2.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b88d1754d700e49a'.

besides, I got LINQ related errors like this one
Error CS1061 'string' does not contain a definition for 'IsEmpty' and no extension method 'IsEmpty' accepting a first argument of type 'string' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) 
So I gave up manual upgrade to v17.1 and ran  Project Conveter in VS 2015 to upgrade to v17.1 and got same kinds of errors.
Do you have similar reported issues? Any suggestions are appreciated.
Thank you,

I used one of the examples given for adding "watermark". I load the document into richeditcontrol and the "watermark" covers up the header. But when I save the document as RTF and open in WORD the header is not covered up by the "watermark" image. 
so by modifying the procedure for adding the "watermark" to put the image lower than the header and made it smaller. in the richeditcontrol it still overlays the header but when saved and opened in WORD it shows the image past the header like I was anticipating. 
I changed the createposition and the size of the shape object. But in richeditcontrol it still overlays the header.
I don't care about the position and size as long as it doesn't overlay on top of the header.
 

I am reaching here, but do you have anything like a notification bubble option in one of your controls?  What I really want is a little bubble that I can show above a menu item with it's own separate menu like pull down to show the user quick information about the notification.
I was hoping to hack it in with jquery, but bugs in IE are making that very difficult.  I have looked through your controls and do not see anything like this, but thought it was worth asking.
Attached you will see a mock-up of what it might look like, with a green notification bubble showing the number of notifications a user has for a given menu item. 

 Hi,
I am trying to bind dxSelectBox by using CustomStore via Web API. Please, see attached project:
public class AreaController : ApiController

        [HttpGet]
        public HttpResponseMessage Get(DataSourceLoadOptions loadOptions)

            var cal = new CustomDictionary() { ID = "2", Name = "Cal" };
            return Request.CreateResponse(DataSourceLoader.Load(new CustomDictionary[] { dig, cal }, loadOptions));
        }
       
    }
OPM.report = function (params) {
    "use strict";
    var viewModel = {
        formItems: [

Hi.
Does XtraReport support OpenType Font in windows 7?
Windows 10 is possible using OpenType Font in XtraReport, But Windows 7 Cannot.
Why? 

Is it possible to use to Google material icons (
 the Bootstrap controls suite ?
In the documentation, I only see references to Glyphicons and FontAwesome.
If so, do you have a sample showing this integration ? 

We created a Dx grid with a wrapper ,we able to load the data but the cell template is not loading the template for that particular tab.

I have an ASPxSplitter and in the right pane there is an ASPxFileManager that allows ".jpg", ".png", ".gif" and ".pdf" file extensions.
When thumbails are displayed in the file manager it is possible to "see the con tent" of each file except for PDF files. Thumbnails of PDF files are shown by displaying a white sheet and the Acrobar logo. I have attached a screenshot for your reference.
Is it possible to show "the content"  of PDF files in thumbails very much the same as "jpg", "pn g" and "gif" images?
Best regards,

Hi,
So instead of using my own buttons I am trying to use the ChartBarController buttons so I can swap to different chartcontrols easily.
When I control loading a templated layout, I save the source and then restore the source.
However, when using the ChartController load layout button, the button's itemclick event fires before the file select dialog, so I can save the current datasource to a variable, fine...
However, can't figure out what event to use once the layout has been reloaded.  It's not the ChartControlLayout event...
So what event should I use?

Hi DevTeam,
We are using Analysis report in our XAF application. It came to our notice recently that if a field which is a object property(for instance AssignedTo), is added to the analysis report,  click add button of PivotGrid Field selection dialogue, the pop up tree list will show the AssignedTo node as unselected, its default property of AssignedTo,in this case is Display Name, is selected. If select AssignedTo node again, and click OK button, nothing will be added to the PivotGrid Field selection dialogue. This behavior is misleading, 
1. Since the I selected AssignedTo, AssignedTo node should be grey out after that. 
2. Secondly If I select AssignedTo node again, nothing happens, the system should greyout AssignedTo node in the first place.
Can you review this, see if this behavior is a bug or by-design?

Tony 
 

When using the Listbox with Templates, I am trying to work out how I can customise the placement of the context buttons, I can't seem to find a way to either link the context buttons to an element within the template or to find a alignment property as to where the context buttons show appear, I need them to show TopRight of the item, however they are showing MiddleRight.
How do we set the context button position?

Hi,
I have a batchedit grid that has a number of columns grouped.
The following setting is turned on.
DevExpress hangs.
if I have it turned off  I can expand each row individually.  The problem is for the grid I need it to display all data expanded.  With the batchedit grid and continuous paging I expected that it would just render the pages as I scroll down the list.
I'm binding the data  using entity framework.
I've attached an example of the sheet.  The above shows the columns.
 

Hi,
I'm using continuous scrolling on most of my grids.  How can I set it up that the initial render loads enough data to fill the screen and then reduce the data page size to say 10 rows at a time.
Currently I have it set to 40 rows, this is to guarantee that the initial page is completely filled with data.  but I would prefer the page size to be smaller than this for later loads. 

When WindowsFormsSettings.ForceDirectXPaint() is used with a TileView's OptionTiles.ScrollMode set to ScrollButtons, artifacts (the scroll buttons) are present when scrolling through the tiles. Removing the DirectX call solves the issue, so it's related to that.
Attached is a sample project and video. 

Hello and thank you for your time.
I can't seem to get drag and drop events to fire on the BarButtonItem in a ribbon control.  We have a button that open a new rich edit control  and would like to be able to drop an existing document onto the button to have the app open that doc.
We can do it in winforms but not WPF.
Is this possible?
Thank you. 

Hi,

i want to import data from excel files by using DataTableExporter.Export Method but it does not consider AutoIncrement/Computed Column  which is additional column in datatable.

Hello 
Today I upgraded from WinForms to Universal (and from 17.2.3 to 17.2.5).  I have a project that was developed using the old version - and when I open it and upgrade the project to the new version of DevExpress.  (as I would expect)
 
I can open the project and Build it.  However, when I try to run it - I get the error message shown in the attachment. 
 
Any thoughts as to why this might be?  The PDB files from my understanding contain debugging information.  When I installed the new version/upgrade - I choose to install all options - including source code (although I do not really need it).  
When I re-install without Source - I get a different error (see image "NoSource"")
However, I seem to be able to open a new project and run it (basically a blank form) - even if I deliberately generate an exception - it all works as expected on the basically blank form.  
thoughts?

Hi,
I'm unsure how to filter / sort custom types in XtraGrid.
I've attached an example of a simple grid with filtering of a custom type.
The resulting filtering is not as I expected as I assumed it would use the CompareTo method of my class to filter but it doesn't. I guess it must be simply filtering using the ToString() value.
Also, the grid won't permit column sorting.
Can you please assist?
Thanks

Hi
I want use a combobox in the search panel of my gridview. The combobox values are from an Enum. Here the partial code in the gridview settings:
            //get list of entries for search panel
            var resManager = App_Enums.ResourceManager;
            var enumType = typeof(RegistrationCurrentOrAll);
            var enumValues = Enum.GetValues(enumType).Cast<object>();
            Dictionary<int, string> searchPanelValues = new Dictionary<int, string>();
            foreach (var actEnum in enumValues)
            {
                searchPanelValues.Add((int)actEnum, PrestaEnumHelper.GetResourceValueForEnumValue(actEnum, resManager));
            }
            settings.SettingsSearchPanel.ColumnNames = "";
            settings.SettingsSearchPanel.CustomEditorName = "Search_Data";
            //settings.SettingsText.SearchPanelEditorNullText = App_Views.SearchInParts;
            settings.Settings.ShowTitlePanel = true;
            settings.SetTitlePanelTemplateContent(c => {
                Html.DevExpress().ComboBox(cbSearch =>
                {
                    cbSearch.Name = "Search_Data";
                    cbSearch.SelectedIndex = 0;
                    cbSearch.Properties.TextField = "Value";
                    cbSearch.Properties.ValueField = "Key";
                    cbSearch.Properties.ValueType = typeof(int);
                }).BindList(searchPanelValues).Render();
                //place other controls here
            });
In the controller i have an action GetPartial:
        public ActionResult GetPartial(string PartialViewName, string Search_Data)
But i receive only a value if the parameter Search_Data is from type string. But i define in the combobox settings the Key as ValueField. Should my search not passe an integer to the controller?
What do i wrong?
Best regards

Hello,
I have a gridview with a column that displays links to a social media site. I would like the user to be able to click the link that is displayed in the column, and open the social media site in a new tab. How can I accomplish this? I was looking at some examples, and tried to piece the functionality together with this: 
var linkedInCol = settings.Columns.Add("LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", MVCxGridViewColumnType.HyperLink);
    linkedInCol.Visible = false;
    HyperLinkProperties properties = linkedInCol.PropertiesEdit as HyperLinkProperties;
    String urlFormatString = "{0}";
    properties.NavigateUrlFormatString = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(urlFormatString);
    properties.TextField = linkedInCol.Caption;
 but the link was treated as a redirect to an action, rather than an external website.
Thanks,
Sean

I was trying to get the collection's list view so that I can append filter to the data collection source of the list view.
But everytime  I am trying to get list view from the deatil view , I am getting null value.
Am I doing anything wrong.?
Here is the code snippet.
ListPropertyEditor listedfor=((DetailView )View).FindItem("TaskListCollection") as ListPropertyEditor;


I looked at the demo. Looks like on the bootstrap I can create a Single Pie. My application requires a number of pie that is not predetermined a priori.

Hello,
I am using DevAVMVC as a template to build a webapp against. I have been having trouble trying to figure out how the search bar works. Specifically, I would like to know how the Gridview gets the string from the search bar, and uses it to filter the grid/highlight the matching text in the rows. I could not find anything in the scripts.js file that was obviously responsible for filtering/highlighting with the searchbar text. Could you please explain this mechanism?
(Feel free to ignore this next paragraph if it does not add any clarity)
Some background, if it helps: I am trying to add the filtering functionality to the girdview, and having it work alongside the searchbar. I am only able to get the searchbar functionality to work when I have the searchbox call the MainCallbackPanel callback, and not when I call a separate action that loads the gridview in the same way. The MainCallbackPanel clears out my filters, while the separate action does not, so I would like to figure out what the difference is, when they are both eventuall loading the grid with the same call: PartialView()
Thanks for your help!

Hi support,
I have an issue about getting date value from a DateTime property. I made a property (Schedule No) which is for collect or merge (concat) string from few property (No, Activities, DateOfSchedule) and I successfully did it. My issue is can't get only date without time from DateOfSchedule property. I try to create a PersistentAlias and use PadLeft() or GetDate() method, but still get the time. How I can solve it? below I attach the screenshot and piece of code.
Thank you.

I'm create documents by adding a control. However the DocumentName doesn't get set. Also setting it in code doesn't work either.

Hi,
I have the following scenario:
- TokenEdit control with  EditMode set to "Manual"
- Separators property that contains exclusively ";" 
Why setting in code EditValue to a string than contains "," ("abc;def;ghi,jkl")  result is splitted into four strings, instead of the three expected ?
Same behaviour inputting text at runtime. 
I need that only ";" character determines conversion to text blocks, operating in manual mode
What I'm doing wrong?
Please look at attached project 
Thanks in advance

Hello Svetlana,
we used your "At the same time, the 
 mechanism still allows you to apply the 
 operator to the necessary columns by setting the 
 property to Like and the 
 property to DisplayText."
it works but any other expression column that depends in its calculations to a column changed to FilterMode=DisplayText , gives #Err   
we are using 17.1.6
what can we do ?
thanks

Hello support team,
Again i hope that you can give me a direction on how to solve the following problem:
I have a standard grid view showing companies with the usual fields like name, country, city, etc. Each company can be of multiple company types like owner, operator, agency, etc. This is shown as a relation on a tab below each company. Now the question: the end user wants to group or filter by these company types, e.g. show only those companies which are of type operator. But there is no column in the master row which could be used for grouping or filtering. Is there a way to achive this anyway?
Thank you.

Hi
I have this problem where I need to export a report which I made in XtraReport into an excel document. But the user wants to be able to filter on 2 of the column, like the status column.
Like if you have, "New", "Call Back", "Pending". They want to be able to click on the column header in excel after exported and choose which of this statuses should show. 
Have been going through all your documentation but can't seem to find something to fit my solution.

Hi,
I am very excited to discover your new check box column on the grid to help with selecting multiple records, without having to use the keyboard.
Question: I am trying to make it possible for the user to be able to click anywhere on the line to select it (since that is what they are used to with my previous workaround I implemented).
I have played with the following properties, but not managed to find the correct combo that does what I need:
CheckBoxPosition, CheckBoxVisibility, ClearPersistentSelectionOnOutsideClick, MultiSelect, MultiSelectMode, and ShowCheckBoxesDynamically properties 
It looked like using:
OptionsSelection.MultiSelectMode := msmPersistent
was going to do it for me, but that only helps once the line has already been selected. 
 I need it to keep my previous selection, but then tick/untick my new selection as well as I click on other lines
Is this possible, or do I need to stick to my old workaround I was using previously? (which involved Mouse Enter/Leave events, and using SendKeys for the Ctrl key char, and gave hassles when click on grid headers for sorting).

Hi there, 
I have searched through your KB and have not been able to find a satisfying answer although simillar questions have been asked - please help me out or point in the right direction.
What I am trying to achieve is to create a datetime editor for my application in which the user could enter certain shortcuts (more on that below) as well as regular dates - all that in w a windows forms application (which is important as most of your answers I have found pertained to WPF). 
Shortcuts: eg. T+11 (for Today plus eleven days), Y (yesterday), or 13 (for 13th day of current month and year).
Of course the logic needed to resolve the shortcuts to proper dates is not a problem. The problem lies in the events needed to handle it and/or right approach - which I obviously can't figure out.
I have had some success:
- set the masktype to RegEx, and editMask ".+" (all input)
- have a handler for TextChanged event (where i process the input but not output anything, just store the info)
- have a handler for LostFocus event (where I want to display date based on input).
Two things happen:
a. When I click out of the dateedit control and therefore move the focus out of it into some other control (via mouse) everything works fine.
b. When I tab out of the dateedit then I end up with a default datetime entered into to the control (0001-01-01).
(in both cases the lostfocus is fired but in the later it's like an extra event on dateedit's part has been fired)
Hope you can help me out.
Thanks,
Adam

Hi, 
tryingo to access event of ImageEditor event changed from MVVM. It is the same XAML as above but modified for this event. But it seems not to work.
 


                                To control the WaitIndicator control's visibility, use the

Hello,
I use the DevExpress.ui.notify function  to display multiple notification at the same time (playing with the position option in order stack the notifications)
I also set the closeOnOutsideClick to allow users to close the notifications but when two or more toasts are displayed the click close only the last opened toast.
Is it the intended behaviour ? If yes how select all the opened toast (in order to close all of them on the hiding event)?

Hi,
i? have got an issue with a lookupedit and i have tried almost all other knowledge base articles, but i still can't fix it. 
T?he situation:
I? have got a user control on which there is a lookupedit. Everything is done in code, so binding, setting the edit value etc etc. The code loads data for the lookupedit into a datatable. After that the lookupedit's datasource, display member and value member are set through code. After that the Editvalue is also set through code. During the setting of the edit value i check the datatype and parse it if needed (like mentioned in another article).
T?he above works if i just open a form with the control on it and set the edit value. The lookupedit shows the right data. BUT if i then change the edit value of the lookupedit the text show / selected doesn't change. The edit value changed event also doesn't fire.
I do have found a way to make it work, which could give you some hints on what is going wrong / what i am doing wrong. If i open de lookupedit once, select a different value from the list the edit value changed event of the lookup edit get's fired. After that everything works as expected. So updating the edit value is instantly reflected into the selected text. 
A?m i doing something wrong when i bind in code? At this moment all i do is set the datasource, display and value member. Should i do some binding stuff with the edit value? Because is that getting done in the control if a select a value from the dropdown?
R?egards,

Hello,
i'm using a  DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonForm with a DevExpress.XtraBars.Ribbon.RibbonControl.
I use the DevExpress Designer (context Menu on RibbonControl -> Run Designer) to create the GUI. I've run into a problem using categories. I can create categories and assign items to them, but on creating new categories and items, the designer confuses different categories in other menus.
Please see the attached screenshot . In "Designer_Categories.png" you can see two of my categories and their assigned items on the left. On the right you can see the items for the selected category "Fenster". The items shown are part of the category "Fang" though.
Am i doing something wrong or is the designer not working properly?

We are developing an App for Android and iOS. For Android, we have been working with the same apk-template for the last couple of weeks. 
After we now rebuild the apk-template  our application has a much smaller size (3.4 MB instead of >13 MB) does not run anymore on our Android devices. On iOS it works, except the issue with the not showing icon.
Any recommendations on what might be wrong on our side?

Hi,
i have a grid with a column with a special celltemplate.
The celltemplate is build in the oncellprepared event.

The column is now displayed in special color and a text replacement of the original number value in the column.
If i now make a grouping with this column, the group header is only the original column value (number).
Is there any way to get the group header also with the cell template?

Hi,
Is it possible to modify the display order of the (default) command buttons:
It seems that when you use:
settings.CommandColumn.ShowNewButton = true;
settings.CommandColumn.ShowDeleteButton = true;
settings.CommandColumn.ShowEditButton = true;
The display order is fixed.
Is there somekind of "DisplayIndex" property or something or do I have to create a special template for this? 

I referred T180715 its working fine as per my requirement.
But I am grouping in my grid control and want to hide expander at group row.
please refer the attached code for better explanation.

Hello,
I'm looking for a solution to provide a design time editor for SvgImage objects (in my own custom controls) for the property grid of Visual Studio.
The editor provided by DevExpress is doing it very fine, so of course I do not want to reinvent the wheel.
So, the question is: Can I use the SvgImage Editor for my own controls? 
Convenient would be a possibility to write code like this:
Currently this code won't work, because DevExress.Utils.Design.SvgImageEditor doesn't exists. 
UPDATE:
Everything is fine and works as expected. My Issue was caused by a missing reference.

I handle the customisecontextitem event and can see the contextitem in the event args but if i change anything like caption, visibility or any other property it doesnt seem do anything.

Hi,
I'm using the scheduler control with a custom appointment form.
On the Ok button click i want to check if the values are compliant with a set of rules (located in the database).
Where do i place the validation?
 I tried the frmCustomPlanningForm_Validating event, but it's never called.
If i do it on the ok button click, the record is already written to the database.

Hi,
Something I cannot explain is happening in the GridView.
I have these classes:
  public class CommentsGrid
  {
    public int ClaimId { get; set; }
    public List<ClaimComment> Comments { get; set; }
  }
The property Comments is a list of this class:
 
  public class ClaimComment
  {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateAdded { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Comment { get; set; }
    public List<FileInfo> Files { get; set; }
  }
The Files-property is a list of this class:
  public class FileInfo
  {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FileName { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
  }
I have a partial view  _ListCommentsPartial.cshtml:
@model CommentsGrid
@{
    var grid = Html.DevExpress().GridView(settings =>
    {
        settings.Name = "ClaimComments" + DateTime.Now.Second.ToString() + "." + DateTime.Now.Millisecond.ToString();
        settings.KeyFieldName = "Id";
        settings.Columns.Add(column =>
        {
            column.Caption = PortalResources.Resource.GridColumnDate;
            column.FieldName = "DateAdded";
        });
        settings.Columns.Add(column =>
        {
            column.Caption = PortalResources.Resource.GridColumnUserName;
            column.FieldName = "UserName";
        });
        settings.Columns.Add(column =>
        {
            column.Caption = PortalResources.Resource.GridColumnComments;
            column.FieldName = "Comment";
        });
        settings.Columns.Add(column =>
        {
            column.SetDataItemTemplateContent(container =>
            {
             ------------ This is where the error is raised --------------------------------
                var files = (List<Transparent.Portal.Web.Models.FileInfo>) DataBinder.Eval(container.DataItem, "Files");
                Html.RenderPartial("_ListFilesPartial", files);
            });
        });
    });
}
@grid.Bind(Model.Comments).GetHtml()
As you can see I bind the grid to the List<ClaimComment> in the Model-object. That works. The columns "DateAdded", "UserName" and "Comment" are added succesfully. Using the last property, Files, raises an error:
   System.Web.HttpException: 'DataBinding: DevExpress.Web.Data.WebDataRow does not contain a property with the name Files.'
If you check the attachment you can see that there is a property called Files in the Model.Comments-list.
What am I doing wrong?

Dear Devexpress,
I am using a GridControl to display data. The ItemSource is set to a List<ModelClass>, where the some propreties of that ModelClass are other ModelClasses. 
To display data in the grid i am using the following xaml:
<dxg:GridControl.Columns>
   <dxg:GridColumn FieldName="Name" ReadOnly="True"/>
   <dxg:GridColumn FieldName="NumberSet" Header="Number set" ReadOnly="True" />
   <dxg:GridColumn FieldName="Unit.ShortName" Header="Unit" ReadOnly="True"/>
   <dxg:GridColumn FieldName="Container.ShortName" Header="RDL" ReadOnly="True"/>
</dxg:GridControl.Columns>
As you can see, on the third column i am trying to bind to the "ShortName" property of the "Unit" property of the ModelClass that is in the ItemsSource property of the Grid. The "ShortName" property is a string, the "Unit" property is another modelclass. I am experiencing a problem with this approach. Is what ia m trying to achieve the bes approach, or should i perform the binding in a different manner?
The exceptions are listed in the attachment.

Hi, how can i set MS button for calcedit in grid so it store value globally for whole grid, so if i click in other row i can bring back that value ?
THQ 

Just to add, it's absolutely crazy not to offer everything on a piece by piece basis.  With respect, because obviously we are not party to the internal discussions, but I really can see no reason for doing this at all.  When has anyone ever requested less flexibility or choice in development?  Please hurry up and split up the packages.  So there would be more packages for you to manage, is that the only downside?  Surely its all automated anyway.

Hello,
I've created a UserControl containing a LookUpEdit with a TreeView inside the popup, but I'm having the following problems:
- the LookUpEdit's EditValue fires on mouse over instead of on click

- the LookUpEdit's DisplayMember doesn't show the value for the selected item
I attached a sample to demonstate the issues.

Hi Mariya,
Thank you very much for your response. I can now loop through the individual documents. The example you provided exported to PDF, I have modified it to  just grab the HTML instead e.g. 
This gets the HTML but when sending the HTML as an email all seems fine except for images are not displayed. I can see in the HTML that the image is saved as base64 e.g. 
It appears that this is not compatible with Outlook 2007+. 
Do you have any suggestions to get around this? Are there any options with the RichEdit / RichEdit DocumentServer that can change the way this works?
I have seen a few posts that are very old asking for feature enhancements so I thought it would be best to ask first before pulling all my hair out!
Once again, thank you in advance, your help is appreciated.  

Hello,
How can i inject a list of strings in a column area?

Hi.
I'm  migrating from an old version of the SpreadSheet component. In the old version if I want to sum a range of cells, for example =SUM(A2:A1) the cell range remains like this.
In the new version if I do the same when I double click in the cell, the cell range change from =SUM(A2:A1) to =SUM(A1:A2)
How can I prevent this?
Thanks. 

For managing customers, I have a DxDataGrid set up with a popup editor. Some of the fields are lookup fields  and thus have their own data source.
For example there is a user data source  to declare the main user for each customer.
When editing a customer record, I need to let the user pick among declared users for this customer, that is to say, I have to filter  the users by customer ids.
With my current set up, when I try to pick up a user, I see all users.
My question : how to filter the lookup data source ? If this is not possible, what would be the best practice to solve this problem, creating a specific data source while preparing the editor ?
[EDIT]
I found the Cascading Lookup demos, it seems the correct way to do it. I tried replicate it with so far no success. I don't actually need the cascade mechanism, I need the lookup filtering approach. Here is what I did : 
In html component : 
In ts component : 
As shown in the demo, I also add in the component constructor the line : 
The lookup is working but strangely enough, the getFiltersUtilisateurs is never called. Any lead ?

I have a persistent class based on an existing database that doesn't show a selection column in the listview but I've been unable to determine why.
I've changed the DataAccessMode back to Client and removed all hidden actions but this had no effect. Do you have any suggestions.

Could you please allow duplicate document names when documents belong to different categories?
You should be able to do that beacuse table DocumentBase has Category information.
In the meanwhile can I modify the index iName_DocumentBase and relax this restriction ?
Thank you 

Hi,

Starting with version 
, the XAF Mobile authentication mechanism has been improved and uses an encrypted authentication cookie to store authentication information and transfer it through the network. This approach has the following advantages over the previously used Basic Authentication mechanism:
    - it allows us to achieve a higher security level.
    - its behavior can be adjusted according to your individual requirements.
Here are two examples of possible customization approaches to elaborate on the second statement:
 You can configure algorithms and keys to use for encryption using the 
 element in the application configuration file (Web.config). You can learn more about this in the following MSDN article: 
. 
NOTE
 Solution Wizard already adds the predefined configuration, that is intended to make your application scalable. With the default configuration, you will be able to take advantage of the 
 feature. This configuration is described in the Sharing Authentication Tickets Across Applications section of the 
 article. 
 To customize the authentication cookie's behavior, override the 
 method of the Mobile application's data service. For example, after setting the HttpCookie.Expires parameter, the current user will be redirected to the logon window after the specified period of inactivity:





The redirection will happen next time the user interacts with the application with a data request.
NOTE
After implementing this feature and deploying the new version to the server, users need to logoff to obtain a new cookie with the short expiration time.

steps to reproduce
1) open 
 in ie 11
2) click the SEARCH button
Check In, Check Out, Rooms editors have the wrong width. See attachment

Hi, I updated my operating system with the latest Windows updates this week, and the Toaster notifications which used to work perfectly, and not appearing anymore.
I don't getting any errors or warnings as far as I can see and even while stepping through the code everything seems fine.
 I'm not the only user here who is experiencing this after the updates. We were on DevExpress 16.2 before and have now upgraded to 17.2.5 but it did not make a difference. My colleague update his Windows first (while still on DevExpress 16.2) and I updated Dev Express to latest first, before installing the latest Windows updates and we both only experienced the Toaster Notification issue after the Windows Update.
I even tried to write a smaller piece of Toaster test code to see if  I can find an issue, but it behaves the same.
It there perhaps a fix or workaround that I can use to the the notifications to display?

Hi,
I'm need to setup the RichEditControls SimpleView.Padding  property in my project.
According to the documentation it is a System.Windows.Forms.Padding structure and the values are in pixels.
But the documentation does not precisely mention if these pixels are device independent or not.
In Wpf Padding properties usually are  System.Windows.Controls.Thickness structures with values in device  independent pixels (DIP in wpf 1/96 inch). 
Does the SimpleView.Padding property expect device dependent pixel units, so that I have to take into account a conversion if I have the source values in usual  WPF units (device independent pixels = 1/96inch)?
or
Does the SimpleView.Padding property already expected device independent pixels and I could omit a conversion on my own?
Thanks for clarification!
Best regards,
Stefan
Btw: The jumps from Wpf into WinForms are a little bit confusing but I can understand the reasons (according to 
)

Hi,
Today we found a issue with the fix point fromat of the number box widget. You can reproduce it with the demo on your homepage (Editors/Number box/Formatting).
Steps to reproduce:
1.) delete the default value (13,415.24)
2.) type 15 into the field
3.) leave the input field
4.) give the field the focus
5.) try to delete the value with backspace
Now you can on delete until the point the 15 is not possible with backspace.

Hello,
I'm looking to replace the dxSelectBox in my dxDataGrid as the selection process is too slow for my end users.  What they don't link is that it takes maybe a second to find the item in the select box prior to being able to tab out as selected.  Is there any way to make the dxSelectBox behave like a native select, such that it selects immediately as you type (all items pre-populated)?
If not, I've put together a simple sample of a native select box in the edit cell template and am having a problem with giving it focus when a user tabs in to the cell.  Could you tell me how I can send focus in?
Thank you!

I'm currently evaluating migration from PopupWindowShowAction to SimpleAction, since there is no way how to cancel opening popup window once PopupWindowShowAction is clicked (as described here: 
).
Once I migrated several actions I found out, there is a difference in ListView loading behavior. When popup window is opened from PopupWindowShowAction, this code works fine:
When the same code is called from Execute event of SimpleAction, objects are not loaded into respective ListView. Only empty ListView is shown. Nevertheless, if I use XPObjectSpace instead NestedObjectSpace, everything works fine even for SimpleAction.Executed event handler. 
What is the difference. Do I something wrong? Is this behavior by desing?
Thanks

Dear support,
we have a data import procedure that works by creating a new ObjectSpace, finding the correct objects, changing some property values and saving the result.
I found out that the AuditTrail does work in this use case, but only for non delayed property values. As soon as I change a property (e.g. for a String) to delayed the changes are not logged.
I found this thread: 
, but that implies that the AuditTrail does not work at all in my scenario. Just to make sure I tried out the code anyway, but it did not help.
When changing delayed property values in a detail view it does work though. Do you have an idea? Was this a bug maybe?
PS: I debugged the code a litte bit and found out that in the FullObjectAuditProcessor class, in "FillDiffsCore" the delayed property values seem to be not considered in my use case.
Thanks

i try to build a custom ToolTip for a row in a DataGrid based on some conditions.
Thats works very pretty but unfortunaly the tooltip for the first time is different to the tooltip for the second time.

Move it away
Move the mouse to the row again
We prefer the second one! How is it possible that the first one looks like as the others?

Hello
We have a strange issue on 1 productive server  with Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard.
Other 3 productive server s use Windows Server 2012 Standard
Development PCs have Windows 7 Professional
On development PCs, test and 3 productive servers, this problem doesn't exist:  
Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture and CurrentCulture  are set to de-AT right before using the report, but exported PDF shows that it was generated from default resx file.
To fix it, we reinstalled Windows on the server, upgraded DevExpress controls to 17.2.5 and it still doesn't take de-AT resources for the report.
What can be wrong on server or web site  ?

Hi guys,
I have a gridView that is updated frequently (1000 updates / minute). 
A lot of registers are inserted, delete and updated from it in any position.
My problem:
1) While the new registers are inserted in top of the list (news positions 0), the gridview is automatic scrolling the grid. In real, the gridview keeps the TopRow as the previous one, and not to the new one that has been recently added. I did a workaroud to assign the RowCountChanged to set the new TopRowIndex = 0 if the topRowIndex is different from 0 (code below):
private void grvBookBid_RowCountChanged(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
        {
            if (grvBookBid.TopRowIndex != 0)
            {
                grvBookBid.TopRowIndex = 0;
            }
        }
Although, it is not allowing to scroll the data as desire. While scrolling, if grid receive a item on Top position of grid, the gridview goes to the top of grid.
Is there a way to disable scrolling automatic behavior ? I'd like to scroll only manually, and keep the gridview in the same position as we are scrolling (independent of the parallel inserting content.
2) Is there a way to put the scroll in gridview only when the user is trying to scroll? If the grid is static,  is it possible to hide the scroll vert bar?

I'm trying to make sure when I display a Print Preview of an Xtra Report via the ShowRibbonPreviewDialog() method that it is ALWAYS maximized on the user's screen.  I'm using code similar to the following - but it does not work (uses the last screen size set by the user)
printTool = new ReportPrintTool(report);
printTool.PreviewRibbonForm.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized;
printTool.ShowRibbonPreviewDialog(UserLookAndFeel.Default);
can you help me to get this working???
Thanks!

Is there a threshold of how much you should user the Messenger functional within the WPF MVVM model?
Example: In .net application, if you have too much session data by using Session variables, then you can run into issues with memory etc. 

Hello,
I have an application that processes data from a database and uses xtrareports to present some of the process results to the user in the form of pdf files. The xtrareports are using templates made from the report designer in visual studio, so lets say that we deploy the application with ReportTemplate1 and ReportTemplate2, for producing DataReport1 and DataReport2.
Now after sometime we need to update the deployed application, in order to change the provided reports. Data are exactly the same so we only need to alter the templates, eg. modifying ReportTemplate2 to a new ReportTemplate2 and additionally adding ReportTemplate3 as a new template ,  
preferably without changing the installed executable, probably by changing an assembly or another data file that containg only the report templates.
It the above possible and how can this be implemented, please provide me with a sample project.
Thanks in advance for your time.

Hello,
I am using the map control for winforms and have started playing around with legends.
I have  found two issues that I have been unable to resolve by experimenting or by searching for ideas.
1. The legend display the same size regardless of the size of the map control so if the map is resized to be smaller the legend takes over the whole map.
2. It there are a large number of items in the legend it simply overflows the control.  We have had an idea to display only every n-th item but even for this we would need to know how many items could safely fit to be able to calculate n.  In many cases the legend could safely be smaller and fit in more items.

Dear Support Team,
I am using DevExtreme MVC DataGrid. I need to calculate column and show in the footer.
I have checked documentation and based on it did the changes. 
But it is not doing sum properly.
Below is the code used for summary:
you can see the attached image where sum is calculating wrong value.
One of my column having data decimal with percentage e.g: 2.70 %
When i applied sum for this column then total calculating sum showing zero.
Could you please suggest some solution for it?
Thanks,

Here is my scenario:
Other than some SQL contained in RDL (SSRS) reports I do not have any direct references to SecuritySystemUser, so that's not a big deal to take care of.
I have a custom class (User) derived from SecuritySystemUser
I do not wish to change Oid to string values on any references or associations to User so seems the CodeProject solution mostly deals with this.
Questions:
1. How do I handle in a single pass changing my User class to be derived from PermissionPolicyUser wihtout requiring a 2nd build version to be deployed after conversion?
2. What are other considerations of having a custom User class and trying to migrate in ModuleUpdater?
3. I would also like to copy the password, so it does look like part of the CodeProject example would be of benefit for copying just the user objects, especially since I want to preserve the existing Oid values for user objects (not necessarily for roles/permissions) as there are many objects that reference this.
Making some progress.  I was able to get User and SystemSecurityUser to convert to PermissionPolicyUser and handle all the references....
However, when it gets to the CopyUser loop, no objects are returned in ObjectSpace.GetObjects<SecuritySystemUser>() even though there is still data there.  I don't get any errors and looking at SQL profiler, nothing is hitting the database.




 


I even added this to my module constructor (although I don't believe it's needed)




So I can log in and I see that it's using the new PermissionPolicyUser object, but I have no roles or permissions

If the BackStageView of the ribbon contains a LayoutControl with TdxLayoutLabeledItems with CaptionOptions.WordWrap set to True there is a significant delay when the BackStageView is opened for the first time.
This is obviously a follow-up to ticket:
Attached is a sample project demonstrating the issue. 

I have a Gridview with 2 Custom bound Data Columns.  That's working great, but if I want to hide one of the columns on the grid, I start getting a JavaScript error on the other.
I thought I might be able to resolve the issue by checking to see if the control exists before doing the PerformCallback like this:
But I still get the following JavaScript Error Message:
This issue can be reproduced in the example provided in Ticket T601707.  Just hide the first column by Right clicking the column and hiding it.  When you try to edit the text area the JavaScript error occurs.  
To further illustrate my issue, I've updated and attached an example program.  If you hide the first column, the second column dropdown no longer works.  If you do it in reverse, the first column dropdown continues to work despite the APILock Error.
Please advise how I can prevent the issues caused when hiding a column.  Thanks!
 

Hi,

I'm seeing some issues when the ASP.NET FileManager control's root folder  is pointed to a directory that contains a very large number of files and folders -- the root of C:\, for example.  
In some cases it appears to hang or take an unacceptably long time to render in the client browser.  In other cases, I've gotten an Out of Memory error on the server side.     
We don't really intend the control to be used this way, but customers have a way of finding anything they can break.  
At a minimum, I'd like to be able to provide guidance to customers on a recommended maximum number of files/folders the FileManager control can be expected to handle without significant delay in rendering or other issues.   We may need to put some checking in place to count files and folders in the selected path before setting the FileManager's root -- better to show end users a friendly message that they're asking too much than have it hang or error.
Please provide some guidelines on a safe maximum number of files/folders the control can handle without issue.
Thanks,
Michael

Hello.
I'm having difficulty using 2 dx-date-box components, and making range rules between them.
Use devextreme with angular 5
There are two different situations. In the first, the user will inform a date in the first component, and in the second component he can only select the date within the month set in the first component.
In the second situation, the user will enter a date in the first component, and in the second it will only be able to choose a date in the same year selected in the first component.
I started to build something like this:
<div class = "dx-field">
      <div class = "dx-field-label"> Start Date </ div>
      <div class = "dx-field-value">
        <dx-date-box # start_date [(value)] = "currentDate"> </ dx-date-box>
      </ div>
    </ div>
    
    <div class = "dx-field">
      <div class = "dx-field-label"> Final Date </ div>
      <div class = "dx-field-value">
        <dx-date-box #data_fim [(max)] = "maxDate"> </ dx-date-box>
      </ div>
    </ div>
And in the component.ts:
currentDate = new Date ();
maxDate = new Date (this.currentDate.getFullYear (), this.currentDate.getMonth () + 1, 0);
At component startup, the maxDate method works by limiting the date of the second component to only access within the started month.
However, by changing the value of the first component, it changes the value of [(value)] = "currentDate" by doing the two-way data binding of the angle, but maxDate does not receive this updated value, and does not exchange maxDate.
Could you help me on how to do this range between 2 dx-date-box?
I know it has a date range own component, but the client I find confusing to the general public, so it has to be between 2 dx-date-box even. 


                                This example illustrates approaches to set the color of a time cell in a scheduler grouped by resource.
1. Each resource can have its own color specified by the 
 property. Uncomment two lines in the MainWindow's XAML to assign the resource color mapping, so that each resource obtains its color from the data source.
2. Use a custom resource brush schema. Create a 
 object in MainWindow's XAML resources and assign it to the  
 property.
3. Create a 
's data template, define a cell style and assign the style to the appropriate property of the desired view:
- Day view, Work-Week view, Week view - use the 
 and 
 properties;
- Month view - use the 
 property;
- Timeline view - use the 
 property.
The picture below demonstrates a custom cell style and template applied to the selected cells of the resource with ID=1.  A custom data template displays the time interval contained in the cell's data context.

                            

Hello,
I need to do following task in several classes:.
Load an CSV or XSLX File and keep an IWorkbook for a while as a (readonly) datasource to extract part of the data to DataTables:
Using the workbook after disposing the spreadsheetcontrol cases an Exception, that the workbook is invalid.
Is there a way to avoid the usage of the SpreadsheetControl (so do it without UI) ?
I saw, that one can use the Workbook class directly without UI control with an additiional document Server subscription.
Is this the only way or is there another "trick" ?
Thanks a lot in advance !

Dropping a Aspxhtmleditor onto a form as below (not code provided as it has the same issue regardless), when switching between the "Design" and "HTML" tabs, At first the Design tab is blank, switching to the HTML tab it shows
<html><head>
    <title>title</title>
  </head>
  <body></body></html>
switching back to the design tab still shows blank, switching back to the HTML tab again it now shows
<html><head>
    <title>title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    title
  
  
</body></html>
and then switching back to the design tab, it now shows the word title , switching back and forth any more make no further changes.
If you switch to the HTML tab an then change the HTML to :
<html>
  <body>
  </body></html>
and then switch back to design and then back to HTML, the html has changed to 
<html><head>
    <title>title</title>
  </head>
  <body></body></html>
a further switch back to Design and then HTML now gives
<html><head>
    <title>title</title>

Hi support; 
I have a  @Html.DevExpress().Dashboard(settings => { settings.Name = "Dashboard"; }) created in an ASP.NET MVC application. Within this Dashboard I've included a Gauge widget. Within the Chrome developer console I call Dashboard.SetVisible(false) via javascript, then Dashboard.SetVisible(true), and each time a gauge disappears. Please see attached screenshot. 
In the Chrome console an error is thrown: dxCircularGauge incident occurred. Code: W2103  DXR.axd?r=1 228.1 22.., 15 12-vzBcg:120867
Please advise.

I'm trying to get selection similar to an HTML table. I switched from a GridControl to RichEditControl for the HTMLText attribute, but I am still not getting HTML Table behavior.
Is there a property in the RichEditControl that will help with this? Attached video will clarify.
In HTML Tables, You can partially select text from multiple cells. However, in a RichEditControl with HTMLText, it will only select a full row once you leave the original cell.
Is it possible to get the HTML Table behavior in a RichEditControl? I'm hoping it's just a simple property somewhere that I can't find. 

I am encountering a problem with the BinaryImage control and submitting an image to the database.  On a basic level, the application that we have boils down to a view with a basic BinaryImage control and the controller code to handle the data.  In our working code, we have the same form but it has multiple textboxes, combo boxes and other controls.  When the BinaryImage is selected, the CallbackRoutValues controller route is triggered, however at that point we can't store the image because the rest of the form has to be completed.  The problem occurs when the full form is submitted with all of the data, from all of the controls.  On the full submission, the BinaryImage control always returns a null value with no data.  The simplified view is below without the other textboxes and other data.  I have researched through as many of the questions as I can find and none of the solutions fixes my current problem.  Why is the full form submission occurring with the image data always null?  How can I get the image to submit with the full form?
Thanks,

I have a simple app to learn making mvvm custom dialogs. I am having trouble passing a parameter to my child viewmodel using a ctor.
I have tried different configurations of code but can't get rid of a null reference exception.
My parent viewmodel looks like this:
  My dialog child viewmodel looks like this:
When I type in the textedit in the options dialog the app crashes having MyOptions = null. But the Create method makes a default  non null instance.
What is wrong with my structure?

I'm trying to replicate the behavior of a .NET DataGridView when EditMode is set to EditOnEnter. I've tried the various OptionsBehavior.EditorShowMode values, but none of them gives me what I need. When set to EditOnEnter, the .NET DataGridView lets me either drag across multiple cells to select them or edit a value immediately when I click a single cell. 
But the EditorShowMode that lets me a edit a value as soon as I click it (EditorShowMode.MouseDown) prevents me from dragging across multiple cells to select them. I can get it to do either of the DataGridView's behaviors but not both.
For example, I'd like users to be able to change the value of a single checkbox with one click or drag across a range of checkboxes and change them all by clicking a button.
I suspect I'm missing another option that has to be set along with the EditorShowMode, but I can't figure out what it is. 
The current workaround I'm using is to simply change the checkbox value when the editor is shown...
Private Sub CustomXtraGridView_ShownEditor(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Me.ShownEditor
        If Me.OptionsBehavior.EditorShowMode = DevExpress.Utils.EditorShowMode.MouseUp Then
            If TypeOf Me.ActiveEditor Is DevExpress.XtraEditors.CheckEdit Then
                Me.SetRowCellValue(Me.FocusedRowHandle, Me.FocusedColumn, Not Me.GetRowCellValue(Me.FocusedRowHandle, Me.FocusedColumn))
            End If
        End If
End Sub

I have a grid control with a banded grid view with several button edit controls in several columns. I want to disable the buttons on all the repository button edit controls in the row including the one i clicked except for one that i can click and re-enable them back. I'm trying to do this on the repositoryItemButtonEdit_ButtonClick event. If I use repositoryItemButton1.Buttons[0].Enabled = true, it disables the button in all the rows. I just want it to do that for that row i'm on, not the rest. Is there a way to get the repositoryItemButtonEdit's in the row i am on within the button click event?

We have a descendant of RepositoryItemGridLookUpEdit (and GridLookUpEdit).  This has worked well for several version of your product.  After updating to 17.2.5 we are receiving a NullReferenceException on a line that sets the ActiveFilterCriteria of the gridview.
view.ActiveFilterCriteria = new BinaryOperator("ValidEntry", true, BinaryOperatorType.Equal);
this works fine in all previous versions.
I've attached a cut back sample project  to demonstrate the issue.
Thanks,

Hello, we are currently looking to implement a feature that would limit the number of dashboard elements(widgets) that a user can have per dashboard. In doing this I have been using the DashboardItemControlCreated event, and if adding another widget would exceed the maximum number we have set stop the creation of the new element, and show the user a message explaining what happened. The way I thought at first to do this was to simply dispose of the element that is being added, however this doesn't seem to work.
The code that I am using is below.
However, the item is still created. I suspect that this is because that item hasn't been added in yet and thus can't yet be disposed? Regardless, if there is any help as to the proper way of preforming this task I would be very appreciative in any advice that can be given.
 

I have recently started using the XpoDefault.OptimisticLockingReadBehavior = OptimisticLockingReadBehavior.MergeCollisionThrowException option in my application, and for the most part, it seems to work great. However, I have had a number of instances recently of users claiming they get the warning dialog without the 'Merge' option (implying another user modified the same field), even though they are absolutely certain this is not the case.
Is there a way to obtain a list of the fields  that collided, thereby blocking the merge option?
Thank you 

Hello,
I came across to some strange behavior with the MVVM framework under specific circumstances that I can't really describe :-) 
Please see attached sample and notice that the PropertyChangedEvent for the SelecedPerson property is fired twice and that  it's value does not correspond to selected person in the grid.
If you remove either the trigger or the binding, it seems to work.

I am working with the PivotCustomizationExtension and the only way I have been able to get it to work is by using the Splitter widget to render both the CustomizationExtension and PivotGrid together on one page. But when I use the settings.FullscreenMode = true it locks the page down and I am unable to horizontally or vertically scroll throughout the page itself. Within the splitter the  PivotGrid side allows for scrolling but the CustomizationExtension does not allow the user to scroll down. Here is the code for the splitter:
 How can I use the fullscreen mode and still allow the user to scroll within the page?
Thanks

Hello,
We have 1 "main" splitter with 2 panes. The second pane of the "main" splitter contains a div with relative position and a "minor" splitter with 2 other panes. The second pane of the "minor" splitter contains a other div with relative position and a FormLayout with DateEdit. 
I have remove the relative position attribute of the second pane of the "minor" splitter. Now the calendar isn't truncate in the left part but always in the right part. See file in attachment. 
It's not possible to remove the relative position attribute of the div in the second pane of the "main" splitter without change a big part of our application. 
What can I do?

Hello,
I did some tests with RolesMergingMode in security system and found one thing that I don't fully understand.
Let's say I want to allow members of one group read access to Person table,
but I also want to prevent members of second role read access to Name property of Person type.
I have RolesMergingMode set to GrantedInAnyRole and created 2 roles:
- Role1 - allow read access to Person Type, Permission policy set to deny all by default
- Role2 - Permission policy set to Deny all by default, No Person Type permissions, but deny on FirstName and LastName members
User 'usr1' is member of both roles.
According to ilustration in the bottom of 
 page,
I would expect that member permissions configured in Role2 would take priority over the ones in Role1, but they don't.
Please could you explain me what is expected behavior in this case?
Thank you

I have successfully built a group of pivot grids that utilize the settings.PreRender event to add field.FilterValues that are used to filter out everything I dont want appearing on the Pivot Grid itself. These setting work perfectly with a standalone PivotGrid. But once I was forced to use your PivotCustomizationExtension the filtering is not being applied anymore and when using the PivotGrid it just hangs on loading when I drag a filter into the column area or row area. Here is the code for the PivotGridSettings that are used for both the PivotGrid and PivotCustomizationExtension :
 
Everrything loads properly onto the pivot grid and the preset filters and Measures appear in the correct locations on the PivotCustomizationExtension but once anything is dragged to one of the other parts the entire grids is stuck on loading. Plus the numbers that are initially shown on the PivotGrid are incorrect they are showing all data rather than the filtered data. All of these settings work fine for the standalone PivotGrid it is only once I implemented the PivotCustomizationExtension that this error occurred.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

                                e.Info.SuperTip.Items.Add(gridImageItem)
End If
My routine picks up the proper font off the ToolTipItem, but the antialiasing of the text I draw is different than what the DevExpress tooltips draw (see attached  text_rendering_different.png)
I've attached a fully functional demo project also. - TooltipTextRenderingIssue.zip
In my routine buildGridImageOfData I do all this:
     Using g As Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(myBitmap)
            g.SmoothingMode = SmoothingMode.HighQuality
            g.InterpolationMode = InterpolationMode.HighQualityBilinear
            g.PixelOffsetMode = PixelOffsetMode.HighQuality
            g.TextRenderingHint = System.Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint.AntiAliasGridFit
But it just doesn't match. I've tried many permutations and cannot find it.
Could you modify my demo project to get the texts to match pls?
 

Our customers security settings prevent font files from being downloaded in IE 11. This is a policy that cannot change. As such we must come up with a workaround for the icons in Dev Express since they do not display. Do you have any recommendations for replacing the current dxicons font files with an alternative solution?

Hi,
I tried to hide the following menus:
 e.Menu.RemoveMenuItem(RichEditCommandId.NewComment);
 e.Menu.RemoveMenuItem(RichEditCommandId.NextComment);
It didn't work, so I figure out that the ID's are not matching which are in the Menu list.
 RichEditCommandId.NewComment value is 335
 RichEditCommandId.NextComment value is 341
But when I use these numbers than it works:
e.Menu.RemoveMenuItem(new RichEditCommandId(359));
e.Menu.RemoveMenuItem(new RichEditCommandId(360));
Am I correct or do I something wrong?
Tx,

Hi,
I have a GridView that is in batch edit mode.  I'm trying to set up all the event handlers from JavaScript instead of in the Razor page.  I have it all working except for setting ValueChanged on the edit text box.  On the server side, I would do this:
But when I instead try to set this on the client-side in the  MVCxClientGlobalEvents.AddControlsInitializedEventHandler event, it doesn't seem to work.  The event is not fired when I change the value in the column.
Thanks for the help.

I'm wondering how it would be possible to update a partial view from a gridview call back? In the attached screen shot I have 2 partial views on a form. When I save partial view A, I would like it to update partial view B. When partial view A is submitted, it runs through the List of Errors on partial view B. If the errors are corrected, then they are removed from the list, but if all the errors are not corrected, I would like to show the updated list - how can I do this? The 2 partial views are loaded onto a view in popup with an Ajax form (attached code)
thank you

Hello,
I am setting up a new theme using the ThemeBuilder and was successful at applying my theme. I think I followed all of the examples at:
However, when I try to switch to one of the built-in themes, nothing happens.
In my MainWindow() When I comment out
The theme drop down works and switches themes.  However, when I try to set my theme with the ThemeManager, it seems to break the built in themes.  When I use the ApplicationThemeHelper.ApplicationThemeName = "My Custom Theme" it seems to work.
Is this by-design, should I not use the ThemeManager.SetTheme() ?
 
Please advise.
Thanks much,

I am using the report builder tool. 
Sometime when I programmaticly request a report to be generated it  turns out that the person for whom the report was generated didn't have any data, so they get lines and column headers but no data and it doesn't look very good. (I cant capture for that in advance.)
My question: Is there a way to place a label after the report title that says "No data for this person"  and suppress the rest of the report from printing.
Thanks

I have configured a data grid to use Popup editing mode, and assigned a editCellTemplate to the only column on the grid that is editable.
The popup does not popup, but instead, it is displayed at the bottom of the page where the popup widget is declared, and I get this error :
Adapter for DevExpressValidator component cannot be configured .
Neither my data , nor my popup content uses any validator or validation  of any kind.
Please see the attached screen shots of the page and the error.  Also attached is my view.
 

Hi,
the async server list implementation seems to have an internal refresh problem. 
I am able to reproduce this problem in the "DataGrid Entity Framework" Demo (as you can see in video, which is located in the zip file).
I have also attached a simple demo in which it is easier to reproduce this issue.
- Start the Application
- Enter 1244 in the AutoFilter Row of the column "Key".
- Mark the string  1244 in the AutoFilter Row and remove it with ctrl+x.
- Scroll to the end of the list
- Ctrl+v in the auto filter  column "Key" => Wrong Data
- When you now move the mouse cursor over the Key Column Header, the grid refresh the data and the correct data is shown (you can see this behavior in the video too).
Enable AllowScrollAnimation seems to work as a temporary workaround, but I'm not sure how good this really works.
Kind regards,
Jonathan Wilhelm

I am trying to add a button to clear the selected value of LookupEdit control.  I added a button to the Buttons collection and added code to clear the EditValue and it is working correctly.  However, I'm trying to hide the button if there is no selected value and it is causing the control to behave strangely.  It seems that the drop down is opening and then immediately closing upon each key stroke.
I am trying to use the EditValueChanged event to trigger the showing/hiding of the button.  Perhaps there is a better way that you can suggest. 
My event handlers look like this: 
    Private Sub lookupManualSetup_ButtonClick(sender As Object, e As DevExpress.XtraEditors.Controls.ButtonPressedEventArgs) Handles lookupManualSetup.ButtonClick
        If e.Button.Kind = DevExpress.XtraEditors.Controls.ButtonPredefines.Clear Then
            Me.lookupManualSetup.EditValue = Nothing
        End If
    End Sub
    Private Sub lookupManualSetup_EditValueChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles lookupManualSetup.EditValueChanged
        Dim isVisible As Boolean = lookupManualSetup.ItemIndex > -1
        If Me.lookupManualSetup.Properties.Buttons(0).Visible <> isVisible Then
            Me.lookupManualSetup.Properties.Buttons(0).Visible = isVisible
        End If
    End Sub
As I mentioned, the button click event works fine.  The other event works fine if I open the drop-down and then click an item in the list.  But if I try to type, the autocomplete is not working normally.
Thanks,
Scott 

Hi, a question about MVVM WinForm framework.
I've a viewmodel with 8 properties, all this properties are bound to a gridcontrol on view.
Reading this 
 we have add 
on our grid.
The check box in not bound to a property model, see enclosed screen shot.
How could we add new button to this form in order to iterate on all the entity bound to gridcontrol and check if 
 is selected on gridcontrol.
Remember check box it's not bound to model.
Thank you in advance.

Hi, 
I have a serious problem, I'm working with fields calculated in version 1.7.9, but I had a problem when I was working on version 1.4, the calculated fields worked very well, but now with this version they do not work for me, it generates an error, 
There is a difference between one version and another.  Thanks for your support 

The dxDataGrid function getSelectedRowKeys() will not return the accurate keys if a row has been selected and re-selected a few times. 
To duplicate this bug:
Create a dxDataGrid : 
Note this function is also used to generate a property of obj called selectedRowKeys when using the onSelectionChanged, like in this example.
Select multiple rows, then select and deselect the same row a few times.
The console logs will show that the row keys in the selectedRowKeys array is being overridden.
The keys do not correspond with the actual keys, which can be seen in obj.selectedRowData.realKey.

Hi,

Hello,
I've been looking up this issue in your previous support tickets, but they all seem old and provide solutions that don't quite resolve my issue.
I have a GridControl where some entries contain DetailDescriptors which, themselves, are two additional GridControls.  All of this data is being updated frequently, and the selection (which is shared among the parent GridControl and all child GridControls) is changing rapidly.  I have a PropertyGrid and a RibbonControl with context-specific controls, so you can imagine the annoyance of being unable to maintain a selection for very long.
How do I preserve the selection when the source collection is updated? The ViewModel's collection is bound to another collection that is global for the application, so the ViewModel doesn't really know when the updates are going to occur.  This seems to eliminate the solution of resetting the selection after every update (which I find hacky, anyway).  I believe I've found that the WinForms controls have a "PreserveFocusOnDataUpdate" property, so I would expect a similar property in WPF.
What do you suggest?
Thanks,
CK 

I am embedding a grid inside a mastergrid. I am dynamically showing new grid data depending on the selection in the master grid. The code i have copied is from 
 .
My final step is to dynamically configure the data source for the grid , but i am having a lot of difficulty understanding how to configure it without the use of a controller. I am employing the code behind a razor page exclusively. 
The challenge i'm facing is to select the specific instance of List<SegmentLeaderboard > in the masterdetails.
datamodels are below (attaching the razor page)
    public class SegmentLeaderboard
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Type { get; set; }
        public string World { get; set; }
        public List<Activity> Activity { get; set; }
        //TODO: add foreign key to Event
    }
}
    public class Activity
    {
        //activity members
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public DateTime Start_date { get; set; }
        public int Achievement_count { get; set; }
        public int Comment_count { get; set; }
        public int Kudos_count { get; set; }
        public Boolean Flagged { get; set; }
        //reference members
        public Athlete Athlete { get; set; }
        //public int EventID { get; set; }
    }

Hello,
Is there a way to remove trailing zeros on values displayed on the grid?
I am using this configuration
column.dataType = "number";
column.format = { type: "fixedPoint", precision: 1 };
column.editorOptions = { format: "#0.#" }
Value rounding is working correctly, for example,  18.199 is displayed as 18.2
In a another case, when the value is 18, I would like to show the value without the trailing zero as 18 instead of 18.0
Thanks for your support!

Hi DevExpress Support,
      I have a scenario where I have a devextreme form and inside of that form is a text field, that text field needs to be unique when the form is submitted that's why there's a server side check that needs to happen, what I want is instead of waiting for the form to be submitted, I want server side validation to kick in real time while the user is typing on the text editor in the form so that every time the user types, a validation is being made and lets the user know if the value that is typed in the editor is unique or not.
      My initial approach is to have a method in the view model that does the server side checking and this method is the one that should be called inside of the event, I just need to handle the event where the text editor's value is being changed.
      Do you think this approach is ok ? or do you have a different suggestion or idea ?
      Can you provide an example ? :) 
Thanks!
Jude Alquiza. 

hi
I want to create a reporting system where user can login to create/ update / make attachments / register new item and put a note to a product.  
I prefer to use dev extreme approach as it is much more user friendly with mobile and tablet interfaces.
it would be very helpful if you can provide me some sample base project that i can start with.
Thank you  
 

I am trying to push elements in the form only if they does not exist.
F?ormItems.Push should work only if the particular element does not exist in the form.
I know that we can check using for loop in form items but then every time when form initialize it will work with foreach loop.
So is there some other way like exist function which will check fast. 

Hi.  I have a GridView control on a view and there are links to additional views.  Is there any way to save the filtering and sorting so that when the user returns to the GirdView view, I can re-apply the filtering and sortings?

Hello Dev Express,
I am trying to utilize your FileUploadControl extension in a way that allows the user to simply drag and drop their file into the File Upload Control space.  When I drag a file into the boundary of the control, the system shows a progress bar which makes it appear that the upload occurs, but then a "Not Found" is displayed in red once the progress bar completes.
Here are the settings that I am using with the extension.  Am I missing something here, or is there something that I need to account for with the callback routine in order to capture the file? 
@using (Html.BeginForm("GeneologyFileUploadControlUpload", "Home", FormMethod.Post))
        {
            @Html.DevExpress().UploadControl(settings =>
       {
           settings.Name = "GeneologyFileUploadControl";
           settings.CallbackRouteValues = new { Controller = "Home", Action = "GeneologyFileUploadControlUpload" };
           settings.AdvancedModeSettings.EnableDragAndDrop = true;
           settings.ShowUploadButton = true;
           settings.ShowProgressPanel = true;
           settings.ValidationSettings.AllowedFileExtensions = new string[] { ".csv", ".pdf", ".xlsx" };
           settings.AutoStartUpload = true;
          
           
           //OnFileUploadComplete="UploadControl_FileUploadComplete"
           settings.ValidationSettings.Assign(AmbassadorDashboard.Controllers.HomeControllerGeneologyFileUploadControlSettings.UploadValidationSettings);
       }).GetHtml()
        }

There are RowsRemoving events in the 17.2 version, but there is no event in 15.2. What should I do if I want to get the event before the line is deleted?

I am using 17.2.5 and "Add DevExpress Item" menu item in the right click menu of solution explorer is disabled. 
I have tried repairing installation, and even uninstalling and installing again, but the problem persists. This happens even on a brand new XAF project created with the Template Gallery.
Note that this seems to affect all projects (not only XAF). Even in a ASP.NET MVC 5 web app this item is disabled. For these project the only DX menu item that works is "Add DevExtreme to project".

Hello,
I need to  group Date-time values. I know, how I can do that (thanks 
).
But I have 2 date-time values. The example on the attached image.
There are two date: employes' Date of Hired (datHire) and Date of Fired  (datFire). And there are two fields (hired and fired), that takes two values: 1 or 0. 1 is mean, that datHire (or datFire) is between two dates (the user enters them himself).
For examlpe, the user enter these date s (01.01.2017 and 31.12.2017). The SQL-result is on the attached image (The first table) . And What I need to receive as result too (the second table).
How can I to combaine 2 date in one?

Could you please provide an example of how to build a VGrid dynamically in code? That looks similar to the one in the video?
Regards,


Thank you!
And as a quick follow up:
Is there a way I can entirely replace the string that appears as the caption for that cell? The URLs are longer than the cell is wide, so I would like to replace what is displayed with custom text.
Currently the best I can do is prepend/append to the field by using 
    properties.TextFormatString = "foo {0}";
Whereas
properties.TextFormatString = "User's profile";
does not work.

Hi, I have a GridView that is bound to a dataset which is populated at runtime. I would like to add an unbound column to this that an user can enter some information into. When they hit a submit button on the form, I would like to traverse the rows and perform actions based on the entered values. (e.g. box contains QTY to time to copy the row)
I have added an unbound column, but the data I enter isn't being saved when I change the row., which I can see is due to being an unbound column. Do you have any suggestion on how to achieve my goal?

Good morning, i am trying to make a report and print it or preview it from a form.. 
in the report i have a sqlDataSource, a parameter and i have filter the datasource with parameter1(=[Parameters.applicant_id]) and i have manage the query where `column` = @Parameter1
in the form i have write this:
the problem is that when i run the form and call the report in a button_Click the app is too slow and i wait about 20 seconds. i wait about 6-8 seconds to load the please wait screen (the first image in the attachment) and (when i preview it) 10-12 seconds to load the screen before (the second image in the attachement). 
If i make another query in a smaller datasource i wait only about 6-8 seconds about the wait screen..
i want to know if i can do anything to improve this waiting time or if i have made something wrong..

Hello,
I would like to allow a user to copy all values of a single column for all selected rows to the clipboard. Basically, the gridview displays contact information, and I would like the user to be able to select as many rows as they would like with the command column check box, and then copy all selected values of a single column (email address) to their clipboard. Would this be possible?
Thanks! 

I was update my DevExpress components from v. 13.2 to 17.2.
In old version I used WebWindowTemplateHttpHandler,

Currently, the EndDate value is calculated automatically based on the StartDate value only when the DateEditRangeSettings.MinDayCount property is greater than 0.

The linechart in my project will be updated every  10 seconds with a new value, that "problem" I solved already. But now I want the chart setup with the follwing, is that posible?
Is it posible to make the line chart always shows the last 15minutes? And for example scroll to show the earlier values/points
Is it posible to have always the same distance "on the chart" between two values/points? Now the distance is being reduced when a value/point is added to the chart. I also want to start the chart with the first point on the left.
An example of my project you can find here:

Hi
I'm moving an application with a 17.1 Scheduler to version 17.2.5. The appointments, labels, statuses and resources are loaded from a SQL Server DB. Labels, Resources  and Statuses have customized colors that are also loaded from the DB.
It all worked fine in 17.1, but now I cannot find the way to show appointments grouped  by Resource. In fact, the appointments created for the Resource #2 do not show in the Scheduler until I uncheck grouping in the scheduler (in runtime, cliicking the ribbon button). 
This is the first problem, but I have another one and I do not know if it is related to the first (either as a cause or effect...). The second problem is that I cannot load the colors for Resources and Statuses. Colors and captions  for Labels are loaded well and they show in the Scheduler, but for Resources and Status I can only load Captions, not colors. I'm using converters to load the colors, and I have tried both an IntegerToColorConverter and a IntegerToBrushConverter, and neither of them work.
I'm sending you three files. Two of them are screen captures of both the legacy version and the in progress 17.2.5 version, accessing to the same DB and the same day (please note that I'm using Catalan and all resources are in that language).
The third file is a test program that I'm using to create the migration. You can see there the XAML that I'm using and also the VB.NET code involved - not much indeed. All three files are in a zip.
Thank you in advance, 
Jesus
 

Hi,
I use tile controls contained into a Windows UI view managed by a DocumentManger   (DevExpress.XtraBars.Docking2010....). The same scenario of the  tiles demo you have provided in Tiles example  of Demo Center ( see the attached picture).
I want to save the layout of tiles. I add to your solution this event (EndItemDragging) handler on tile container:
private void StartGroup_EndItemDragging(object sender, TileItemDragEventArgs e)
        {
           this.BeginInvoke(new MethodInvoker(delegate {
                this.windowsUIView.SaveLayoutToXml(Path.Combine(userSettingsPath, Path.GetFileName(String.Concat(LayoutFileName, "WindowsUI.xml"))));
                this.tileContainer.SaveLayoutToXml(Path.Combine(userSettingsPath, Path.GetFileName(String.Concat(LayoutFileName, "Tile.xml"))));
            }));
        }
 
It seems to work properly. Do I call the SaveLayoutToXml functions on the correct controls?
I want to save also layout after element resize and all possible layout modifications of tiles. Please, could you show me which are the events to handle?
Thanks,
David 

Hi, I have a form with a grid.
I want to make it so that when user change values in the rows, it automatically saves their changes (by running a sql command to update the database)
Is the best place to do this on the  GridControl LostFocus event?
If so how d o I capture the text cell I am leaving?
GridView1.GetRowCellValue(GridView1.FocusedRowHandle, "Description")
Picks up the cell which is clicked on
Many Thanks 

Hi,
Using Angular 2.x Approach Component Framework.
I have an interesting issue with dxDateBox component . Some of years shows incorrect month name. 
For  example, when i select 2016 and February, it shows January on the title but the numbers of mount belong to February indeed. (First gif shows). Also when i click next mounth button it is passing April, it means there is no March but again the numbers of mount  belong to March. (Second gif shows). Interesting point is this situation occurs not for all years. For example 2017 is correct but 2016 is incorrect (thirth gif shows.)
Actually i have checked your demo and there is no this issue there. also i downloaded your 
 to my local and run. There is no this issue again. I have wanted to ask maybe you have an idea which situation causes of this behaviour. (packages in my app, cldr  or anything else etc.)
i have attached some screen capture gifs for clarity .
Thanks. 

Hello,
How do I read checkboxes and option buttons from excel?
See example excel file in debug folder.

How do I remove the "..." and have it show the proper value?

Hello, is there any news about realization? I use expressions for creating custom nonpersistent fields. Now I'm using simple string editor, but expression editor with mathematical, string and other function would be very useful.

Hello there.
For the past few days I have been attempting to create something like a 
 using your DevExtreme control.
I have had some degree of success, but of course I don't know the internal of how your existing Dashboard controls work and so I think it is quite  possible for you to create a Dashboard control.
 How I have done it is by parsing the XML exported by the WinForm Dashboard into C# objects that are then returned by a Web API controller and rendered on the client side using your DevExtreme Chart, Gauge and Grid controls.
There are basically two parts to your Dasboard XML. 1) The Data Source and queries 2) The items (Chart, Gauges etc)
I've created a service that performs the queries using the connection detail that are in the XML file and then create the item definition which are put into an object graph returned by the Web API controller.
On the client side I have TypeScript services that loop round the returned JSON and creates and configures your controls accordingly. 
I have read posts asking for a Dasboard control 
.
My web app is Angular 2, it is also deployed as a Android and  iOS app, so I need a complete separation of concerns.
So in order to create a Dasboard control you would need: 1) A DashboardSevice nuGet package that would create the object graph needed by Web API. 2) A Dashboard JavaScript control that would create the charts, gauges etc as per the definitions.
Would you be able to create something like this in the future?
Thanks,
Luke 

In my grid I have columns that are bound to SQL Server DateTime columns but I am only concerned with the time part and use the RepositoryItemTimeEdit as their column editor. However, the excel style drop down shows options for dates and nothing for times.
Is there any way to configure this to display something suitable for times?  Ideally be able to specify a time range (i.e. 09:00 to 12:00).

Hi
I am trying to build a Gridview control to update a database table that contains a foreign key Id. In order to update that Id I would like to have a combo box that is populated from the foreign key table.
The source table (tblbranches) in this example contains our branch data in the structure branchid (int), branchname (varchar(50)) and documentid (int). branchid is the primary key and documentid is the foreign key. The foreign key table (tbldocuments) contains 2 columns documentId (int) and documentname (varchar(50)) with documentid being the primary key.
The gridview has the datasource set to tblbranches and displays the 3 columns. However rather than displaying the documentid I would like to display the document name using a combobox  from the foreign key table.
How would I achieve this?
Thanks

Today I come with a suggestion, which I hope will find an echo.
When we're working on MDI-like applications, we often use ribbons and status bars. But unlike the rubban, the status bar has no "page" to simulate the concept of content partition. It  is therefore up to the developer to value the MergeOrder property  according to each level of depth (to represent the nesting of Russian  dolls to well imagine the situation of nested control users) so that  this information is presented in order A-> by the left, and the order ZA by the right.
In  my personal case, which I believe widespread, I have voluntarily  created this notion of "basic component equipped with menu" (ribbon  & status bar) as "basic component" for construction for the  realization of all my user controls. Thus, each of these presentation layer, embarks with him his part of menu, which segment at best the development. And today I see what I quote above. Short. The successive status bar merge, calls for special management of the MergeOrder property of the baritems that compose it.
Which begs the question about how a ribbonstatusbar mergeorder should be done ...
So I suggest to devexpress:
-  either to support a logic identical to the one I describe on the  menu-based components (which would standardize and therefore certainly  facilitate the work of thousands of customers :-)),
-  or simply support for a special ribbonstatusbar event, for the  definition (or overdefinition) of a global MergeOrder at barItems or a  MergeOrder status bar.
I join a powerpoint file to illustrate the point. 

Hi, DevExpress Team!
 
 I'm using XAF Web Application for a while.
 
 I need to create document for print from template (rtf) with SimpleAction. For this I'm using RichEditDocumentServer:
Since Web App is used, it's not possible to launch the document directly on the client (System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(path);).
Could you please adwise what is the best way to launch or print the document ?
I suppose there are two ways:
1. To create AspxRichEdit PropertyEditor, to add protperty EditorAlias("RTF") to my class and to save my document's data into the protperty:
 
 The only example to create RichEdit PropertyEditor I found  is made for win app, but not for web (
). So, how can I do it for Web ?
2. To create WebRichEditUserControl.ascx, called it when the document is created and then open the document in it.
How can I open WebRichEditUserControl.ascx from code and to input parametrs in to WebRichEditUserControl.ascx (path to the document file) ?
That do you think ? Can you advise somthing else ?



From the animation, looks like the graph will be displayed vertically. Is there a way to arrange them based on some autoflow responsive way? 

Hello support team,
Is there a way to do the tab ordering programatically? I don't use the designer to set up my views.
Thank you.

Goo morning, 
I am developing my application using XAF. In my web application I am currently creating a custom view with two separate Custom Controls (An ASPxTreeList and an ASPxGridView) that interact between each other. to do this I am tapping into various clientside events, in this case the NodeClick event that calls a custom JS function.
In this function I need to perform two main things:
1. Get the data from a hidden column of the clicked node.
2. Change the focused row and scroll to said row in the grid.
In the function I created to get the data I am facing an issue I tried to use the "GetNodeValues" function but the browser console is throwing the following error: Object doesn't support property or method 'GetNodeValues'. Bellow is an extract of my code to better understand.
Also, I am having trouble figuring out how to access the FocusedRowIndex and ScrollToVisibleIndexOnClient properties of the ASPxGridView on the NodeClick callback function. Bellow the markup of my ASPxGridView:
Thanks, 
Pablo.

I use this example:
My date boxes 
also i have one select box

Hi,
 I have a CardView with custom cards/item layout. I also have the SearchPanel enabled so cards can be filtered. This worked well with v16.1.x, but since I upgraded to v17.2.5 the search panel does not work anymore. A callback is made, but I get the same results back as if I wouldn't have started a search.
Attached is a sample project to show the issue. Two CardViews, one with default cards (search works), one with a custom template (search not working). Otherwise no differences.
Do I need to add some special settings which weren't needed before?

Hi,
Paste operation in WinForms GridView is not behaving correctly, when a cell block is copy-pasted from Excel to the grid and the block selected in Excel does not start from the first column. The data does not end up in the region which starts from the focuced cell, as indicated in documentation, but it is skewed rightwards as many columns as there are non-selected columns in Excel source.
According to this:
"Update - The pasted data updates the rectangular cell block whose upper left corner is the currently focused cell. Cells in the columns to the left of the focused column are not updated."
See the attached project for example.

Hi.
I have a customer viewing some pdf files in a winforms application we developed for them.
Some pdf displays incorrectly and we have found that in acrobat reader DC the option overprint preview must be selected to the pdf to display correctly.
I havent found this option in the documentation nor in the code, is the any way to activate it? is it supported in the actual version? 

I have data which represents counts per cohort per hour of the day.
The hour of the day is just represented in the data as a number from 0-23.
I have successfully modified the axis label, using 
chartOptions.argumentAxis.label.customiseText to return my required string, and configuring it inside onWidgetCreated.
In addition, I want to format the tooltip heading on the chart to display the hour the same way....
See the attached image.
Examples I have found indicate how to format a series value, but that isn't what I want to change - all the series display fine in the tooltip.
How can I modify just the "x-axis heading" part of the tooltip?

Hi.
We're using DashboardViewerExtension in our analytics portal. There's quite an amount of custom stuff there, UI for selection of dashboards, XML in database, filtering queries on certain dashboards etc. 
Now since DashboardViewer is now obsolete, I'm trying to replace it with DashboardExtension and I'd like to know what's the best approach.
- we want to let the user pick a dashboard using our custom controls
- we sometimes need to modify queries on the run
- our users are able to save (most) filters using our custom functions, but if there was an embedded UI for saving filters in localstorage, we'd probably use it 
I've seen most of the walthroughs and answers available on this topic and I just need to make sure I'm not missing anything. 
I'll start with this question:
Is it possible to bind the DashboardLoading and similar events using DashboardExtension in Razor, when I cannot pass DashboardSourceModel anymore? How? Or what alternatives are there, when we want to keep handling stuff?
Thanks for any answers/pointers.

Hi
I have a XtraReport file with a xrBarCo ntrol. I assigned a sqldatasource to run a SQL SP with a single parameter, that is passed from other aspx page.I handle the BeforePrint method for the xrBarControl (QR code).
Always returns null. So I use GetCurrentRow(), which the VS watch shows a SQL ResultSet with the data I want, although type is object and data is not a row. And I cannot get data from GetCurrentColumnValue() which get's always null.
I cast it as DataRowView as documentation and other solutions, and value is null. Also I tried other type like DataSet, DataView without sucess.

Hello
I have a SchedulerControl connected to a ResourceTree and a SchedulerStorage.
My goal is to create a team/employee hierarchy in the ResourceTree with resources. 
An employee can be included in several teams and therefore the resource-ID will not be unique in the tree.
I can create this but it doesn't work fully. If I drag an appointment to a duplicate resource, it first looks like it's working and the appointment appears on all resource rows, but when I release the mousebutton it will only stay at the last resource.
It is possible to have the same ID on several resources or is it not supported?

Hello!
 I got pretty far in what I am trying to accomplish, but there are still some issues left that I am having troubles with.
It's concerning the appearance of the cells / column and band headers.
In the attached image you'll see my problem. I added some behaviour to the grid, so you can Drag and Drop multiple cells(extended the example E3533).
In this decorator the event CustomDrawCell is used to draw the rectangles to indicate the drop area.




I have another decorator where I change the appearence according to the values of the cells. This is done by using the RowCellStyle event
this is what I do on RowCellStyle(to preserve the standard behaviour on selection I only apply the style to cells that are not selected):



however whenever a cell appearance is changed with RowCellStyle event, the rectangle isn't drawn anymore.
is there a better way to do it or any suggestions?
I have another issue with the CustomDrawColumnHeader and CustomDrawBandHeader, where i simply would like to change the background color, but it seems that this is overridden by some standard - Handler. 
In general I would like to avoid to set handled to true and implement all the drawing myself...

Hello,
I want to build an AspxFormLayout  where I will set the functionality of the form at runtime. Specifically, based on the role that the user will have,  I want to retrieve the form settings from the database and setup my form on loading. When I say form settings what I mean is whether some items will be visible and whether some items will be required. I did manage to set visibility status but I m finding it really hard to setup the required property at runtime. Is there any chance you can create a sample project for me ? Thank you!

Michael,
I need to filter resources in Events List View. In other words I do not want to display Rousource2 when Resource1 is selected in the popup. The solution still displays the column for Resource2 after filter is applied. 
The approach described in E1255 does not provide a solution. The only way to filter resources in this example is to subscribe either to ResourceDataSourceCreated or ResourceDataSourceCreating unless there is a way to raise the events from the action controller. I need to filter resources after Events List View was created.
Thank you.

Hi,
I have a slight problem using the grid.
If I add a column with 
then the column is ReadOnly immediately.
The same happens if I just say AutoPopulateColumns. The column Amount gets created but is ReadOnly.
Is there something I can do to prevent this?
I have a property called "Amount " in my data, and I'd like to bind to that.
 

Hello,
i'm using custom edit form in gridcontrol for the first time. Can you please give me an example to show how to populate a combobox  in that custom edit form? I first tried to use the build in edit form and everything works fine. All comboboxes are populated.
After changing to my custom edit form the comboboxes don't show items anymore, only the value from bounded datatable.
Thanks for support!
Michael

The attached example project is based on the sample that Alexey provided here :-
Specifically, I am trying to implement  a MultilineComboBoxEdit component which will allows for any number of lines to be displayed in the EDIT box, but also for 
items to be allowed (and drawn correctly) in the dropdown list too.
To achieve this, I  override the 
 method, and hook in to the 
 event.
As you'll see when you run the sample code however, the event never gets fired.
Please can you tell me if this is a bug or am I doing something wrong? 

I have attached a sample application that demonstrates the behavior.  If you run the program as I've delivered it, you will see the bad behavior.  The tabs of the TabControl overlap the window's title bar.  If you add a top margin to the DXTabControl, such as Margin="0,2,0,0", the control will then position itself correctly. 

Hi folks,
i'm trying to add predefined DataSources to the  Data Source Wizard of the AspxDashboad Control.
Adding a SQL type database  works like a charm. The question is: How to handle Excel/CSV/XML DataSources.

 and your comment:
 You recommended to create and use "Excel Data Sources". However, i do not know how to integrate this in the DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider? Because the DataSources, which should be added to the wizard, are manually created by the end use, i think i need the DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider for creating the entries in the Data Source Wizard?

Hi there,
I would like to use a stacked bar chart in my application.
You can see the current databaseoutput in the picture attached.
Now the Problem:

The OrganizationalUnits are totally random. In this Example its A,B,C, the next are 15 different integers, the next are 7 differnet alphanumerical and so on.

Hi. I've upgraded some project from Dx 17.1 to 17.2.5 and after upgrade some of my custom code does not work any more. I'm using xtradiagram with customized DiagramShape. I have also custom DiagramShapeView becouse I do some custom draw inside it.
After upgrade to 17.2 my custom shapes are not visible on diagram control.
I've minimized my custom code to represent problem in attachment.  When form is loaded i create two shapes:
- one simple DiagramShape which is visible
- one custom Diagram shape which is not visible
Custom diagram shape has very little custom code so I hope that you can help me quick.

Dear,
I my application I use a pivot grid, based on a certain field in the data set i use a specific xtraEditor.
The application is initially build in devexpress version 16.2.6.0, for a change request we upgraded to devexpress version 17.2.4.0. 
Since the upgrade the editors in the pivor grid behave different.
In version 16 the editors mask was also used to display the cell value, even when not editing.
In version 17 we need to enter the cell to get the corresponding editor to display.
I have attached 4 screenshots, 2 from version 16 while displaying and while editing, and the same 2 for version 17.
In the change log I can't find any changes or breaking changes.
Can you advise on this topic?
 

Hi DevExpress Team,
how do I show the areas in a stacked area chart  similiar to a StackedGroup in a stacked bar char? Please see the attached file StackedArea1, that shows a stacked area chart.  The upper, red area's first point has a value of 10.2, but it is shown at 16 on the y axis(which is correct by design, but not what I need). The second file, Area1, shows an area chart for the same values, where the points are shown correct on the y axis, but the bottom area with the smaler values is in the background. So for me there are two ways to solve the problem:
1. align the values in the stacked area chart or
2. bring the bottom area in the area chart in the foreground. 
How do I achieve one of it? 
Many thanks & kind regards,
Patrick

Hello,
Following the demo presented here 
, I'm locking some collums in my spreadsheet. 
The problem is that the spreadsheet component is giving a strange behavior with this locking feature.
 When i edit those locked columns it calls the CallbackRouteValues as you have on your demo(so far so good!), but when i change a value of a different(unlocked) cell, which has a list data validation , it also calls the endpoint defined in CallbackRouteValues.
This last call is unexpected, since  when i remove this locking feature this call doesn't happen.
Maybe i'm not understanding who calls the endpoint of the CallbackRouteValues, and i can't find any detailed information about this.
Can you explain me why this is happening? I really need this locking Feature! 

I've added this to my main mdiparent
works perfect!
Another question. Is there a way to have next to the X button the 
? Also change it's behavior to (when Minimize) 
, and (when maximize) 
?

After upgrading 17.1.5 to the current 17.2.5 I no longer have the DevExpress "Add" menu item.  This is found on the right click menu when selecting a folder like BusinessObjects, Controllers, etc.  Any idea what happened ?  I attached a screen shot to clarify.

In my application, I have used the repositoryItemLookupEdit and when I double click on the grid row to edit, I am able to do an incremental seacrh with the properties SearchMode set to Autofilter.
I have another form that uses the LookUpEdit control and this control does not do the incremental search.    I read a previous article telling me that this functionality is not available iin current versions.   I don't understand the rational behind this as the repositoryItemLookupEdit has LookupEdit as its base object (or so I understand).  One would expect identical properties and behavior in both of these controls.
I want to be able to use the LookUpEdit to search in ComboBox.   I have tried both the SearchLookupEdit and GridLookupEdit controls and their behavior is not what I want for searching and neither allow for incremental searching.
Are there any other controls that can give me this functionality ?

On AppendNode, I have to set  a temporary Id for the new node which will be overwritten in the database by the Identity (on the Id column), if we create children for this node, they will be linked to this temporary Id, but will not be overwritten with the previously mentioned Id in database (on the ParentId column).
On the client it is looking fine, but when we save it, we  lose the  relationships between the newly created nodes.
Do you have a solution that would allow us to insert the newly created identity value into the ParentId as well? 

Hello! I had the following problem situation:
1) The following line is stored in the xml form settings file:




2) In the program, the date (01.11.2017) from this file is correctly read and saved in a string. The value 01.11.2017 is stored in the line. Next I assign this value to my DataEdit :



where 
is string with the correct date value,  
 is DataEdit.
3) Next, a form opens on which the dtpPeriodFrom date is displayed correctly, that is, the value is displayed 
. 
4) Next, when I click on an element or click on a black triangle, the value in dtpPeriodFrom is displayed as 
, which is incorrect.
5) Then when I shift focus to another element the value dtpPeriodFrom to become true, i.e. 
.
: how to correct this situation so that in both cases the dtpPeriodFrom value is displayed as 11.01.2017.
: In the attached video file, I showed this problem in detail.

Hello Paul, 
Ok but when i apply the filter by column , is it a easy way to set the autofilter condition from column with the criteria operator's column ? 
Thank you !  

Hi, 
I am working with dxTreeList in on-demand mode, as explained 
. 
In the dataSource's loadData() I make calls to my REST API to obtain proper data. My situation is a bit specific though, because I am not able to determine (easily) for a node whether it has children or not thus I am not able to provide a property similar to hasItems
as in the referenced example. When such a node (let's name 'A') is expanded (in dxTreeList) and turns out be empty, my REST API returns an empty array, which I return from the loadData() method. dxTreeList recognizes this situation and the "triangle" (allowing to expand the node) disappears. 
The problem is that when I try to expand other nodes, the dxTreeList keeps asking for children of that 'A' node all over again. In fact it keeps asking for children of any node similar to 'A'. 
So, the question is what to return from loadData() in order to notify dxTreeList that there are no children of this node and makes no sense to keep asking again? In my case checking whether node has children is expensive thus I would like to avoid doing it all over again (more and more on each request). 
I have slightly modified your example to show the problem: 
  It is not perfect (produces 500-errors) but shows the behavior I am talking about - just try to expand any "file" node and then try to expand other node - you will notice on console that dxTreeList keeps asking for children of the previous node as well. 
Another observation: if I do provide a property hasItems (always true) in data I return (of e.g. node 'A') and the loadData() returns empty array then dxTreeList keeps asking for children (as described above) but additionally the triangle does not disappear in this case. 
greetings

Hello,
I've another question on the ASPxTreelist.
 Strange or not: I'm willing to build my own customization window.
However, in the source where I've to handle the information of the tree, I can't reach the tree. I've only the information saved by 
My question: is it possible to retrieve information on the visibility of the columns of the ASPxTreelist from this byte array?
And if this is possible: how to do this!?

Hello,
I have a api that returns Unix time stamp dates, can DevExtreme convert the unix timestamps to normal format and for fill the column filter function properly. I was able to use

Hi,
I am trying to style the menu of a PageView. I've found this 
 where you create a ControlTemplate in Resources. That makes sense, even if I haven't completely understood the ControlTemplate.
My problem is I can't get rid of the 1px seperator between the items. Where? How? =)
Many thanks

Hi Svetlana,
I have implemented by having a separate list and compared that list for grid columns without assigning  the values into Columns Sort Index. 
Is the  above approach comparing and displaying the fields based on order can be implemented for  Pivot grid as well . please let me know.

After upgrading to version 17.2.5 I noticed a new action appearing in my toolbar, called "Modify Model".  Not sure if one of us unknowingly did something to cause this to appear, but I can't find any information about it.  Can you please explain this item to me?  Thank you.

Hi

Hello,
I had implemented  a popupform from PopupGridLookUpEditForm.
My code is
  public class myLookupPopupForm : PopupGridLookUpEditForm {
            public myLookupPopupForm(myCheckLookup ownerEdit)
                : base(ownerEdit) {
                this.fShowOkButton = true;
                View.OptionsView.ShowHorizontalLines = DefaultBoolean.False;
                View.OptionsView.ShowVerticalLines = View.Columns.Count > 2 ? DefaultBoolean.True : DefaultBoolean.False;
                View.OptionsView.ShowIndicator = false;
                View.OptionsSelection.MultiSelect = true;
                View.OptionsView.ShowColumnHeaders = View.Columns.Count > 2;
                View.BorderStyle = BorderStyles.NoBorder;
                View.MouseDown += new MouseEventHandler(View_MouseDown);
                View.KeyDown += new KeyEventHandler(View_KeyDown);
                View.CustomDrawCell += new RowCellCustomDrawEventHandler(View_CustomDrawCell);
            }
  .......
After upgrade the properties ShowHorizontalLines, ShowVerticalLines, CustomDrawCell  not exists, because view is now ColumnView and not GridView.
What can I do.
 

I have reproduced the issue on my side and decided to forward it to our developers, so they can examine it thoroughly. This might take some time for us. We will update this thread once we have any progress on this issue.

Hello,
In the following sample, if the value of minWidth is too small, column width is not specified and scrolling doesn't  trigger
 

I have created an repx with a schema datasource that points to CustomEventList (BindingList) class that is returned to the objectdatasource for scheduler.
 Whether I use ObjectDataSource.Select() or create a new CustomEventList from ObjectDataSource.Select() and pass it to the report DataSource, I get the same results:
-  If I don't set the DataMember, then only 1 record is shown in the print preview.
-  If I set the DataMember, then I receive this error message:
An object assigned to the DataSource property cannot be used as a report's datasource, because it does not implement any of supported interfaces.
 
 

This is probably very simple, but I don't see it. I have this code:
@Html.DevExpress().PageControl(settings =>
{
    settings.Name = "RecoveryPageControl";
    settings.ActiveTabIndex = viewDataTabIndex;
    settings.TabPages.Add(PortalResources.Resource.ClaimsToApproveOrRejectTabCaption).SetContent(() =>
    {
        Html.RenderAction("ToBeApprovedOrRejectedClaims", "ClaimRecovery");
    });
    settings.TabPages.Add(PortalResources.Resource.ApprovedClaimsTabCaption).SetContent(() =>
    {
        Html.RenderAction("ApprovedClaims", "ClaimRecovery");
    });
}).GetHtml()
<br />
<input type="button"
       class="btn btn-info"
       onclick="location.href='@Url.Action("ExportGrid", "ClaimRecovery")?tabIndex=' + GetTabIndex()"
       value=@PortalResources.Resource.ExportToPdfButtonCaption />
@Html.Partial("BackButton")
<script type="text/javascript">
    function GetTabIndex() {
        $("#RecoveryPageControl").GetActiveTabIndex();
    }
</script>
When clicking the  ExportToPdf-button, it should get the active tabindex  from the PageControl, but nothing happens when I click it.
Can you see what I'm doing wrong?
 

If i insert a Hyperlink in a Picture on a Text Box widget in a Dashboard, it works fine if i see it in the Desktop viewer, however, when i see it in the Web viewer, the link doesn't work and the picture is in a different position than in the design.

I have implemented code that incrementally searches a text field for matches.  When the user types, the list if filtered, but no item is selected in the dropdown unless there is a unique text match.  In the screen shot attached, you can see an example where I typed TO in the grid, and the dropdown properly returned all rows that contain TO (case insensitive).  
Unless there are no matches at all, I want to force the user to select one of the values before the dropdown closes so that a blank value is not allowed to be returned to the grid.
How can I do this?
  

When Form.Shown is triggered, I call/set SchedulerControl.GoToDate() / SchedulerControl.Start to set the scheduler to a specific visible interval. This triggers the SchedulerControl.VisibleIntervalChanged event in which I call SchedulerControl.ActiveView.GetVisibleInterval() to retrieve the current visible interval and set data specific to this interval. However the visible interval is wrong, only returning the (shorter) visible interval as shown in the designer in VisualStudio.
Calling Application.DoEvents() before calling SchedulerControl.GoToDate() fixes the problem. When running the application with this fix you can see that the scheduler snaps to the correct size before calling VisibleIntervalChanged (which he did not do before the fix). It seems that there is a bug in the scheduler, where VisibleIntervalChanged is called before calculating the correct size of the scheduler.
After the form is shown and i call SchedulerControl.GoToDate by pressing a button (to switch to next/previous week) everything is fine, because the form/scheduler is already resized to the correct window size.
Im running the scheduler with SchedulerControl.OptionsBehaviour.UseAsyncMode = false, so there should not be any problems because of async operations.

Hi,
I have configured some reports for a client of ours.
These reports use an SQL data source with 2 Stored Procedures that return the necessary data.
The stored procedures that do not use parameters work fine.
The other stored procedures  that do use parameters do not return any data.
I have configured the report to use two parameters. One called "StartDate", the other one "EndDate". Both are of type Date.
My stored procedures that use parameters have two parameters configured. One called "StartDate" and one called "EndDate".
These are both of type "Expression". The value for the StartDate parameter is [Parameters.StartDate]. The value for the EndDate parameter is [Parameters.EndDate] .
I believe this is the correct configuration to pass Date parameters from the report to the stored procedures. Unfortunately this does not work.
The stored procedures do not return any data.
Could you tell me how I can configure the report and stored procedures so that they actually return data?
Thanks.

Hello,
I was just wondering how you would collapse/shrink a table cell that has multiple columns.
For example - Attached Image 1
I would want to shrink the null lines to prevent having gaps on the report. So it would instead appear like this (attached image 2).
Is this possible without separating both columns into separate tables  in order to use CanShrink and Process Null Values - Suppress and Shrink.
Thanks,
Tom

Greetings, I have an issue setting the height of a cardview control.  In other projects where I am able to use a splitter, I can use the resize events and set the cardview height to 100% of the client area using javascript.
In this current situation, I have a cardview in Table Layout Mode, in  a partial view, and it is injected as part of a bootstrap 4 column like this:
If I set paging to Endless, the cardview contracts and only shows Header Pane, one card (with scrollbars to show the rest) and the footer.
If I set paging to something normal, it adheres to pager settings and the control at least seems to conform to verticalscrollableheight
These are my settings (those of interest anyway)
If it matters any, the card content is custom, but that part generally works.
My main question is, lacking a splitter control to be able to get pane.clientheight, is there way to set the cardview to max bootstrap column height?
Also, asuming that I want the cardview to fill the client height and use endless paging, what settings do I need to use?

Hi,
I am using a view to load the data into my gridview.  I am using On row updating to save my info into different tables.  I do not need to use the gridview UPDATE command but it is determined to use it.  
I have added e.cancel to my on row updating function and it works perfectly when I run it through debug in visual studio.  When I publish my code to the website I receive this error.
DXCallbackErrorMessage=Updating is not supported by data source SqlDataSource1 unless UpdateCommand is specified.
How do I work around this error?

Hi,
is there anyway to change the find panels settings that it's not necessary to use the + sign to connect two words.
If you want to find an exact term you have to use quotes, but for an end user who want the search on exactly the two words it is quite annoying to quote everything.
i can not find a setting to overrule this? There should be a setting to switch between like and contains or something?
i have found this thread: 
but i can not find the 
 method in my gridview descendant... perhaps it is old ?
thanks

Hi guys!
I've faced an issue that I cannot change an item in virtual mode of XtraTreeList .
Please see the attached project.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the solution
2. Click on the "Change item"  button.
Expected result:
"aaa 2"  should be displayed
Actual result:
"aaa"  remains
Please pay attention to additional pieces of code in the simpleButton2_Click method: 
Some strange things happen if the first line remains uncommented.

In may application (using HybridApp as Template) I have one TdxTilecontrol with three tiles used as buttons.
The buttons opens a second frame for some user entry.
The function is ok, but the dxTilecontrols shows unwanted scrollbuttons, see screenshot, they are not only unwanted, but have no useful function.
dxTileControls OptionsBehaviour.Scrollmode has no influence here.
The tileControl is contained in a dxLayoutItem, which is part of a dxLayoutgroup.
The LayoutgroupRoot has both scrolloptions set to smNone.
Currently the only known way to get rid of these buttons is to put a lot  of spaces after the dxTileControl.Title.Text ("create / delete").
This  is the only difference between the two lower screenshots.
Is there another way to suppress display of the scrollbuttons ?

I am using skins, which automatically skin any TPanels on a form.
On one of my forms, I have a few TPanels which  should not be skinned because I need to control their colour.
So, I have  excluded seClient from MyPanel.StyleElements, hoping that might do what I want. It seems to work at design time (ie I can set their colour) but not at runtime (they still get the colour of the current skin and setting the colour in code has no effect).
Is it possible to do what I want? 

Hello, i have a gridview and i would like to set up  a custom edit template.
I have done this in razor and it is pretty simple i just need to do this

                    string NDC = c.Grid.GetRowValues(c.Grid.EditingRowVisibleIndex, c.Column.FieldName).ToString();

                    textboxSett.ControlStyle.CssClass = "textCharges";
                    textboxSett.Text = d.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy");
                }).Render();
 
                });
but since this gridview im generating the settings in a C# Controller dont know how to make this possible in the c# controller.
because i cant call HTML.Devexpress().Label

We'd like to go from our Addict Spell Checker control to your spell checker library, but there is a very important feature which you do not seem to have based on 5 year old tickets...namely the ability to see a misspelled word even when the editor containing the misspelling is not in focus. A TO-DO ticket for this feature was created a decade ago, but there is no information on it. Will this ever be in the radar for DevExpress as far as implementing it? Or are there too few users taking advantage of the feature to care about it? Please let me know so I can decide what direction to take on this.

Hello DevEx Support, 
I was wondering if DevExpress has an ability to track the changes happened to xtraeditors controls. In other words, how to find out changes happened to each control. For an example: Checkbox - checked to unchecked; TextBox Text changed from "hello"  -"hello world";  GridControl changes too.  
Please let me know your feedback. 
Thanks,

Hi 
Attached is a simple project containing a ribbon, some buttons and svg icons.  Some have overlays and you'll notice that they appear to have a dark background.   At first I thought that this might bee a problem with the tool used to create the icons so I contacted Axialis about it.  They looked into it and found 
 which seems to suggest that the problem ought to have been fixed, however as you can see this is a project built with 17.2.5 and clearly it isn't.
Any idea when it will be fixed.  This makes the use of svg icons problematic at best.

Hi,
I've noticed that the rendering of the DataGrid pager's navigation buttons differs from time to time. 
Most of the time, it shows a left chevron icon for back and right chevron icon for next and in between is the page numbers. But there are times when it changes the page numbers in between the back and next buttons with a numberbox (with the current page) and the total pages (see attached).
Is there a way to make navigation part of the pager look like the attached?
Thanks!

I have an ASPxPopUp control which is a re-usable control for displaying multiple user controls... what I'm not certain is where I would place the ASPxHiddenField to make it available to the popup and the user controls... Currently it is located within a ContentTemplate...
I used an existing implementation of this style of Popup to build this one, but I wasn't using a hidden field in my prior example.  I was hoping that I could use one common hidden field as opposed to having multiple ones (one for each window), but as the program doesn't "know" about the hidden field I obviously have it in the wrong location... I would greatly appreciate it if someone could point out where I could place this hidden field.  I'm of the opinion that it needs to be within the CallbackPanel, just not certain where. 
 

I have tried to integrate the Dev Express Menu Bind template into my project in VS 2017 MVC 5 Razor pages. I can execute the menu as a stand alone in a separate View folder and it works fine.
The issue is how to incorporate it into all of my page from the Shared HeaderPartialView.  The _rootLayout and Header page keeps giving error that the models will not co-exist. Tried to change the enum code in HomeController to no avail. Tried to research prior topics to no useful information. Examples do not cover the complete integration process. This is my 4th day trying get this to integrate. Please do not even think about: have I read or researched this and that. Dev Express simply does not supply adequate information in how to do complete integration for binded menus.
 I have attached my project for review and assistance.
Thank You!

I have developed a c# add-in used inside of SolidWorks.  I was disappointed to see that the devexpress reports sit there showing "waiting" when I try to launch them through the add-in but work fine when I run the same reports outside the add-in.  Someone else reported a similar issue when using reports inside of WPF so I tried the recommended solution.  It worked.. but it is an endless loop that pegs the processor when nothing is going on.  Not a good solution.  Any other ideas?  BTW, it would be good to add a warning next to that solution.  My users suffered performance problems and other strange behavior for over 2 weeks before I figured out that that "solution" was the problem.

See example app:
Reproduction steps:
1. Open example app
2. Open browser debug toolbar
3. Click the button to open the popup
4. Click the close ("X") button or click the "Toggle" button to close the popup
5. Debugger should hit breakpoint inside  `popup_onHiding()`
The defect is that the breakpoint is never hit because ` popup_onHiding()` is never called even though it is bound to the popup:

Hi DevExpress team,
I'm trying ot sync my scheduler with Google, using business object binding. The current issue is for syncing recurrent events and exceptions.
Thanks to 
, I've made quite some progress on the recurrences. However, I'm blocked in the "LinkOccurrencesWithPatterns" method, where I am currently able to create exceptions, but I then need to save the corresponding business object to the database.
I've created the following routine, where I explain the issues in comments.
Could you please advise as to how I can get the corresponding source object  for an exception appointment? Or maybe I'm taking it the wrong way?
Thanks in advance for your help!

I am trying to dynamically create child nodes under child nodes as needed based on data returned from a database.  I looked at the How To: Create Nodes in Unbound Mode in Code, but the sample does not go beyond the first child node.  This is what I have:

But, of course, that just puts all of the subsequent data under the first rootnode.  I would need to create a rootnode1, rootnode2, etc for however many tables there are in the dataset and the rows would append to the current node.  So,in the ELSE I'd like to be able to add the next node under the previous child node.  I though maybe there was a Nodes(0).Add that I could do, but not in this case.  Is this something I am able to do somehow?
Thank you.

I have an application that needs a sidebar menu that can be toggled as visible or hidden.
I have seen the menu example but wonder if you have a further example that shows how to contain it in a panel and hide/show it. 

Hello,
Interactive sorting in report preview  activates ParametersRequestBeforeShow event. In my case I use ParametersRequestBeforeShow to assign default values to report parameters. As the result sorting in preview changes the report. Attached is sample solution. There is a video illustrating the issue in the solution folder.
Thank you. 

I am using the scaffolding wizards to create a Parent/Child Application.  I have an need to edit the Parent entity and its Children on the same view.  Attached is a simplified example of what I am trying to accomplish.  I have the following scenario:
1.  The Parent CollectionView displays the list of parents.
2.  Double-Clicking on a Parent (or clicking on the edit button) will bring up the ParentView.  This contains both data from the Parent as well as associated Children.
3.  I have created a command called "CascadeSave".
4.  I track changes in the parent data as well as the child data and update CanCascadeSave as needed.  The idea being that when you make a change to either the parent or child data, the Save button will become active.  This part works as expected.
5.  If I make changes to the parent data and try to Close the window without saving first, I am prompted to save or cancel my changes.  However If I make changes to my child data, I would also like it to prompt me to save or cancel my changes. 
Thanks,
Anand

Hello
im using visual studio 2017 with asp net core 2.0 and MvvC, i have a form with a grid in which i use an EditCellTemplate to add some buttons to the edit form, it was working fine but after updating i am getting an error and the buttons are not rendered, i have attached a project sample so you can check the problem, just try to add a new record, in the form that opens there should be a button but its not rendered and i get an error on the console.
have any idea on what could be the issue?
regards. 

v15.1 works fine, without any error, but the below  error started happening after upgrading the application to v16.2.12

I have a DataField with an autocomplete editor using the following code:
                        groupItems.AddSimple().DataField("Chapter")
                          // .Template("<%= code %> | <%= name %>")
                          .Editor(e => e
                            .Autocomplete()
                            .Name("ChapterCode")
                            .ID("ChapterCode")
                            .Placeholder("Name or Code...")
                            .MinSearchLength(3)
                            .DataSource(d => d.Mvc().Controller("Lookups").LoadAction("Chapters"))
                            .ItemTemplate("<%= code %> | <%= name %>")
                          );
The autocomplete correctly populates the drop-down from the endpoint, but when a value is selected, the initial datafield reads [Object object]. The actual object there has two properties: 'name' and 'code.'
If I uncomment the line that starts with .Template blows up the page with the following error:
jquery.js:3855 Uncaught ReferenceError: code is not defined

How do I code this widget so that it correctly applies the template when there is a value in the control, but uses the placeholder text initially?

Hi.
We had some users report that when their application windows occupied the entire desktop (but were not maximized), they couldn't click on their Windows taskbar buttons anymore.
Turns out the Bezier skin window shadow (on an MDI window at least) is not click-through.  You cannot click anything behind the shadow, which is quite a few pixels tall.  Other skins do not behave this way.
Thanks. 

In the legacy version of the scheduler I was able to descend from ScheduleControl, like a UserControl:  
with a default  constructor like
Then I was able to use both the code behind and the xaml to specify the various resources and behaviors I needed.
Now, when I try to do this pattern with the new Scheduler, first pass it crashes with a nullref exception on ResourceBrushSchema collection, specifically line 474 of SchedulerControl.cs in the FindResourceBrushSchema method.  So, I manually added this collection and now the control does not crash, but it also never renders its UI.  If I click in the space where it should be, it throws a nullref exception in OnGotKeyboardFocus - so the control is there, but nothing is showing.
If I don't use this approach and just inherit the class and then put the xaml markup in the containing control where the scheduler is being used, the control renders.
I would prefer to keep the xaml/code behind pattern, is this possible? 

Hi,
In previous version this works $("#simple").dxNumberBox("instance").option("text"), but it doesn't work anymore with version 17.2.5 
Here is your sample codes; 
Thanks,

I need to kinds of objects for Scheduler which are 'Users' and 'Appointments'. I had been implemented like:
@model SampleNamspace.Model.Sample_Data
@(Html.DevExtreme().Scheduler()
    .ID("scheduler")
    .DataSource(
)
    ...
    .Groups(new string[] { "EmployeeID" })
    .Resources(res =>
    {
        res.Add()
            .FieldExpr("EmployeeID")
            .ColorExpr("Color")
            .DisplayExpr("Text")
            .ValueExpr("Id")
            .AllowMultiple(false)
            .Label("Employee")
            .DataSource(
);
    })
    ....
)
However, I need to use WebAPI to modify appoint for each user. How could I implement it? For instance, the Sample_Data already includes appointments and users data. Each model should be in right place into Scheduler. Let me know any advice for this.
@(Html.DevExtreme().Scheduler()
    .ID("scheduler")
     .DataSource(d => d.WebApi()
    .RouteName("SampleWeb")
    .LoadAction("Get")
    .InsertAction("Post")
    .UpdateAction("Put")
    .DeleteAction("Delete") //
     )
    ...
    .Groups(new string[] { "EmployeeID" })
    .Resources(res =>
    {
        res.Add()
            .FieldExpr("EmployeeID")
            .ColorExpr("Color")
            .DisplayExpr("Text")
            .ValueExpr("Id")
            .AllowMultiple(false)
            .Label("Employee")
            .DataSource(
);
    })
    ....
)
or Could I use both? model and Web API? because User will be fixed and only appointment will be changed.

Hello,
I am trying to upload to a subfolder in Amazon AWS via the InsertImageDialog in the HTmlEditor.
Currently I can browse, view, and select from the main folder, and all sub-folders in my Amazon bucket.
For the image upload section, however, I can only get the uploaded file to go into the bucket, not a specific subfolder. 
How can I target a specific subfolder in the bucket?

I am trying the XAF Framework for the first time and after creating a project with the Devexpress Template Gallery.  I get and error when launching the Model editor.  This is an unmodified solution straight from the wizard so I'm confused why there is an error.  The error pops up in a dialog box: 
I have rebuilt the solution and I have not been able to find any duplicate DashboardData_ListView in any class and I'm unable to get the Model Editor to open. Where would I look to find the duplicate not so the Editor will open.

I am reviewing the following 
 and had a question about the advanced option.
I am looking at the following method:
I am using external filters on the grid, which I am passing via the ClientSide BeginCallback as e.customArgs.
What I would like to know is whether or not I can access these values from the GridViewModel.
The model contains a lot of properties and it is difficult to traverse.
It would be awesome if I could get the values of the customArgs from the GridviewModel.
How would I do that?
I have attached an image, and if you need an example, please use code from the demo I referenced.
Thanks in Advance.
 

Consider the attached code, where I have a master/detail data grid, inside the detail template, I have a second data grid. On click of a custom button, I want to add a row to the nested grid.
How do I implement the addRowToNestedTable() method, where I can invoke the .addRow() of the data grid instance of the detail template?

 <dxi-column dataField="lineItemText" [allowEditing]="false" caption="Budget Line Item"></dxi-column>
 <dxi-column dataField="programCost" caption="Total Program Cost" [format]="{ type: 'currency', precision: 2 }">
 <dxi-validation-rule type="range" min="0" max="9999999" message="Total program cost is not valid"></dxi-validation-rule>
 </dxi-column>
 <div *dxTemplate="let item of 'detail'">
 <button class="iweButton secondary-normal" (click)="addRowToNestedTable(xyz)">Add supplier</button>
 <dx-data-grid [dataSource]="item.data.detail">
 <dxi-column dataField="supplierVendor" caption="Supplier">
 <dxi-validation-rule type="required" message="Supplier is Mandatory"></dxi-validation-rule>

I am using a grid with a master-detail setup. I have FocusCellOnCyle, FocusCellOnTab, and GoToNextCellOnEnter all set to true. When I tab or hit enter it focuses the next cell, and when it gets to the end of the line it moves to the next record. My question is: how do I get it to go into the detail record when it hits the end of the line, instead of jumping over the details? 

Hello,
I have been learning the Dashboard components over the last few days.  Very nice!!
When I am using a Dashboard Viewer component I have the ability to print preview and export to PDF, Image and Excel -- from the upper right hand corner of the dashboard viewer.   These print/export options bring up nice little export option screens (see attached images).  I wondering if it is possible for my program to call these options - instead of the standard ExporttoPDF, etc methods?  
Your little option windows are very nice looking - and I would like to put the same feature set in my ribbon bar at the top of my form.  It would look from a user experience point of view to have your export features from the upper right hand corner and different screens from my ribbon bar at the top.  
So - my question is "are these export options surfaced in methods I can call from the DashboardViewer component?"  If not - can they be in a future release?

Hi there,
I got a general question regarding functionality of xpServerCollectionSource, which is for example bound to a grid:
Let's assume the following scenario:
- after setting the filter criteria of my xpServerCollectionSource I loop through the results by doing the following:
- let's assume that while I am looping through, the table in database is updated with records that would also suit to the set criteria of my xpServerCollectionSource
So my question:
What happens while we are looping? Are these new datasets in the database table also taken into account or is the IListServer storing the Oids of my original criteria result and by having the oids only those data sets are loaded while looping?
Thanks in advance for your reply.

I have a ASPxClientCombo that changes value based on other parts of the form.
In some scenarios, I would like to put the Combo into Readonly mode - meaning that that the following should happen:
1) Editor's borders disappear
2) Editor's dropdown does not show when the editor is clicked.
3) Dropdown button is hidden
I already know that you can get alot of this fuctionality if you call the ASPxClientCombo.SetEnabled function, however, I need whatever value that has been placed into the editor to be included in the post.

Hello Supportteam,
I have to open and Close the Header/fooder section by Code instead of going via the Buttons from the ribbon  (Ribbon will not be visible to Enduser).
Hope you can share a small Code snippet .

Dear Support,
I have a form with a Search function and a treelist for results.  The search finds relevant data and performs a callback on the treelist to poulate the data.  This all works well EXCEPT the Treelist displays all data collapsed.  This is in spite of the fact that I have:
settings.SettingsBehavior.AutoExpandAllNodes = true;
I am sure this is not correct behaviour?

Hi ,
I have a cxGrid with unbounded data.
In my application I can switch to different scales. I use therefore the ScaleForPPI procedure.
A table with master/detail rows  the master row is scaled correct, but the detail rows the width of the columns does not scall correct.
Initial (When DPI value is before the grid is visible) it resizes correct.
I have attached the before and after  scaling during runtime.

Hello Devexpress,
How I can change the default printing option for the chart control
I need to  set the landscape to true and the margins to 0 every time the preview or export has done for the chart control 
please see my video
thanks. 

This is a two part question but since they both revolve around disabling dates and times I think they can be asked together in the same ticket. Feel free to separate them if you think it's necessary.
How to programatically disable some dates in dxDateBox when the type is set to "date"  or "datetime". I would like to calculate some stuff and based on the result I want to disable a date. An example would be week working hours where Sunday is marked as "not working". based on this information I would want to disable all of Sundays in the calendar. Now, I know this can be achieved by filling up an array of Sundays but I want to avoid that.
This basically continues the first question but this time it is about times. So I would like to know if times can be disabled when dxDateBox type is set to "time". When I get the time picker, or whatever else I am getting depending on the theme,  I want to disable certain times so I cannot pick them at all. An example would be same as above but with accent on working hours. If a shop is opened from 08:00 in the morning untill 04:00 in the afternoon I would like all other times to be grayed out(unselectable) or not available at all. For this matter I would also like to know if min and max can work for times as well.

Hi,
There is a problem in scaling to a different DPI with the header of an TcxGridBandedTableView when the option (view) HeaderAutoHeight is false.
The header is not scaled based on the DPI setting which I had expected.
The following code I use to fix this problem manually



where the "aScaleFactor" is the factor of NewDPI / OldDPI .

Hello !
I have a customer needs to order their labels by dimensions. I was using 
 page as a guide and tried everything but couldn't arrange labels as we want. So I had an idea and I made ordering labels by SQL query. So I don't have any group on my label project. But when I try my new way I get a result as like in the attachment. I drew my screen file as I want. So how can I do it? Help me please, this is my only problem to sell my project to a customer.

Hello,
I am copying complete layout of an existing report at run-time . but the data-source structure for new report is slightly different ..  now when I am assigning the new datasource  .. in design mode report is showing both datasources .. new one which I am assigining and the old one which the other report already have .. why it is not replacing th datasource?
Here is what I am doing:
 Designer is showing two datasources:
Class2
Class1
Please suggest how to completely replace  the data-source with previous one.
Thanks in advance. 

Still on steep learning curve. Shouldn't I see the refresh button with this code? Do I need to do something extra to this generated code that otherwise works well?

How to set RowCount and CaptionLocation for all string (SizeAttribute.Unlimited) property editors runtime. Eq in AddGeneratorUpdaters.
 

Hello,
I have a GridView with a number of columns which I add at runtime. Among these there is an unbound column, to which I assign a RepositoryItemPopupContainerEdit.
I then assign an existing PopupContainerControl to the RepositoryItemPopupContainerEdit.PopupContol property.
If I for any reason clear the GridView.Columns colection, it automatically not only disposes of the  RepositoryItemPopupContainerEdit, but it also disposes the PopupControlContainer, which I believe it should not do. 
Does anyone have any thought on this? Is there a way around this, other than creating a new PopupContainerControl and all of its contents each time I create the unbound column? 
EDIT: I have figured out the disposal of the PopupContainerControl occurs at Grid.RepositoryItems.Clear(). So disposing of the RepositoryItemPopupContainerEdit will automatically dispose of the PopupContainerContol as well. How can I avoid this??
Thank you!

Hi
I know XtraRichEdit has a syntax highlighting mode which can be enabled globally. But what I'd like to do instead is insert code snippets into a regular document, much like many cloud editors offer it (including the one here on DX support). 
The inserted snippets should be formatted with basic C# syntax highlighting and the usual "gray box background".
Do you have a working sample of something like this, or can you point me in the right direction?
Thanks,
Marco
 

I need to rewrite an old MS Access/SQL Server application that I created for a client over 15 years ago into something browser based for them this year. I've recently created a couple of simple PHP MVC pages for them using Codeigniter and have also been messing around with Laravel. The Codeigniter version I did works great but it's a lot of work and the presentation isn't all that impressive. Just basic nuts and bolts stuff.
10 years ago I used DevExpress ASP.NET Web Forms in VS 2008 I think to create a website for a high school reunion class. It turned out really great but development was SOOOOOO slow. I remember working on forms that just took forever to change things and save. It was a total nightmare. In fact I created a ticket about it at the time. Lots of people followed it and I don't think it got any real results. Based on a similar experience I've had very recently and also written a ticket about with a vb.net application I'm also working on where a form with TONS of controls is super slow when I rename controls, I'm very worried about doing any heavy duty work in VS any more. This is why I fiddled around with Codeigniter and Laravel last week. It's all very fast to work with. No delays when naming/renaming/saving, etc. Just works right away lickity split. It's not annoying.
So having done MVC work with Codeigniter and Laravel and having a DevExpress license that includes ASP.NET MVC I decided to check into the MVC side of DevExpress. My fear though is that even though it's MVC  it's still ASP.NET and Visual Studio and I'm still going to sit there swearing at my computer for delaying my work. I'm writing this to find out what others have experienced in this area. I can't spend the next year rewriting something big with frustration after frustration due to IDE speed issues. 
Or would I be happier with DevExtreme?
To be clear, the existing project is going to be run on a local network. That might change once they start using it. I don't know. For now, they say they don't want to open up access to it outside their offices. MS SQL will remain the database for this. That's not changing. It will have loads of forms and reports. The MS Access project is quite extensive.
Any input on this would be greatly appreciated. :-)
Thanks,
Keith :-)

Hi, I use my own procedures to draw checkboxes on a spreadsheet and respond to user clicks. I use custom drawing:
Of course this approach makes my check boxes invisible on print. Could you tell me if there is any approach which, would allow: 
1) drawing on canvas in the same manner, 
2) drawing checkbox on a print canvas in any other way?

Hi Devexpress team,
We are using XPO Datasource for binding AspxGridview control. We are using devexpress 16.2.6.0 version. In our application, we are using multiple VertPads on a single Aspx page. Each VertPad requires an AspxGridview control. User is allowed to  search records on each VertPad on this apsx page. 
In this application, we are allowing multiple users to switch  from one database to another. We are required to clear all vertpads on the single aspx page when the end user clicks on the option to switch the DataBase. 
Can anyone suggest an easy Jquery or another option to clear all data of all VertPads on a single aspx page ?

Hi,
Is there a quick way to remove ALL the lines in an ASPxGridView so that you dont have to do it in a lot of places like:
                        <Styles>
                            <Header Border-BorderWidth="0px">
                            </Header>
                            <Cell Border-BorderWidth="0px">
                            </Cell>
                            <CommandColumn Border-BorderWidth="0px">
                            </CommandColumn>
                        </Styles>

hi. I have been facing a problem for a while, in certain scenarios when the user save an object, for instance, I do some validations and if it's the case I need to display some information to the user and ask if he wants to continue and save the object or if he wants to cancel the save process in order to correct the issue in the detail view and press the save button again. I am working with XAF Web and with EF, I do implement the interface that provide me acces to the OnSaving method that allow me to cancel the saving proccess by throwing an exception but don?t know how to accomplish the desired behaviour. Basically when the user press Save, Save and new o Save and close, i need to display a popup with a custom text if some condition is rigth, that allow him to continue or cancel the save process. I will be pleace if you point me in the correct direction or even more if you have some demo example, from my point of view it?s a commun scenario but I have been unable to located the proper documentation or example.
Thank you very much

I have attached a sample which describes the grid behavior when added to ToolStripDropDown
When I put the grid in toolstrip it loses its datasource
Please look at the project attached
 

Hi,
Please refer to the  attached project along with a snapshot of issue i am facing. I am not sure whether this has anything to do with V17.2.3 specifically because this issue was not existing in earlier version i was using V17.1.4.
The issue is that if a report contains multiple datasources then only one datasource is being listed in the fileds selection box, all others are not being displayed at all. In the attached sample project, i have created to 2 datasources dsEmployee and dsReportSettings, only dsEmployee is seen in the filed selection box and dsReportsettings is not shown at all. 

Hi, I have a simple gridview, the responsive layout is not working.

I have various Devexpress bootstrap controls on my web page (BootstrapComboBox, BootstrapTextbox, BootstrapDateEdit, BootstrapUploadControl) and I would like to validate all of them on the server as well as the client.  I tried the approach listed in 
:
"To validate all editors on a page, call one of the following methods with a 
 or 
 parameter."
code:  Dim isValid As Boolean = DevExpress.Web.ASPxEdit.ValidateEditorsInContainer(Nothing)
The line of code above threw the following exception: An exception of type 'System.ArgumentNullException' occurred in DevExpress.Web.v17.2.dll but was not handled in user code.
I am coding in VB.NET and I had to pass Nothing as the argument as String.Empty throws a compiler error.  
Please tell me how I can validate all DevEx editor controls on my page on the server in addition to the client.  Please provide a complete code example.  tyvm 
 

I have the need to allow users to print the Gantt Charts that have been programmatically created. To create the chart there's needs to be control over the size so the other elements can be rendered appropriately. The sizing has been worked out to fit a maximum of 7 projects. This means when the data has more than 7 projects an additional WebChartControl will be created.
I need to provide the ability to export (minimally to PDF) each WebChartControl.
This issue is closely associated with T603746
However, I have included a zip that contains the code that has test data containing more than 7 projects so 2 WebChartControls are created. 

I'm trying to create a report linked to our XPO classes to wee how it all hangs together, but when I select any of our Xpo classes the designer just sees to ramps up memory until it runs out of memory.
I suspect that as our objects eventually link back onto themselves it's not recognising that it already has the details of the class it is loading and just loads it all again and so on?

When using IReportStorage if you close the window using the (x) and Cancel, nothing happens from then on if you try to close the window again.

Adding parameter to SQL query in report, always seems to return to Number() regardless of what I set it to.  I change to String, but back it goes when it saves. 

I am using both Automatic Mask and Manual Validation Rule method to valide my TextEdit Control
So for example
                <dxlc:LayoutItem Label="Email">
                    <dxe:TextEdit 
                                  InvalidValueBehavior="WaitForValidValue" Name="txtEmail" 
                                  NullText="Please input email address" NullValue="" AllowNullInput="False" ShowNullTextForEmptyValue="True"
                                 MaskType="RegEx" Mask="[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"
                                  ValidateOnEnterKeyPressed="False" ValidateOnTextInput="True" CausesValidation="True">
                        <dxe:TextEdit.EditValue>
                            <Binding Path="input.Email" UpdateSourceTrigger="PropertyChanged" Mode="TwoWay">
                                <Binding.ValidationRules>
                                    <validate:RequiredValidationRule FieldName="Email"/>
                                </Binding.ValidationRules>
                            </Binding>
                        </dxe:TextEdit.EditValue>
                    </dxe:TextEdit>
                </dxlc:LayoutItem>
My question is , when the validation has error, i want to give a validation error message on the screen
may i know how to do that ?  
 

Hi,
I set the properties with the GridLookup control, 
Because the Popup is too big, so I add the following codes
But the checkbox does not display. Why?
How can I do that?

I want to change the normal scrollbar's style to the smart style likes the demo shows us, I had put the pictrue in the attachment, please check it, after that, can you tell me how can I set the properties?

Hi
In a View using the GridControl I want to show in the FixedTotalSummary
1) The Total row count. That is the full count of the ItemsSource BEFORE any column filters and search criteria are applied
2) The 'filtered' row count, i.e. what is shown on screen AFTER any column filters and search criteria are applied
I can get (2) to happen using the following XAML
but I don't know how to get (1).   
Ideally, what I would like to show is ONE message in the FixedTotalSummary so that
when there are NO filtered rows : Message = "Row Count = XXX"  
when there are >0 filtered rows : Message = "Row Count = YYY of XXX"
Is any of this possible?
Thanks for any help.
 

When we add new columns to already existing tables the value for that new data column is set to "NULL" in already existing datasets.
In this case we added a bool value to the domain object and altered the filter criteria for a gridView from:
to:
We are pretty sure that previously the above criteria was true for values not being true also included "NULL"-values.
Since all our old datasets have the NULL-value in the new column, we get no result anymore for the criteria. Is that a bug in the current version or is this a wanted change? As soon as we run an SQL-update over the new column, setting the new column values to "0", the above new criteria works as needed 

Hello!
I am looking for a set of examples, ideally one per project, illustrating the following:
1) How to keep a current word count of the document
2) How to keep a paragraph count
3) Each of the status bar updates in the demo (Modified, zoom, yadda yadda).
This is because the example is way too complex and difficult to follow and it does not show word and paragraph count.
Thanks!

I want to use a custom message when deleting a row in a grid and followed the steps in 
. This requires that I replace the  GridViewToolbarCommand.Delete button with a GridViewToolbarCommand.Custom button. 
To keep the look of the toolbar buttons consistent I want to use the same icon for my custom button as is used by the Delete button. 
Is there a way to set the icon  to the same icon as used by GridViewToolbarCommand.Delete?

I've recently upgraded from v16 to v17.4 and I'm receiving numerous exception reports from different users, clearly related to the DevExpress components. These exceptions seem random and affect different users, with no clear way to reproduce them.
The intention of this message double:
1. To provide DevExpress with any piece of feedback that may lead to solving these problems, even when it's not very specific
2. Ask for some kind of general solution to catch these exceptions and gather better information about the scenario.
I was thinking of having a chart, grid and pivotgrid descendant that may catch these exceptions, log them in more detail and be able to reload itself, since the reports I get are sent when my whole app crashes.
Here are excerpts of several exceptions I've received in the past week (I have more trace information on each one of them, but I think that the relevant parts are what I paste below):

Hello there,
I am still learning this MVVM thing and getting more familiar with the messenger service. I am currently wondering what is practical to send via the messenger? 
   
  I see pretty much all the examples on the devexpress website and support center seem  to pass around messages that only indicate whether an entity has been changed, added,  removed etc.....of which the recipient of the message would then have to  look up/refresh the data from the database or some other source. 
   
  I am wondering, why not just pass a whole view model or model object? I  am obviously inexperienced, but it seems like passing whole viewmodels  would save me trips to the database.  One thought I have is that it may cause threading issues...but I'm interested to know why I don't see anybody doing it that way?
If anyone has any thoughts, I'd be super grateful to discuss it
Thank you

Hello,
After upgrading to v17.1.2, the column menu of grid is not shown any more. How can I solve this problem.
I have attached a sample project. 

Hi,
The problem introduction is probably necessary for explaining what I need... (see also the attached image).
The customer has several locations around the world. They work with ingredients (to be use in industrial production; to be mixed by some recipe) that may have various names around the globe. Because of that they need a rather simple web application for  knowing what is the name of the ingredient in another location -- possibly trying to unify the names.
There is the internal 
 unique through the company; so, the task can also be formulated to search for the code when one knows the name. It can possibly be the name used in another location.
So far, I display all the rows of the ingredients for all the location. The search panel of the grid view works nicely -- see the picture and notice the very last lines with the code 90002. The last lines show the situation when more locations uses the same ingredient and they mostly use the same name for it.
The user of the application is assigned his/her location code. This way, I would like to display only the rows that are related to the location (in other words, not to clutter the display with the information used in other location.
However, 
, the user should be able to access also the rows from the other locations.
The application is in early stages. So, I can--for example--add a check box like "Show only my location" that would be ignored if the searching was initiated (through some searching event...).
Is there some suitable mechanism built into the ASPxGridView (like any kind of grouping to show preferably only the location row)? Or, should I keep the flat grid-view with the the different data source parameters passed when the searching is started?
 Having deep knowledge of your product, can you suggest the right approach? I do not need anything fancy for the eye. It should be as simple as possible for the user, without the need to explain how it works.
Thanks, and have a nice day,
Petr

dear support,
we have a business requirement to achieve below functionality shown in youtube video.
 how can we best do it in XAF web applications.
if i have to summarize then:
1. data is shown in a gridview
2. on cell click it opens a popup with specific field and control ( it could be textbox, dropdown, depending upon the field).
3. it is not loading whole detail view.
4. it is saving on the fly and refreshing grid without postback.
5. if i pick columns from column chooser, functionality is applicable to any column whihc is editable in DETAILS VIEW.
6. user security permission to be checked , who can and who cannot change the data.
7. all grid operation should work like filter, sort, search etc.
pls advise how best we can do it in XAF web application project.
Thanks

Hello,
in my WIN-XAF-Application  I have dashboard with 2 items. The first item is a combobox, the  second item is a Datagrid. The Datagrid is filled with a stored proc. I need to use the selected value from the Combobox as a parameter for the stored proc. Everytime the value in the Combobox is changed, the data need to be reloaded from the database. How can I do that?
Kind regards

In my previous support ticket I asked how to open a form from a hyperlink on a gridview.  I have that working now, although I need to know how to center the popup form.
Once the popup form is opened, I want to execute some server side code to save the data on the form.  And then close the popup, possibly refreshing the parent gridview.
1. Would I wrap the popup control (in the parent form) in a callback, and then execute the callback from a client-side button click, followed by a popup.Close()?
Would I wrap the gridview in a callback control, and then call the gridview_callback to refresh the grid? 
Do you have an all-purpose sample application that illustrates opening a modal popup, with a Close button that refreshes the parent grid?
TIA,
Miles 

Regarding the Bootstrap Default Upload Control's demo at the following url: 
Can you please explain how to display the uploaded file list that appears after the user has already selected a file and then clicks the upload button.  The uploaded file list in the demo then appears and displays the name of the uploaded file as a hyperlink to the image and the uploaded file's size.  
I can see that there is JS code calling methods on a  dxbsDemo object but what object is that?  I don't see any code in the demo aspx file which adds any type of uploaded files container to that page.  Can you please provide the complete code for a working demo of the Bootstrap Upload Control that includes displaying an uploaded files list?  

As I understand it, SVG support in 17.2.5 should support linear gradients if not radial gradients.
But I cannot get to load a relatively simple 'shelf' SVG image even though I removed the radial gradient it previously had.
The image is public domain and was tweaked using Inkscape as recommended in another SVG ticket.
Everything looks perfect in Inkscape and I can stretch the image horizontally perfectly.
Trying to render it via SvgBitmap gives a "url(#linearGradient326) is not a valid value for Int32" message.
I have attached the svg image source below (it looks very simple - half of it seems to be comments or defaults!) but I don't understand why it isn't treating the colour as a linear gradient
What I need is to be able to get a supported vector image of a 'shelf' (either this one or the one I showed in T597159) either as an SVG file or one directly written using SvgElement/SvgPalette/etc classes so that I can Render bitmaps of various widths.
Please help.

I am using day view with grouped resources and I want the appointments to occupy the whole width of the resource column.
Is there a way to increase the width of the appointment? 

Hi,
I have an application with an asxpscheduler and a aspxgridview displaying and editing the same (appointment) table.
I would like to refresh one control when the other  finishes editing data.
Can you recommend some way(s)  please ?
Thank you  

Hello, I already view

I'm sending you an screen with a mockup...
Best regads,

I have a grid with an unbound column used to display a running total of the Amount column all rows.  This seems to work properly.
However, if I change the sort in the grid, the recalculation of the running total does not trigger.
Can you give me an idea of what I can do to make it trigger when I sort.
TIA
 

I try to add a module to a VB Solution.
When I start the wizard I have no possibility to choose VB.Net. I try to select but it not change from C# to VB. 
I reinstalled Devexpress and try also to another computer. The result is the same: only C# option.
Print screen attached. 

I have a View with multiple TextEdits that are bound to properties of an entity object in my ViewModel.
When saving changes, I'm making an async service call that in case of validation errors returns a ModelState object with a collection of validation errors for each property that failed valication.
What is the correct way to show these validation errors in the View on each TextEdit that failed validation?

I am wondering if there is a way to lock down the dxCalendar to a single month. I am trying to lay out 12 calendar controls to display a whole year so I would like to lock down each of the calendars to a single month so the user cannot swipe accidently. This raises another question. Ath  the moment month + year is displayed in the calendar. Is it possible to adjust the template for this so I display only month since it this form a year would be redundant to repeat.
I am trying to mimic WinForms MonthCalendar control  as I want my user to see the whole year.

Please tell me I'm not crazy....
I have a functioning scheduler in version 17.2.3 with the following included in the scheduler settings:

I am using DevExtreme dxDateBox and I have to use custom date format (dd.mm.yyyy).
As I have learned I must use external libraries like Globalize. I have looked it up and I find it to time consuming and because I am buying DevExtreme I would like to see a simple documentation about it from you and also an example how to use it.
Do you have a simple documentation which explains how to use it and an example.
Thanks, Einar

I there a control or feature that works like the javascript alert(). I am using the javascript alert() function but there is no way to customize it.
I want to use the alert from within EndCallback to display some message like "The record is saved" 
Thanks 

I have a - unfortunately very urgent - issue to report.
I'm using domain components in one of my projects and found a NullReferenceException during my tests.
The issue occurs if you log in with a non-administrator user where during loading of an object with an aggregated list of other business objects (in my example project and order) ServerPermissionRequestProcessor.GetSelectMemberCriteriaCore tries to find the member Implicit_IProject_Orders on IProject which it doesn't find. I tried to track down the origin of that membername and found that higher in the call stack the member must stem from XPClassInfo but ServerPermissionRequestProcessor.GetSelectMemberCriteriaCore tries to find it on ITypeInfo.
I have created a test project with the minimum steps of
1) create xaf web project with complex security (integrated), XPO, no additional modules
2) Create the 2 domain components IProject and IOrder
3) Run the application and let the database be created
4) login as admin, create a project with an order
5) give the default role read and navigate permissions for project and order
6) login as user => NullReferenceException
I'm on 17.2.4 but upgraded to 17.2.5 to check if the error is gone there but no success.
Here is the callstack of the nullreferenceexception before I rollback to 17.2.4 (a very time consuming process)
It's quite important for me to solve this very fast (workaround is ok for me as long as it doesn't have bad side effects). This project is under big pressure.
Thanks a lot!

Hello,
I could not find a full working sample for uploading multiple files in XAF, so I'm trying on my own.
Maybe currently its not the perfect solution, but seems it works almost enough.
But I'm having problems trying to update a nested listview after the FilesUploadComplete() event is called, because it runs outside the View's callback.
Is it possible to generally update the view via client side? Call something in the current view callback manager in an easy form?
=========================
Detailed
=========================
The scenario:
- I've a DetailView for a master object, which contains a NestedListView named Attachments ( IList<Attachment> Attachments )
- now I've created a PropertyEditor (ASPxPropertyEditor, IComplexViewItem) and put it in that DetailView
- this PropertyEditor has an ASPXUploadControl with autoupload active
- on the server, I process that uploader events by saving every file to 'Attachment' domain components [DC] and add it to master collection)
- after the upload returns, the NestListView (Attachments) is not updated with the DCs created on server
I'd like to update that NestedListView so it reflects the Attachment DCs I created in the context of uploader callback.
Is it possible?
=========================
Notes
=========================
Note that I'm *not* saving the objectSpace. It is intended to user manually save at the end
Note that I'd like to handle everything inside the PropertyEditor. By creating a ViewController, for example, will just make it impossible to understand how it works in the future, because related functions are spreaded everywhere.
=========================
Example code
=========================
Below what I've tried (extracted from ):



Hi,
I have a combo box with arrows on either side.  
depending on if the left or right arrow is pressed it increases or decreases the index.
On a IndexChange I then perform a call back for a grid based on the combobbox status.  The problem is when I change the index calling the function 
SetSelectedIndex, it does not fire the  SelectedIndexChanged event;

How do you set up the number of rows and columns in a spreadsheet? For example, I just want to display 100 lines, and other empty lines do not need to be displayed. What should I do? 

I have a dashboard with export function and captions are not displayed.
Please see the attached image. 

Hi there,
In our system we have some code that can dynamically hide or show certain controls on a form  based on a context and I am trying to get it to work for DevExpress components. I want to use LayoutControl items on my form as it seems the easiest and most flexible way to add components, but I noticed a bug where changing a layout item's visibility is actually affecting the visibility of other components on the form!
I was able to reproduce this with the following simple example. I have 2 text edit controls on a form each inside a layout item. I set the visibility of the controls first then go back and set the visibility of the layout item containers based on their control's visibility.
It never gets to the showmessage because the visibility of cxTextEdit1 has been reset after the 3rd line of code!

I have a mvc dashboard with export enabled. 
When selecting Export to PDF and accept the default values and press OK. (attached picture name: Export PDF Option Window)
The export PDF doesn't include X-axis labels from bar chart. 
But if I set/configure some export option values, it displays X-axis labels.
Is there a way to configure these export option values as default values?
 

We have customized Column Chooser but currently it is not showing as pop-up however we want to show it in docked left side to Grid Content. 
Could you please let me know how to achieve this?
 See attached sample screenshot.

Dear Sir/Madam,

Please help. Thanks.

Hi guys,
I am wondering how to do this.  I have a property in my app called LengthOfTime, of type TimeSpan.
00:00:00
I only want the user to be able to enter the "Seconds" of this TextEdit. or SpinEdit.
For instance, if the user clicks in the box and types 14, it will display, "00:00:14"
They can only enter between 0 and 60.
How can I do this and would you have a sample of how to do this?
Thanks much. 

Hi guys,
I have a column in a GridControl of Type TimeSpan.  If it is 00:00:00, I want it to display "Blue" and the font to be 
Bold.  How do I do that.  
I tried this and it does not seem to work.
<dxg:FormatCondition ApplyToRow="False" Expression="[Duration]==00:00:00">
                            <dxg:Format Foreground="Blue" FontWeight="SemiBold"/>
                        </dxg:FormatCondition> 
Am I doing something wrong?  

The office application support the function that user can select some text in other tools(ex: notepad) and drag the text to Excel or Word then Excel or Word will paste the text to place, how to do the same function in GridControl, does Devexpress support this?

Hello,
I have a grid that will display the results of a SQL Query.  I have no control over what the user will run as a SQL select statement.  
When I select from a table with an Image field - (Blob) that is used to contain Text - I only see No Image Data in the grid column.  The attached image shows a split screen between two programs.  
The top gird  shows how I would like it to be displayed.  If there is any data in a Blob field - I would like to display an image in the column - basically showing a document that contains data.  If the field is Null - then I will display a empty document image.  However, the lower part of the image shows what I am currently seeing.  Basically - in the lower part of the image you see how my program currently works.  It shows No Image Data - even if the field is not Null.   This is a little misleading to the user.  
Do you have any thoughts as to how I might do this?  I realize that I will have to check the column type (database or grid?) - and then check if the field is null or not.  Do I change the columns types on the fly?  
I don't suppose you already have a sample of how to do something like this?

I get the following error in my project when I apply this:
ERROR TypeError: e.component.element(...).find is not a function
Any ideas? 
I'm trying this in Angular 5...
element().find is jquery I suppose, not angular 2 or higher, correct?
So it would be nice if you guys provided more angular 2+ samples like this one

Hi, i have a gridcontrol and when put value to numeric column the decimal are not show. By example i read from Access Table A Price=93.12, when put this value to gridview only show 93.   I attache 2 images and one video.

Dear Support, 
I often find this error
 This error comes up when saving. After this error the user can not

Hello 
Using the Dashboard viewer - I am seeing some times when changing a view or loading the dashboard can take a good amount of time (5-10 seconds). This may be partially due to the environment of the machine I am running it on.  At this point I am not too concerned about the time.  However, I would like to provide feedback to the user that there is actually something going on - and they should not be clicking on other buttons, etc.  Perhaps even something as simple as changing the mouse cursor to an hourglass, etc. while the changes are taking place.  
What is the proper way of doing this?  Do I write code in the Loading event of the Dashboard Viewer?   Is there a better place to do this?  
Bradley

I am using Devexpress XtraReports MVC.
Assume I have a Master-Detail report where I list many Orders (Main Report) and Order Details (designed as Subreport).The report layout has the Orders listed and under each order record,  there is a list of Order Details (designed a s Subreport) The report list thousands of oders with 4-5 order details for each order.
I set my own method for
, so I can handle the 
event and do the required jobs. But this event is fired once for the main report and once for the subreport (if the subreport is designed as a seperate report and linked to the main report as a subreport).
I want to ask whether it is possible to call
or other event when a Order Detail is is about to be printed. The reason for this is, I do not want to fetch all the OrderDetail data into memory and let the XtraReports find the correct  Order Details for the Order from the memory but I want it to go to database and fetch the related Order Details and fills the dataset with them. If there is an event for such, I can fill DataSource by myself.
Thanks

Hi
I have a chart with CustomDrawSeriesEventHandler. In the GUI the chart will be show with the right colors. But on mouse over its shows the wrong colors (see attached picture).
The second problem is, on export to excel the colors are wrong also (see attached excel).
Here my code:
        public ActionResult APQPOverYear(UIChart sendObject)
        {
            LoadByAPQPStateOverYear(sendObject);
            return CheckUserAccess(View(sendObject), AppAccessRoles.RoleReportComplex);
        }
        public ActionResult ExportAPQPOverYear(UIChart sendObject)
        {
            LoadByAPQPStateOverYear(sendObject);
            var compositeLink = new CompositeLink(new PrintingSystem());
            var chartHelper = new BarChartHelper();
            var settings = chartHelper.ChartSettings(sendObject);
            PrintableComponentLink linkBar = GetPrintableChart(settings, sendObject.ChartData);
            compositeLink.Links.Add(linkBar);
            compositeLink.CreateDocument();
            MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
            compositeLink.PrintingSystem.ExportToXlsx(stream);
            stream.Position = 0;
            FileStreamResult result = new FileStreamResult(stream, "application/xlsx");
            result.FileDownloadName = "APQPStateOverYear.xlsx";
            return result;
        }
In the methode LoadByAPQPStateOverYear(sendObject) i set the CustomDrawSeriesEventHandler:
        private void LoadByAPQPStateOverYear(UIChart vm)
        {
            vm = vm ?? new UIChart();
            vm.InitLookups(m_db);
            vm.StateLookup = m_db.MetaState.ToList().PrestaMetaLocalized(CultureHelper.GetCurrentNeutralCulture(), false);
            vm.ChartWidth = 1200;
            vm.CustomDrawSeriesBar = (s, e) => ChartController.CustomDrawSeriesBarAPQPState(s, e, vm.StateLookup);
The EventHandler:
        public static void CustomDrawSeriesBarAPQPState(object sender, CustomDrawSeriesEventArgs e, List<DCMetaState> states)
        {
            // These changes will be applied to Bar Series only.
            BarDrawOptions drawOptions = e.SeriesDrawOptions as BarDrawOptions;
            if (drawOptions == null)
                return;
            // Get the fill options for the series point.
            drawOptions.FillStyle.FillMode = FillMode.Gradient;
            RectangleGradientFillOptions options =
            drawOptions.FillStyle.Options as RectangleGradientFillOptions;
            if (options == null)
                return;
            // Get the value at the current series point.
            var label = e.Series.Name;
            var state = states.Where(x => x.Title == label).FirstOrDefault();
            var Ldraw = e.LegendDrawOptions as BarDrawOptions;
            Ldraw.FillStyle.FillMode = FillMode.Solid;
            if (state != null)
            {
                Ldraw.Color = ColorTranslator.FromHtml(state.Color);
                options.Color2 = ColorTranslator.FromHtml(state.Color);
                drawOptions.Color = Color.FromArgb(150, options.Color2);
                drawOptions.Border.Color = Color.FromArgb(100, 39, 91, 1);
            }
        }
If i load the GUI the methode for the CustomDrawSeriesEventHandler will be called. On the export, the handler is set, but the methode will not be called??
You have any idea?
Best regards
Andreas

I was update my DevExpress components, and have many problems
One of them:
in old version I used DevExpress.ExpressApp.Web.ShowViewStrategy.CollectionsEditMode
((ShowViewStrategy)base.ShowViewStrategy).CollectionsEditMode = ViewEditMode.Edit; 
but in new version   DevExpress.ExpressApp.Web.ShowViewStrategy.CollectionsEditMode is obsolete.
How can I do it in new version?

Hello,
I am currently styling an WPF app with Theme designer and would make a suggestion to show an open button near the element path.
Like:
"UICore\VS2017Dark\Shapes_Base.xaml"  | Button icon
Button should open the selected file in the editor and ideally the right line number as well. It's kind of tricky to navigate to that path as you can't just copy-paste it to explorer.
At least one should be able to open the right folder from the designer.
Also, it is unnecessary to open Visual Studio to edit the file so an editor selection would be nice (I prefer VS Code or Notepad++ for small tasks).
See pict.

I am using repx files for developing reports for our customers.
As I do in Visual Studio on changing source code I would like to compare my changes made in the reports before I send  them to the customers.
 
As you can see in attached screenshot my versioning System (Microsoft Visual SourceSafe)  does not Show any source Code to compare differences.
It shows many changes although I opened and saved file without making any changes. 
Do you provide any possibility to save reports  with readable source Code?

Hello,
as you can see in the image, there are two nulls value in the chart (in date 01/01/2014 and 01/01/2015) and the chart display  a line like image a. Is it possbile to display a line like image b? In Excel chart I remember o property like "Link null value"..
Tks. 

Hi there
Is it possible to change the horizontal alignment of the "Save Changes" / "Cancel Changes" links to be left aligned (in stead of right aligned)?
Thanks!


This is a two part question but since they both revolve around disabling dates and times I think they can be asked together in the same ticket. Feel free to separate them if you think it's necessary.
This basically continues the first question but this time it is about times. So I would like to know if times can be disabled when dxDateBox type is set to "time". When I get the time picker, or whatever else I am getting depending on the theme, I want to disable certain times so I cannot pick them at all. An example would be same as above but with accent on working hours. If a shop is opened from 08:00 in the morning untill 04:00 in the afternoon I would like all other times to be grayed out(unselectable) or not available at all. For this matter I would also like to know if min and max can work for times as well.

I've recently upgraded from v16 to v17.4 and I'm receiving numerous exception reports from different users, clearly related to the DevExpress components. These exceptions seem random and affect different users, with no clear way to reproduce them.
The intention of this message double:
1. To provide DevExpress with any piece of feedback that may lead to solving these problems, even when it's not very specific
2. Ask for some kind of general solution to catch these exceptions and gather better information about the scenario.
I was thinking of having a chart, grid and pivotgrid descendant that may catch these exceptions, log them in more detail and be able to reload itself, since the reports I get are sent when my whole app crashes.
I have more trace information on each one of them, but I think that the relevant parts are what I paste below:

Dear,
I've an  ASPxGridView with image in GridViewDataImageColumn.
I can't set width of column because I'm using adaptive layout.
But, on some device, the  image become very very little.
Can I set  width of image in GridViewDataImageColumn without set width of column ?
Thanks,

Hi,
i?m using the ListBoxEdit in a context menu and wondering how to achieve the expandable grouping as documented in your online documentation at

I tried some of the available customizations but did not succeed yet ...
Can you give me a hint?
thx in advance 

Hi guys,
We are facing another odd problem now with logging in app.
We set TraceLogLocation to CurrentUserApplicationFolder value. In sample project log is stored into odd folder  AppData\Local\-\<App_Name> instead of into AppData\Local\<App_Name> folder. More over application must be run as an administrator to be able to create this log folder.
In our Main app otherwise we have diffferent problem - no matter if we run app with admin permissions or not we are unable to find log at all with TraceLogLocation=CurrentUserApplicationDataFolder. I can not find any mention about breaking change of this behavior in your documentation thus I am not sure if you forget to mention it or if there is some problem related to new updates to windows 10 or just some bug created by mistake.
Use case:
- Run Visual Studio as Admin (when I don't run app with admin permissions I can not find log at all)
- run the application
- look into AppData\Local\ there should be new folder with name "-" and inside it there is <App_Name> folder (in our case CurrentUserApplicationDataFolderProblem folder)
P.S.: Just little fix into your 
 there you tell in text we should set CurrentUserApplicationDataFolder into TraceLogLocation but in code example you add ApplicationFolder value into TraceLogLocation it is quite confusing.
Thanks a lot for advice. 

Hi,

Thanks for the info. Both a textarea and standard TextBox-component works perfectly with Codemirror.
Unfotunately not so well with ASPxMemo . Start position of the cursor is not placed in the top after a resize of the ASPxMemo-component and the font is not displayed as expected.
Any recommendations/example how to make existing ASPxMemo-components to work with Codemirror?


If the Annotations are defined with dates that are close enough there will be annotations "Colliding" with each other; that is, Annotations will overlap and when they overlap they become difficult to read. What guidance if any can you provide in predetermining when items overlap?
Your help here would be much appreciated.
That said, I believe this ticket can be closed as resolved.
Thanks for your assistance.

How can I do this?

Hi guys,
I have a question. We had a problem with storing Log into correct folder, even when we set in TraceLogLocation  CurrentUserApplicationFolder value log was always stored into application folder.
We found the reason. Reason was that we did not call Tracing.Initialize method thus OutputDirectory was always called using PathHelper and settings stored in Config were ignored.
So my question is - is really neccessary to always call Tracing.Initialize method wouldn't it better to always use for initializing OutputDirectory value from config instead of PathHelper. Code where OutputDirectory is initialized using PathHelper is in OutputDirectory field's getter. 
So now i don't know if it is bug or feature - I think this approach you use is because of web app though.
Thanks for answer. 

Hello,
          I have a custom class named as 
. I am binding the list of this class to treelist view through BindingSource. But i want to tag the each value in the bindinglist to the treelist node. So how to achieve this ?

I am using day view grouped be resources.
Is there a way to customize the color of the appointments. I do not want to use the color of the resource but I want to specify different colors for appointments under the same resource.
 

When I set a column GroupInterval (I tried on Date field with DateMonth and DateYear group interval) the Property 'Get' method fires for all the records even if the column is hidden and the record is  not visible.
The problem was not present in the version 16.2.4
Thanks
  

Hello there, I have yet again another issue with the MVVM framework that I need your expertise with.
We have a project with views and view models created by the WPF Scaffolding Wizard.
In the detail view / single object view for an entity, there are some (string) properties where we want to provide suggestions in a ComboBoxEdit or similar. These suggestions should be all distinct values that are used for this property.
In one case, we want those only as suggestions and the user is able to  enter a different value, in the other case the user can only choose from  those values. This should replace the standard text edit control generated for this strign property.
For example, if there are 4 entities of class Component with a property "Material", with 3 having material "Wood" and 1 having "Metal", we want a combo box containing the two entries "Wood" and "Metal".
I tried adding a LookUpMaterial property to my view model that returns the result of "GetLookUpProjectionsViewModel", following examples on 
, but the combobox was either empty or contained only one element. I could just use a List<String> that is a result of a simple LINQ query, but that didn't get updated when new values were added.
Thank you!

Dear all
I have an issue with the TcxGrid and i have attached a screenshot to show my problem.
The grid has 65 records and  Grid.DataController.recordCount = 65.  An access error randomly occures  at  the  the line :

What do i do wrong ?
Thank in  advance for your help.
 

Good morning.
We are considering using Test Caf?.
I see that the current DevExpress has not been update for a long time (although is the one linked on your site) because you have a new one: 
Will the new one replace totally the existing one? Is the new one ready to use?
In the new page it says it is free and open source. Will the full product will be free or there will be a free version and a paid version with additional features?
Regards

Hello there, How do I get the selected filter list in a filter field in the CxdbpivotGrid component? 

Hi,
I am using Angular 4.3.4 with Typescript. Using the npm package devextreme-angular @ 17.1.6.
In our product we have dynamically generated pie charts, which I have working fine.
However, when a user clicks on a segment of the pie chart, it should show a popover and display a specific component inside.  I've seen the 'onPointClick' event which works fine, however I am unsure on how to create and display the popover while creating a component within it and passing through data.
Any help would be appreciated.
Cheers,

With 96 PPI the MiniToolBar is always very well split in two rows. At 144 PPI all items are on in one row!
To reproduce just add a bunch of standard button in a MiniToolBar (i always use a MTB together with a PopUp menu).
I found a reason/fix in your code:
function TdxRibbonMiniToolbarControl.GetPopupSize: TSize;
   Result := GetSizeForHeight(dsNone, ScaleFactor.Apply(IfThen(cxIsTouchModeEnabled, 75, 50)), True);
50(75) scaled up to 144 PPI -> 75(112) seems to be to small. To split on the rows with 144 PPI the height should at least 80.
Thus i tried this, and it works very well - at least for 96 and 144 PPI:
 
   Result := GetSizeForHeight(dsNone, ScaleFactor.Apply(IfThen(cxIsTouchModeEnabled, 80, 55)), True);
(I did not the with TouchMode enabled!)

Hello,
I am using the dxScheduler in a hotel application. For my program an appointment is a hotel reservation.
I am using the Timeline View of scheduler. Usually the resources are the hotel rooms and don't fit in a screen. So I have activated the vertical scroll bars.
The problem is when  resizing the resources height, appointments are "hiding", without any warning!
I have tried to use the technique from this issue,
but this is not working in my case.
Obviously the code in the issue, assumes no vertical scroll bars.
It will be nice for the dxScheduler control, to inform about the missing appointments. This is very frustrating behavior, no error, no warning, just appointments missing. A User can never be sure, if all appointments are shown, or not!
Please provide some help about this issue.
It would be nice if the control had a method to inform about "missing" appointments.
Thanks!

Hi,
     Required detailed sample code for pivot grid with settings of options filtering data, charts, export , grouping , summing the data total. 

I asked a question before for showing error message when any error appears, check it 
.
How to apply this same behavior  to dynamic grid control?
 

I'm using two 
and two 
into one Angular component (with Visual Studio 2017 on a Asp Net Core 2.0 project) and I need to export all this grids into one single xls file. Is it possible?
If it's possible, can you provide me an example  (if possible also insert a header before each table)?
Thanks.

I've added an icon ID to an ASPxButton but when I tried to set the image width to a larger value,
more than one icon appeared which is weird.
I've attached how it looks like.
Below is my code :
<dx:ASPxButton ID="btnLogIn" runat="server" Text="Log In" CssClass="SignInButton" AutoPostBack="true" OnClick="btnLogIn_Click" Image-IconID="businessobjects_bouser_32x32" Image-Width="100"></dx:ASPxButton>
 Why is that happening ?

I am calling ZoomToFitLayerItems on a winforms map control from a layer's DataLoaded event.  This is working fine except that I want to export to an image once it is completed and the  ZoomToFitLayerItems  appears to also be asynchronous.
I have tried hooking into the ViewportChanged event but whilst this seems to fire many times it does not seem to fire when the zoom has completed rendering entirely.
Is there a way to capture some sort of ZoomToFitLayerItems OnCompleted event?

Hi!
I'm looking for a solution to implement business logic in the datacelltemplate method. The issue is that I need to get data in an async call before the business logic is implemented (remote data), so I need to make sure the data is available in the datacelltemplate method. I'm running the angular (angular2) version. But the datacelltemplate is run very early before I have time to make the call to remote server.
Is it any way to make an async call before datacelltemplate is rendered by promise of some kind? The only option I can think of is to make the async call and then force update by using repaint-method. But that forces a refresh in the datasource as well. Sounds like a poor solution.

If I use standard TPrintDialog of delphi I see my redirected printer but passing PrinterIndex to dxPrintDevice I have an error Printer Index Out of Range.
 
Can you help me ?
Thanks


Hello!
I have another issue with the CustomDrawColumnHeader and CustomDrawBandHeader, where i simply would like to change the background color, but it seems that this is overridden by some standard - Handler. 
In general I would like to avoid to set handled to true and implement all the drawing myself...

So i trying to show some data in a pivot grid.
The problem is that the value fields are not editable.
I looked around and found some other tickets but its not clear for me how i am supposed to go about the issue.
One of them : 
The thing is that i want to be able to do this in xaf asp .
From what i understand i would ne ed to have a view controller for the list view where i have the pivot grid, access the pivot grid editor and then add and editor for the value field, and handle the valuechange event.
So i get the editor like this :
if ((View as ListView).Editor is ASPxPivotGridListEditor)
{
    pivotGrid = ((ASPxPivotGridListEditor)(View as ListView).Editor).PivotGridControl;
}
Now how to add the editor ?! 

Hi Andrey,
Thanks for providing the solution. 
It meets my  requirement.
Just wonder to know how to display the float window at the center and block the background for being accessible when it is in float state.
Thanks,

Hi support team,
I am using PersistentAlias in my domain object and I am viewing it with several persitent objects in a grid bound to the table through a xpServerCollectionSource - so we are using the grid in server mode.
However, once I am creating a group summary over this specific persistent alias and show it in the footer, I get an empty grid.
Is this one of the feature limitations of server mode? For unbound columns I can understand this feature limitation, but for persistent alias-fields, I thought this would be a way to calculate values on server side, so a summary on server side should be possible as well.
Here is my persistent alias defintion:

Good morning.
I need to equivalency to:
 1. DbGridTableView.FocusedField   (I need to get the focused field )
 2. DbGridTableView.FocusedField.DataType (I need to get the focused field your data type field )
 3. DbGridTableView.FocusedField.DisplayName(I need to get the focused field your display name field )
 4. DbGridTableView.FocusedField.Strings(I need to get the focused field your values of field )
 5. DbGridTableView.FocusedColumn(I need to get the focused column )
 6. In DbGridTableView get Property of Column cell for readonly
The old version in delphi was TdxDBGrid <---> TcxGridDBTableView (new version)
thanks

Hi,
I have used the Scaffolding Wizard to setup the Views and ViewModels but I would like to pass a variable or parameter when opening an entity from a gridview list (see image attached). Sorry if I`m not explaining myself properly.
There is a command .....Application6.HHH.ViewModels.XYZCollectionViewModel), "New", this.bbiNew).... but I`m not sure how to pass on another value.
Thank you

Hi, guys
I have a problem with DevExpress SpellChecker component. I need to have the spell check for a bunch of controls on my form. I cannot use "check all controls in the parent container" option, because some of that controls must be spell-checked and other must not.
So I create N spell-checkers on the form and this works fine.
The problems start when I put my controls on TabControl element. The controls on first tab page are checked correctly and the controls on second tab page are not checked at all.
I just made a simple test with latest version of DevExpress 17.2.5.0 (originally appeared in 16.2.3.0). The same problem.
I tried standard TabControl+TextBox (System.Windows.Forms) and XtraTabControl+XtraEditors.TextEdit. The same problem.
What should I do in order to make spell-checkers work correctly at all tab pages of TabControl? Is it my bug or your one? Can you propose me a workaround?
Have a nice day

Hello 
I am tying to manage devexpress spreadsheet module in my project.

  Check specified Employees by clicking on Employee's Checked row or by clicking on a whole project (in this case all Employees inside this Project must be checked automatically)
When user checks all Employees, Project must be checked (Checked column)
When user clicks OK button, all the selected Employees must be displayed
  
  When I check Project (Checked column), I need to collapse and expand child table with Employees to repaint it with new values
If I change the Checked state of Employee, I must focus Projects row to repaint and refresh Project checked status
When I select for example two Employees in one project and press OK, I see only one of them, even if unfocused Employee row before (Projects Checked column was updated)
If I select Project, all Employees are selected, but when I click OK button, I dont see it in results list
  
  


Hello Uriah,
I found the wanted labels, but something is wrong.
If I choose the 'Non Translated' filter, there is no hit at all.
If I choose the 'Your Translations' filter, it will only find one - but not the Hungarian translation.
If I choose 'All' filters, then several new lines will appear - but not the Hungarian translation.

Is there any limitations on batch edit or fixed style with horizontal scroll?
Please see the attached video. The horizonal scroll is correctly displayed, however the user cannot move left-right by clicking the mouse wheel.
If you try to move left or right nothing happens. When you try to move in diagonal, for example right and upper, the grid correctly moves up, and the headers of the grid starts moving. However when you stop moving, the grid has correctly move up, but not right.

I have a large Data Grid that seems to hit some kind of limitation on the API side when grouping in several levels 
~ 25 columns, grouping in 3 or 4 levels.
Depending on amount of data rows, returns 404 Not found from the API.
It looks like  there is some kind of limitation that DataSourceLoadOptions loadOptions can handle?

Hello,
In some cases the ALT-Key seems to get stuck in the Ribbonmenu.
The focus is in a TextEdit, that contains text, and you press ALT-TAB to switch to another application (e.g. Chrome-Browser) to copy some text from there.
When you come back to our application the RibbonMenu behaves as if the ALT-Key is pressed although it's not. We managed to get rid of this behaviour, bei raising a KeyUp for Keys.Menu  when Activating the RibbonForm, but thats like treating the symptoms not the cause of the problem.
Any ideas on how not to run into this?

Hi,
I am having an issue since my last update to 17.2.4...
 I have a small app where I change connection string to an application... However from update when I try to notify user I have an error of "Layout measurement override of element 'DevExpress.Xpf.LayoutControl.LayoutGroup' should not return NaN values as its DesiredSize."
Worst than that... is...
If I set showNotification at begin of command without anything else it fires ok.
However if I trigger it in body of command... I have that exception.... 
Can you help undestand how so?
I am attaching this project...

Hi
There is a bug in Pivot Grid exporting.
It's generating data only for first page.
The same bug is in Your example
Please give me info when this issue will be resolved
This is very important for us and Our clients because this is major functionality of our application.
 

Dear DevExpress support,
In our application we use the propertygridcontrol without vertical lines, but we still want to use a border....
But with border, the rowlines makes the Top-border extra thick. I attached a sample to show the dilemma.
I tried to place the control on a panel control, with negative locations based on BorderlineWidth, but it will be a lot of plumbing and unpredictable results if RowLineWidths and other layoutsettings are changing.
Is there a solution ?
With greetings, Ton.

When using filters based on a suffix with wildcard (i.e. not just an extension), it seem to ignore the extra information.  A sample is as follows:
            using (XtraOpenFileDialog of = new XtraOpenFileDialog())
            {
                of.Filter = "Archives (*.project.7zip,*.project.txt)|*.project.7zip;*.project.txt";
                of.ShowDialog();
                return of.FileName;
            }
This results incorrectly in all TXT and 7ZIP files being listed - ignoring the "project" component of the filter.
:  Using the standard OpenFileDialog works.

I have a ListView that has it's DataAccessMode set to Server because of a larger dataset in the list.
The objects have a compound key, therefor a TypeConverter has been used to get the selection column to show. (
)
To be able to change the select all checkbox to select all on page the solution has been converted from 14.1 to 16.1 (
)
The problem I have now is that when I select a row or select all rows on the page the page is reloaded and the selection is gone.
When I switch the DataAccessMode to client (to test) the page is also reloaded but than the selection remains.

Hello,
what is the right way to change edit value of a bounded TextEdit in a custom edit form using code?
For example i want to change the edit value using the closed event of a checked combobox in the same form:
sub cbx_closed(...) Handles cbx.closed
 TextEdit.editvalue = "test"
end sub
The edit value is changed in this example. But clicking on the "update" button in the custom edit form has no effect for the bounded record.
Entering a value manualy in this TextEdit and clicking "update" works ...
thanks again for help
Michael

Hi,
We are suffering with devexpress control every time.  Custom control should make developer life easier but devexpress makes complex. If I want to validate some value for a textedit during lost focus then devexpress provides us multiple ways that confused us:
1. LostFocus  event
2. LostKeyboardFocus event
3. LostMouseCapture event
4. IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged event
 1. LostFocus  event: when we use it, it fires when we click the red cross icon (default close button of a form) and do the validation which is not expected. As I want to close the form so I expect no validation will be executed.
2. LostKeyboardFocus event: it fires 4/5 times. After searching this issue on devexpress support center, devexpress suggests us to use IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged event as below
private void txtSigCode_IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged(object sender, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)
{
    if ((bool)e.NewValue == false)
    {
       // do the validation 
    }
}
4. IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged event: for this event, we are facing issue as well. I have used Ribbon control so when I got focus on textedit and then I try to open another form from Ribbon menu, it fires the validation as focus is lost. Also when I click default close button of a form then the validation is fired. As DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs has only bool OldValue and bool NewValue, so I am unable to identify where is the next focus is. If I could identify then I could solve my issue. 
So please provide me a good solution 
Thanks
Khabir

I am upgrading our software from using v13.2 to v17.1.6 and have encountered the problem of combining two reports using XtraReport.Pages.AddRange(); see the attached code snippet. The first report is in portrait mode and the second report to combine is in landscape mode. This worked fine in v13.2, but after upgrading to v17.1.6, only the first report is display in the print preview and printed to the printer. The second report is fine when preview / printed by itself. I have even tried to using the code example of the merging of the two reports in your documentation, but still only the first report is preview / print.
Thanks for your assistance. 

I have a GridView whith DetailRow, so when a determinated group of user open the page some columns are hided.

See attached my call stack.
Maybe you have an idea what could be the problem here.

Hello Support,
In gridview we are trying to get summary of a column and its coming also but not properly. Kindly check screen shot . We wanted column SUM total to come below particular column. 

When doing a search in the FindPanel via the Enter key,
FindPanel applies the filter an then sends VK_RETURN to the underlying control.
Is this behaviour by design? Other action keys are set to 0 afterwards.
Why not:
Now FindPanel "disturbs" the key handling in the underlying form.
In the underlying form i would like to do something like this
How can i detect whether FindPanel has sent VK_RETURN?

Hello DevExpress-Team,
our most recent use case is to format the datagrid by rows instead of columns. 
We are already colorizing the cells by the given data from the datasourcen within the onCellPrepared event, however, we are not able to set a specific formatter on the cells/rows.
We already tried to set the element.value, element.text and element.displayValue properties without any success.
How can we accomplish this case?

I put one ASPxSpinEdit in the ASPxGridView DataItemTemplate.

I would like help in this regard.
The application is a basket application.
Thank you.

Hello,
Is there a way to change the focused row from Javascript, or at least remove the focus?
I have an app which needs to update the focused row according to the result of an AJAX call, but I can't figure out how to do that.
I've read about row handles but I couldn't find a clear example.
Is there a way to do this on the client side with Javascript?
Thank you in advance,
Michele

Hi,
I have  a problem with the subject. I attached the project to demonstrate this behaviour. Just run the app and you will see DockLayoutManager with some LayoutGroups and LayoutControlItems. The group with the caption "Zakladni informace F1" has two colums (implemented by another LayoutGroups without caption). It seems that items in second column have different LayoutInterval for some reason, which is a litle mystery for me. I am sorry, I have tried to simpilify the example more, to create layout directly in the XAML itself, create groups with colums with different count of items, but I did not capable to reproduce this behaviour, so finally I saved layout from our original application and this is loaded to the DockLayoutManager in the sample. 
Very thanks for help,
Mira

Hi ,
I have a form layout   with two objects. The valdiati?on is working for this item 
But not working for this item 
The validation groups are the same. What am i doing wrong ?  I am attaching the page  and this my screencast
 



How can I make a linechart, that is beging updated every 5 seconds with data, and where the points staying at the same place. So (see image below) when a point (ie 15:30:00) is on position 1, point 2 (ie 15:30:05) is in position 2 and the next point will come in position 3. And then when the graph is filled, point one will only be visible when you scroll.

Hi,
I have developed a dashboard view on an asp page.  The web page with the dashboard is working fine in my VS IDE environment.
The dashboard is saved in the folder ~/App_Data/.
When deployed in a IIS the dashboard is missing in the web page.  The error "An error has occurred on an attempt to load the list of available dashboards". 
Where did I went wrong?
Cheers,
Peter 

Hello,
when exporting a dashboard that is featuring a date range filter, the option to output a filter summary  prints the range "off-by-one".  
In the example, the date range filter is configured to use the group interval "month-year", the filter is set May 2015 - Dec 2019
In the exported PDF, the range is printed correctly. The filter summary, however, prints Apr 2015 - Nov 2019.
Digging through the export process, I found that the request passed to "PerformExportAction" contains
 "RangeLeft": "2015-04-30T22:00:00.000Z",
 "RangeRight": "2019-11-30T23:00:00.000Z",
So maybe some kind of time zone issue is involved? (Germany ->  UTC+1)

I've spent all day so far trying to achieve what frankly should be out of the box functionality!
I want to save a grid control's layout to a single file. End user's cannot be expected to save separate files for the main view and every detail view in the grid control.
I have worked through you documentation and dozens of posts dating back over six years  and I cannot this working.
Attached is a  modified sample of yours  where I'm trying to use the recommended method. I want it to work how the normal separate file export works but to create a single file.
The sample only contains 1 grid but this shouldn't matter to get it working.
Test steps
1: Run progam
2: Drag columns a, b, and c out of the grid (hiding them)
 3: Click the save button
4: Close and reopen program
5: Click the load button
6: See how the columns that should be hidden are not hidden but are moved. 

Hello,
I created a mvc project where I have a page with a gridview and scheduler. The gridview contains some unplanned items and can be planned by dragging the item to the scheduler. This is working nicely but the problem is that sometimes the grid is not correctly refreshed. When I set brakepoints in the controller I can see that the callback to refresh the grid is done before the callback to insert the appointment. Therefore the data is still unplanned and thus showing in the grid.
I don't see a way to influence the execution order of the callbacks so I tried to use the OnSuccess functionality of the performcallback command. This however does not seem to be working. I tried to execute the 'gridview.PerformCallback()' in the OnSuccess but the breakpoint in the controller was never hit. Also the console.log method is not writing anything.
On the support center I found 
 ticket where a simular problem was reported for the cardview component but this should be solved in my version.
Javascript to drop the appointment:



Controller code:



Can you please provide me with a solution for this?

Hi,
 
In DevExpress 15.2 SNAP functionality we've noticed weird behavior in how the images are saved in Snap Document WordML.
 
When the SNAP application is build and running in x64 mode (please not that this behavior is not reproducible on x86), every time document is saved, the base64 bytes of image saved in WordML change despite the fact image was not changed on document. The easiest way to reproduce it is:
1. Create new SNAP document
2. Add any image
3. Save the document.
4. Save the wordML file using snapControl.Document.GetWordMLText method
5. add a line of text to the document
6. Save document again
7. Save the wordML again. The wordML file created in #4 differs by a few bytes (a few characters in base64string) in the image/picture xml tag.
Is there any way to make it work the same as x86 version where file bytes/base64string are not changed?
Thank you.

Hello DevExpress,
I inherited a project developed eXpressAppFramework, but I can't find >
How can I add column summary like: Total Sum of column, Average Sum of column and etc.  in grid's footer like on screenshot which I applied.

Hello,
(please find attached my example project) .

Hello,
I have a dxScheduler with an initial dataSource empty (dataSource: null).
I would like to populate the scheduler with data depending on a select option, with the following Javascript:
const myScheduler = document.getElementById("scheduler");
fetch(calendarDataUrl).then(data => {
        return data.json();
    }).then(result => {
        // the refresh of scheduler data here
        myScheduler. ????????

What is the best way to populate the scheduler with the newly fetched data?
A related question, we would like to re-populate another scheduler with newly fetched monthly data on a month-change click event. How could this be accomplished?
NB! We are using straight Javascript/jQuery, no Angular.

jquery@3.2.1
typescript@2.6.2
We have an app which uses the many of the dx-angular components throughout, but in atleast one section we will need the dynamism of the jquery version since the page will be database driven and I don't want a thousand line template to account for all the variations.  To do this, I have created a component in which I am attempting to create a data grid from a div and getting the error "$(...).dxDataGrid is not a function".  The confusing thing is that I can execute the line in the Chrome dev console with no error, but any normal execution of the code results in the error.
In the component, I'm importing dx.all, 
 I'm referring to the element via ViewChild,
 ...and executing the dg creation in ngAfterViewInit.  
I also tried ngOnInit and in a timeout, but I get the same result each time.
I also tried referring to the dist/js/dx.all.js in the angular-cli.json right after the jquery reference, but that didn't seem to change anything.
Thoughts?  Suggestions?

Hello the present question is linked to the previous one we had regarding the enability of Copy/Paste in the RibbonItem.
It appears the IsEnabled property of the different RibbonItems  is not linked to the IsEnabled property of their PopupMenuItem counterpart.
In our case the copy and paste buttons are still available through the PopUp menu of the  spreadsheet.
Is it the standard behavior  for the frameworks to separate the states of the Ribbon and PopUp buttons even if they are linked to the same action ?

Hello,
I used with your control propertyGrid and I bound control list to the selected object property and everything works well,  perfectly.
I have problem that my application works slowly.
During The application life the control list is changed a lot of times, and I found that when I canceled the binding (of the control list to the propertyGrid control)
the application worked quickly.
Do you have any solution for me, how can I use with the propertyGrid and change the list wich is bind to it and the application will continue to work quickly.
thanks

Hi, I would like to know if would be possible to initialize AspxDateEdit Calendar on  year Navigation, 
In case of BirthDate infact, is difficult to navigate from null or today date to birthDate. 
Would be more confortable to start with decade or century  selection and the by simply clicks jump to year, month and finally day.
Is it possible?
Thank you 

I am unable to figure out via the website, documentation and random attempts on how to change the column caption that is empty above Edit and Delete action links when Updating and Deleting are enabled.
<dxo-editing mode="row" [allowUpdating]="true" [allowDeleting]="true"></dxo-editing>
Currently this column has an empty value and  I have a requirement to have the column have a caption of "Action".  Can you please show me where to look to find how to set this value?

Hi, I have a search panel in my gridview.
If I search for some text and leave my page, when I come back using the browser's back button I find the gridview not filtered and the search panel containing the text previosly searched.
This would not be a problem, but if I type another text or if a try to clear the panel, an error occours.
what is the best approach to avoid this behavior?
you can find attached an example.
Thank you as always for your support.

Hi!
We have  a GridControl bound to a XPCollection of XPO Entity (Oracle table 'Import_Mapping').
One column is bound to a firm using Combobox. 
A second column shall be bound to contacts, using Combobox, too.
The problem is that depending on the selected firm, the list of available contacts must be build.
We could implement that for visibility with GridColumn.CellTemplate, but we cannot change and store the contact.
How to do that? How to define the EditTemplate?
 

Hi
How do I prevent a WPF grid cell that is not editable from getting an editor so that it doesn't respond  to any key presses?  The documentation says that setting AllowEdit to false achieves this, but it turns out to be yet another fiction.  Is there some obscure setting that has nothing to do with a cell being editable that will disable the editor entirely?
Thanks

After upgrade from 16.2.6 to 17.1.9, saving grid changes when using batch edit mode + cell edit mode causes the page to scroll to the bottom of the page. Previous behaviour was that the scroll position was untouched, and the user could continue working without losing context.
It seems like the pager at the bottom potentially receives focus, and is then scrolled into view.
Is this a known issue, and is there a workaround?
We'd rather not downgrade to 16.2.6 since we have tested the system using this version. For the same reason, we'd rather not upgrade to a later version.
Best regards 

Hi,
I got a Pivotgrid with a TrackBar as RepositoryItem. I need to set the Trackbar Properties: TickFrequency, LargeChange and SmallChange based on my underlying objects data.

HI,
How do we setup and ASPxCardView with adaptivity so that the number of cards displayed are affected by the screen width so that no more cards are displayed than can fit the screen? We can only find how to decide when a single card collapses into single column width.
What we want to achieve is that the number of cards shown are only what can fit the screen, and that a single card only collapses to singe width when it is the only card displayed and even then can't fit the screen.
Thanks.

I have a problem with the XtraReports localization.
I need to generate reports in different languages depending on the user settings, I have all our reports localized, some of the report's labels need to change its text depending on the data, so we have created some DetailReportBand.BeforePrint events that assign these texts , these texts are also localized in an external resource file.
Before creating the report I set the CurrentThread.CurrentCulture to english for example, then I create the report and load the binded data. The report is shown mainly in english, but the labels whose text has been changed in this BeforePrint events are shown in spanish, so I have report with mixed languages.
I've set a breakpoint in the BeforePrint event, and I noticed the CurrentThread.CurrentCulture has changed back to spanish ( my UI language ). In my code the CurrentThread.CurrentCulture is not changed anywhere else, so I don't know why the currentculture is being changed before executing the events.
How can I solve this?
Thanks.

Hi there,
I would like to know if there is a way to display two icons/images in one single cell (XtraGrid GridView). 
Our use case is that a value in a cell is determined by two properties, each of which can be expressed by an icon that we have in our app. We would like to display those two icons in the cell. 
It works nicely with one image using the RepositoryItemImageComboBox. Is there a way to make it work for two images? Or do you know of a workaround to implement this feature?
Thanks for your help,
Kind Regards,

Hi
I would like to use the autofilter row  for the resource tree.
So, I used the following  code:
 
But, as you can see on the attached screenshot, I only have the options "Equal" and "Not Equal".
If I try to set the filter through the FilterEditor, I also find no "Contains".
Are there any limitations to this "contains"-option? 
btw:
The property "GanzerName"  is of type string.

I had a display bug. If the page is without scrolling (the height of the table is less than the height of the screen) it will display correctly and if the page appears scrolling the last column will be shift and if there is data it won't be visible. The same bug is observed not only in the tables but also in the other widgets. 
i found only the one solution with refresh after define time interval but i think it's not good enough.
  

Hi,
when i'm using your ListBoxEdit with a ItemTemplate, it seems like it retains a reference to the last window.
I have created a sample to illustrate this, everytime you click show it will allocate 25MB of data and when the window closes it should be freed, there is also a GC button to force garbage collection.
Now after closing all the windows and looking with jetbrains dotmemory I see that  it gives a warning about a memory leak with the class DevExpress.Xpf.Editors.Helpers.LocalVisibleListWrapper<T> and the memory is indeed not released.
The warning is about the WPF Collection Binding Leak.
I have two links explaining this.
Kind Regards,

I have a tabbed group item and a group item in two different partial views being shown on the same view. I am calling both partials in the view with the .SetNestedContent(partialViewName). I want these items to align but the group item seems to have more padding then the tabbed group item. How could I go about aligning these items

We are having troubles to automatically have the focus set back to the dropdown list, when selecting a value from the dropdown.
You can check it in the a demo provided by your side:
You can see that when you open the dropdown to make a selection, then use the mouse to select an entry, the dropdown closes, but the focus is not back to the dx-texteditor-input, but it is probably on the element (popup) which is hidden. This means that nothing is focused. When pressing the tab key it will focus the first element on the page.
 

Dear DevExpress Team
I got to update the value OrderID of an Entity "Order_Details" which is the PrimaryKey. The whole is in ServerMode. The OrderID is connected to the "ShipName".  In the sample if you press there the button "Edit" it opens a DXWindow for editing. In this Moment in the file EntityServerModerCRUDBehaviorDB.cs Method  "EditRow()" the EntityKey will be get from the Grid.CurrentItem. If you close the DXWindow I use this EntityKey again in the Method "OnEditRowDialogClosed  " to ApplyCurrentValues and save after the changes with SaveChanges(). I also change the ObjectState to EntityState.Modified. - Didn't help.
The Problem is I got an Exception which says the OrderID is a part of the key and you can't change it. I tried to DeleteObject and AddObject after. I also couldn't delete it. If you try to delete it straight from the Table by pressing delete it works. - but in OnEditRowDialogClosed doesn't.
What I'm doing wrong? Please help me. I have no clue where is the point.
Thanks a lot for your help

This code was working in previous versions, but for some reason not now.  
When executed on a cell that has no data, it returns the following exception:
'Expression illegal in evaluator'
If I put a single spaced character in the referenced cell, it works as expected. 
I've attached an image for context (sorry for the low resolution on it).
 

Hello,
I would like to know if the DXTreeList control supports the INotifyDataErrorInfo interface for validating nodes.
I am building an editor for a hierarchical  structure of classes. Some of these classes are leafs (no children) and contain a single value. Some others are containers and do not have a value. The treelist shows two columns: the first contains the label of the object, the second the editable value.
The tree is build by using ChildNodesSelector as TreeDerivationMode for the TreeListView and providing a CellTemplateSelector for the Value column.
Validating the value of the leafs with IDataErrorInfo  is ok and can be done when setting the value, but I need to validate the containers also based on the content of the childs. I do not see a simple way to do this with IDataErrorInfo.
Thanks

Hello,
I'm using the report designer in a solution and I get a crash related to the Property-> Lines when editing a field/table cell.
 I have managed to recreate this in the demo centre using the Reporting Invoice example. 
The program shows the error (causes a crash in my program) if you double click a table cell and enter a value such as "-". Then click back on the cell go to Property->Lines double click the "..." button that appears clear the "-" from the text box and press ok.
I have attached a video showing this error in the Reporting Invoice Demo Centre example.

Hi,
The following behavior looks like a bug.
We have an application using the DocumentView/TabbedView where each Document is a UserControl that has a Ribbon.  
- When a document is activated (TabbedView.DocumentActivated), the ribbon of the UserControl is merged into the Ribbon of the Main form 
- When a document is deactivated (TabbedView.DocumentDeactivated), the ribbon of the Main form is unmerged.  
Here is what we do to produce a problem:
- Open a UserControl (UC1) with a Ribbon whose items have no shortcuts
- Open another UserControl (UC2) with a Ribbon that has an item with a shortcut (CTRL+F5 for example)
- Switch back to the tab of the first UserControl
--> Now.. the ribbon of UC1 is visibly merged into the main Ribbon.
--> However, when I press the Shortcut Key (CTRL+F5 in our example), the Ribbon item on UC2 reacts (even though it is currently not merged)
Maybe it's reacting because the ribbon of UC2 is still technically there (inside UC2) but not visible.  In that case, we would need a way to temporarily disable shortcuts on a given ribbon object.
What should we do here?
Best,

SaveLayoutToXml just seems to have the DataSource as #Ref-0.
This seems rather strange.
So in the ReportDesigner I override the default queries that I provide to the report which the actual ones I want to run using the SQL Datasource wizard.
Make changes to my document, get it all working and then save it to disk so I can then load it in the DocumentViewerControl elsewhere in the program.
Opening it in the document viewer from the repx file (LoadLayoutFromXml), there's no datasource though!  Queries are gone.
So, this can't be right, what am I doing wrong? 

We use these 2 features heavily and today the client is required to load too much data to render the reports.

Hi DevExpress !
Please see the attached project. It simulates the creation of a form based on a LayoutControl, in my real application.
The layout is rather complex, but in my tests it takes about 1,7 s to 1,8 s to build. 
Is there something I can do to speed up the whole thing ? 
Thank you.

Hey guys, I have placed a DateEdit on a Razor View and the date edit works as expected, except for the drop down icon. It does not show up at all. If you click where it is supposed to be, the drop down works, but as I said, no icon. 
I followed the instructions to setup bootstrap core. I am not sure why this is happening.

Context a main "custom usercontrol" as BaseDocument docking in a MDI winform, able to give the list of informations (document parameters) it can answers. A and inner specific usercontrol on this main control to manage reports exploring/ previewing / user design.
With some Devexpress sample i manage the "Drag And Drop" ability between Treeview (Document parameters), so i can : 
- detect the dropping treenode and get back the (document parameter) name
- adding this as XtraReportParameter in XtraReport.Parameters
- creating a XRLabel, upon the xrdesignpanel, where the draganddrop location
... but i'm still not able to create a binding between thix XRLabel, and the New xtrareport parameter.
It seems we need to create a new  DevExpress.XtraReports.Native.Parameters.ParametersDataSource
but i can't find a sample to do it right. !  

Hi There,
I'm making a site where a user can login and work indirectly with an Azure Storage Account using the FileManager and FileUpload controls. 
However, once AccountManager.RegisterAzure is set, how can I wipe it a reset it if the user logs off and  on again (with a different username) so they can see a different Azure SA? There doesn't appear to be a .dispose or .clear method for AccountManager. I get 'Account name already exists.'
How can it be recycled?

Hi,
I'm migrating an application to XAF.
I would like to create a sales-quote  editor, having on the left the list of catalogitems and on the right the list of items selected for this sales quote.
The way I found doing this is to create a detail view for the quote, with a master-detail view listing the quote's items (on the right)
The list of catalog items available is not related to the items of the quote, so to add it to the quote detail view, I added to the left a DashboardViewItem  and linked that dashboard view item to a list view of my catalog table.
I now need to do the following:
Add a filter to limit the catalog items to a specific category. I'd like to have a drop-down com bo with the catalog items categories and then filter the catalog list view based on the selected category.
I looked around the filters available in XAF (either the row filter embedded in the grid, but it does not comes with a list of categories, I need to type it which is not user friendly), other option is to create grid filters but it is also  not as easy sas just having a combo on top of the list.
So, is there a way to add a combo containing the contents of a category table, then have a filter of the list view based on the selected item of the combo ?
Thanks 

Hello everybody,
I just noticed that filters in on detail report affect charts in a second, separate detail report. In essence, I did the following:
1. Create a new report (the data source consist of a list and the list elements contain another list)
2. Add a detail report
3. Add a nested detail report for for the inner list
4. Define a filter for the nested detail report
5. On the top level, add a second detail report
6. Add a chart to the second detail report which has the inner list as data
Expected result: the chart contains all data as it is located in a completely separate DetailReport
Actual result: the data for the chart is filtered according to the filter defined in the nested DetailReport
I have attached my sample code and a short video which shows how to reproduce the issue. Is this expected behavior? Thank you for your help.
Best regards,
Christopher


Thanks. Silly question but how do you add new buttons in code behind? 
All I'm seeing is this
Is there another way to create them or do I have to create something called a BaseButtonCollection?

Is the ParametersRequestBeforeShow event not supported in the WPF designer?  I'm trying to use it to pre-populate known parameters but it doesn't fire. 

I noticed, then in every user folder AppData\Local\Apps\2.0\B7OE9YPN.CRZ\ZLD1YWZO.AME\ i have a lot of devexpress libraries. 
This server works as Internet Server and database server.  Can I delete it?

Hello,
I am working with EntityFeedbackSource for the first time and have a couple of questions.
1. How can I display a Progress Panel when the grid starts reloading data and hide it when the grid finishes reloading data?  My remote database is not extremely quick, so the rows can be seen populating.
 2. With a regular System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource, there is a CurrentChanged event, which fires when the user selects a row in the grid (when the grid is bound to a regular BindingSource).  What is the corresponding technique for EntityFeedbackSource to tell when the user has selected a new row in the grid?  
Thanks! 

See example app:
 Steps:
1. Run the example app
2. Click the button labeled "Toggle Popup Visibility"
3. Close the resulting popup using the "X" button in corner 
4. Click "Yes" on the dialog
5. 
 that the popup closes with no console errors.
6. Repeat step 2
7. Close the resulting popup using the "Toggle Popup Visibility" button inside the popup
8. 
 that a 
appears in the console
9. Click "Yes" ont he resulting dialog
10. 
 that there was a second dialog  hidden behind the first - onHiding was called twice
Please advise how to fix this error and the duplicate dialog.

I struggle to find a clean 
way to change the display text of a LookUpEdit two show a concatenation of two columns/properties. This is complicated by the fact that the data in the model is stored in a database via Entity Framework and the view is a single object view generated by the 
.
The entities of type Connector have another property "PartNo" and 
.
We abandoned using a 
or handling the 
 via 
, because both only get the ID and would need to query the DbContext to get the values of both properties. This seems wrong, since all required information are already there in the columns that are shown in the popup panel of the LookUpEdit.
Our current solution is to define a 
 in 
 and specifying it by adding 
 to all LookUpEdits we want it:
This does what we want, but we had to play around a bit to find the exact properties of the controls so it looks the same as other LookUpEdits without this ControlTemplate.
Is there a better way to do this while maintaining the MVVM pattern?

I am trying to set the client side visibility of a TextBox and DateEdit control in js based on the value selected in a ComboBox.  I have pasted the code for the controls and my js below.  The alert statements indicate the correct visibility but the controls don't appear.  Please advise.

Hi Nikolia, 
I like the way items are organized inside a user control. 
A user control is a class, so i create a properties send data back and forth. (getters and setters)
I did have an issue with ASPxGridView  inside a user control.  Apparently, I need to turn off the View State. 
Other issues with grouping controls into user controls.  
VS is slow. I had to add a property into the DIV css class  display:none; to hide control in the designer and change the css class when form loads.
Like this  header3.Attributes["class"] = "header3show";

I am just trying to populate the TcxDBEXTLookupCombobox with a datasource. I use this datasource for other db grids so I know it works. When I go to select ListFieldItem from the properties it is empty.
I have got to be missing something really simple - I am a VB.Net developer working with Delphi now. 

1) Run the attached project
2) Press the button and note that it correctly sets the treelist's filter
3) Upgrade the project to 17.2.5 (I'm not sure if hotfix 18036 is required)
4) Press the button again 
You should get the following exception
Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.

I have a simple class that I'm using to hold TreeList data:
The KeyFieldName is NodeId.
If I load data into the tree with the first item having a NodeId of zero, when I try to drag data from another tree to the first item, it improperly makes that data the root node. I'm attaching an image to show the problem.
In that image, notice that the "Pid" of the new item added is "0" and should have shown up as a child of the item with a description of "1".
The issue only appears when adding items after the tree is initially populated, and only if the initial NodeId is 0. I tried non-zero values such as "1" and "100" and both worked correctly.
Thanks.

Hi,
I can't find a solution to my angular 2+ problem.
I have a treeview bound to flat data. Now I want to show a tooltip when hovering a node with specific data from that node (e.g. tooltip value of the flat data row) .
Any idea how I can solve this using DevExtreme?
Greetings,
Sigurd 

When a form loads I set a NavBarItem caption like this
 The actual caption when the Form opens is "Limited"
What could be causing this? 

Hi.
I have set AlwaysVisible to True for the Find panel in a RepositoryGridLookupEdit in a GridControl, but it does not show.
How can I show it and set focus to the Find box when the user opens the popup?
Thanks.

I swear I've done this before but maybe not. Where is the "find panel"? I tried various settings to get it to show up but can't seem to do so.

Hi,
I have created one DevExpress report.
In a preview mode it works fine. it shows the parameter and gives me the option to select multiple values including select ALL on top.
but when i run the report in browser, i dont see select all option.
how can i enable select all option there in parameter.
i have placed some screen pictures here
 

Gridview has these settings:
<Settings ShowFilterBar="Hidden" 
                ShowFilterRow="False" 
                ShowFilterRowMenu="True" 
                ShowFooter="True"  
                ShowHeaderFilterButton="True" 
                ShowTitlePanel="True" 
                ShowPreview="True" 
                ShowGroupPanel="True" 
                AutoFilterCondition="Contains" 
                ShowFilterRowMenuLikeItem="True" />
 
<SettingsBehavior 
                EnableCustomizationWindow="True" 
                AllowSort="true" AllowGroup="True" 
                AllowSelectSingleRowOnly="True" 
                ColumnResizeMode="NextColumn" />
There are 3 checkboxes on each row of the gridview. When a filter is applied whether by textbox or column value, the checkbox values are lost. The code that sets them is being executed just prior to the gridview_DataBound being executed. How do I persist these checkbox values?
When the page is changed of the columns sorted the values are still there.

Hi.  I'm looking for a demo that will create a donut chart in MVC and give me the ability to export it on the server (like this example: 
).  Is this possible in MVC, and do you have this example?
Thank you so much 

I have a grid bounded to a data table.    
 I have a "copy" context menu in the row.  The idea is that when the user selects "copy", the  selected row is duplicated in the grid.
What is the best way to do this? 
thanks! 

The XPO Data Model Designer stores the generated code under <MODEL_NAME>Code folder which clashes with our namespace policy. Where can I change the output Folder?
e.g. MyModel.xpo => to projectroot/ExampleSolution/MyModel instead of projectroot/ExampleSolution/MyModelCode

Is there any way to use a skin mask color on elements not defined by images? For example, I have an OfficeNavigationBar, and I'm using a mask color. I want to define the "Pressed" color to use the skin mask color.

We would like to have our datagrid's columns resize independently to each other. Setting columnResizingMode to "widget" gets us closer to that goal. However we also use and display the column chooser, search panel, and the pager. It seems that resizing a column resizes the entire control causing the other datagrid elements to move horizontally as well, which is bad UX. This sometimes causes the search panel and the pager to be clipped on the right side if the columns don't all fit on screen.
Is there a way to have the other panels in a datagrid stay fixed with only the columns resizing in columnResizeMode='widget'?
Leaving the column resizing to the old method causes our users to constantly have to resize all the other columns to the right because their size shrinks.

Does the Map control in WPF (or Winforms) support vector labeling rather than having them right on the map tiles?  I want to be able to add my own layer and have the street names appear above it so my layer elements don't obscure the map labels.

I have a FormatConditionRule3ColorScale rule applied to a BandedGrid.  On the UI, the color scale rule works properly.
However, when exporting to Excel (Data Aware), the colors appear to be inverted.
In my attached image, in the BandedGrid (top), the color scale is ordered from Red to Green Descending.  In the Data Aware Excel file (bottom), the color starts with green and ends with red.
 

In a RibbonForm without an application menu, dragging the application button out of the ribbon causes stop of the Ribbon visual updates.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new RibbonForm project.
2. Add couple of hoverable items to the  ribbon (for instance: buttons).
3. Run the app.
4.  Try do drag the application menu button out of the Ribbon (place the cursor over application button, press LMB, move the cursor below the ribbon, release LMB).
5. Move the mouse over the Ribbon items.
Expected result:
Items indicate they're hovered 
Actual result:
Items don't indicate they're hovered 

Hi, Im using Angular to make a DataGrid. My datagird has a selection mode of "multiple" and im using a row template for the table body. Problem is the checkboxes don't show in the selection column. How might this be accomplished?

Hello,
Is there any tool available for nested rows? Consider the following data:

Hello,
 
My name is Jacob and my account: jacob@bigjewelers.com.
The business requires to have dtTagbox with the large number or items.
I can assign datasource or items to json data on the client and if it needs to be on the server side i can do it as well.
So, if I just do that it takes to long just to open the list.
I tried setup infinite scrolling and it does not work. I am a new to your tools. And there is no exact example how to do it. 
As i mentioned, i have data as json on the client  side.
Please help me to get this done.
I can give you my code example:
Thank you an advance,

Tooltip comes ok when loading the chart first time, but every time form reloads (I have months, Quarters, Year selection above the webchart in order to filter data accordingly) the count of period string gets added by 2 (first load:1 occurrence, second load: 3 occurrences and so on).
Please let me know how to overcome this issue. 

My web form has one button and one gridview. By clicking the button, user can choose a fildname from a drop down list from the database. Then a new row is created.  I dynamically create different controls base on the field name column by implementing the i template class as shown in the screen shot. My question are: 
1‍. Every time I click the button or create new rows, the data in the input control is gone. How can I keep those data.
 ‍Thanks


Hi,
I have a aspImageSlider with a template, created at runtime. Each slide renders 2 times the template, but it only enters once inside the template definition code. I'm I doing anything wrong?
The control definition:
            
The Template class:
AS you can see in the screenshot, the template is rendered twice in each slide.
Thank you

Hello, whenever I expand my tree nodes theres a chance the comboboxedit column gets changed. Is there any reason this might be happening? 
This is the template I have for it, the adjustment modes is a list of strings and the selectedItem is a string. It keeps trying to set the selectedItem to null when I expand the list which I put a null check for, but it still overwrites it without hitting the setter. 
Also tried hard coding the value  to "TEST"  in the NodeExpanded event but some of the values are still being overwritten, most of the comboboxEdits do have "TEST" though.

Please look at the client column in the uploaded picture, the grid view not wrapping the word with "_"

Hi, I'm trying to make a complex query within the query builder for the dashboard module since I can not find another way to enter a query.
Actually I have a static function in one of my classes that returns a CriteriaOperator based on the parameters passed, to be able to use this would be great, but I'll settle with reproducing the query in the dashboards module.
The part I'm having trouble reproducing is:




To be more specific the join with the class ChangeInStatus because I need to find if within that class I have a record for the parent within the dates I'm looking, but it seems I can not make this kind of query with the query  builder.
Please advise.

Tested in on a company machine and on my private machine,
i seem to can't get the Demo working you have provided for DevExtreme with .NetCore support.
The Page starts, but the Frame where the Grid should appear stays empty.
I've checked the source and Javascript Console and couldn't find any obvious reasons.
Any pointers where the problem might lay?
Other Demos ,not using .NetCore seem to work properly.
 

Hello
We are get ting an extra icon on some ASPxPopupControls with v17.2.4.
In the attached PDF there is the generated popup, the code definition and the generated HTML for the ASPxPopupControl (popLinkedTags) in v17.1.7 (our current production version) and v17.2.4.  The only difference I can see is in the generated HTML.
In v17.1.7 we get:
Whereas in v17.2.4 we get:
I have also included another ASPxPopupControl (v17.2.4) from the same page and that is displaying correctly.
The extra icon does not perform any function.
Can you please advise a resolution.

Hi,
We recently upgraded Dev Express version 12.2.18.0 to  17.1.6. With older version, it used to copy the font style, format of the source to the RichEditControl. But after upgrade it doesn't.  After setting the CopyPaste and set it to 'KeepSourceFormatting',  we can see the font style and size are copied over. LayoutUnit is Document in both the old and new version. We notice that the size of the font is slightly thicker/bigger because of which the text doesn't fit in a line and last line appears in next page (attached is the sample text of different version, the bottom is ver 17.1.6. because of the change in the formatting of the rtf document, user has to go to every template document before faxing/printing. 
Note:The size of the RichEditBar Controller tool/menu of v17.1.6 is slightly bigger than v12.2.18.
Thanks & Regards,
Sarju

I used E108, but it has no report or page headers like most reports do. How do I get the column headings to appear differently for the first page?
For example, my report should look like this when rendered:
Report Header
  First page info goes here
Detail Report
  Column headings go here
  First page of grid goes here
Page Break
Page Header
  Column headings go here
  Rest of grid goes here

We are a program with hundreds of actions across a ribbon. There are many tabs. We are finding that the OnUpdate of these actions are being called way too many times.
We have tracked it down to the fact that there seems to be a timer inside the devEx code that is firing a few times per second. This is backed up by the following post
This timer is causing the OnIdle to fire over and over again. The problem is the code below only checks if the Bar is visible. It does not check if the Bar is on a visible tab. So, only one tab is visible, the vast majority of the items are hidden from the user, yet their OnUpdate is being fired. Is there a way to check if a particular BarItem is actually showing to the user, and not fire the OnUpdate in that case?
The code for TdxBarManagerUpdateActionsListener.InitiateAction is below



I am using a class derived from the richedit control. When I set the readonly property in my form load, it is ignored, and inspection shows the readonly property is set to false, despite being explicitly set true.

Hi there,
Having issue with integrating third party HTML editor into dxDataGrid (using CKEditor 5). I managed to show third party HTML editor in the dxDatagrid, but having issue is with saving and displaying data in the editor.
My dxDataGrid code:
My Editor JavaScript code for editor which i am using to call on Initialized event.  
However, always HTML editor data is empty and do not display any value inside editor. I tried assign values in different ways:
1) $("#isdDescription").val("<p>xxxx</p>") - did not work.
2) $("#isdDescription").cellValue(rowIndex, "isdDescription", "<p>xxxxxxx</p>") - did not work.
3) Tried to add onValueChanged event  like - onValueChanged("function(args) {   setValue(args.value); }") - did not work.
So not sure how to make it work together.  (I attached picture that i managed to achieve only)
Could you please advise me how to fix this issue or find alternative solution if i want to allow for user to enter HTML elements in the description?
 

I have a base form which contains a gridcontrol. I inherit from this form, and just customize the columns. I have about 8 forms I did around 14 months ago, and they work fine. In (at least) v16, I thought I used to be able to invoke the grid editor. T
This is now not an option. How can I get the GUI gridview editor on an inherited form containing gridview?

Hello!
How do we use the popup edit mode to Add a new entry and not close the window, but rather clear it and keep it open for a new entry? Think of it as speed adding. On edit, the standard behavior of closing should apply.
Thanks! 

Hello!
How do we specific that a string should render as a textarea with word wrap, rather than a textbox in the popup edit mode for a DataGrid?
Thanks! 

I am having a bit of difficulty understanding the meaning/implementation of the TreeList Selection and the relationship with the FocusedNode.
It seems the FocusedNode does not even need to be part of the Selection, because I am forced to have a FocusedNode but the Selection can be empty. Why is the FocusedNode not part of the Selection and under what circumstances should I know if it will be included or not?
Setting a collection of nodes to be selected seems to be a problem as well. If I set FocusedNode = someNode it clears the selection except for that one node, but if I am trying to programmatically set the Selection collection, I may not want to include the old focused node. I have the appearance of the Selected Nodes the same as FocusedNode so this is visually confusing. I cannot change it appearance though because I am required to show what the user has selected the same way.
Any thoughts on how to overcome these problems?
Thank you.

Hi:
    In 20,000 lines of the program, when the program goes wrong, Tdxspreadsheet.Enabled = false, the mouse click is of no use. 
    It is very difficult to find mistakes in these 20,000 programs,If TdxSpreadsheet can be used to display data, so it is easy to find the reason.
    Dozens of modules of such 20,000 lines of programs, please help solve this problem.I need TdxSpreadsheet to be active for use under any circumstances.
thank you very much!

Run the attached project, which contains a 2 node treelist and a BestFitMaxNodeCount set much larger than the number of nodes
Press the "BestFit" button, note that it properly  handles this case.
Filter the column so that 1 of the 2 nodes is filtered, with the 2nd one visible
Press the "BestFit" button  again, note that it does not BestFit properly

how to use or what code to use, to use the concept of GenericForenKey, with the code devexpress, you can give me a simple and practical example to learn how to use this concept based on your documentation and / or help
Currently, I am using some genericforenKey, because in the new classes I add the following code.
but I have had difficulties to implement it efficiently and correctly.
Context:
I have class A; This is my main class and I have a relationship with class B, which is also main.
but from the class A mapping to an A1 class, and from the Class B Class B1 mapping.
of the current form that I am reacting requires me to create another relational field in case B1, which contains A1. therefore, I do not use the same relationship that I previously used in A and B.
and I create that new "Association" to show it in A1, with the New fields that I created in Class B1.
How do I use the same relationship and do not create another?
Initial relationship A - B
Relationship A1-B1 (MapInheritance)
I know that I am not using the Code correctly, I need to know how I should implement my code in a better way, and that in class A1, I generate the fields and others of Class B1; But I'm still using my Initial Relationship (AB) to APPLY for the "genericForenKey",
What I have As a consequence in my TABLE of my Database, is of 2 Related Fields "A" and "A1"; when it should be 1 single related field.
That is, only the related field "A"

Hi DevExpress Support,

Hello,
 
We are using treelist to display data, there are checkbox and one column (IsChecked) If checkbox is checked then field value of IsChecked should be true otherwise false, for that I have used below code, it is working fine if I have small amount of data, but while I have large amount of data (>50000) it works very much slow.
class CustomNodeOperation : TreeListOperation
{
       public CustomNodeOperation()
       : base()
       {           
       }
       public override void Execute(TreeListNode node )
       {
               node.SetValue("IsChecked", Convert.ToBoolean(node.CheckState));            
       }
}
Please let me know if need more information.

Hi,
I want to use the TimeSpanEditor in my application, however I don?t know how to configure a mask that allow the user to pick only days.
TimeSpanEdit by default offers Dd:Hh:Mm:Ss  as the standard mask... I want to change the mask so it shows only whole days...
How can I do that?
By the way, Vb.Net here..

Is it possible to add a PropertyEditor to a DashboardView?
I've tried this, but the issue appears to be that a DashboardView doesn't target a specific business object, and so in the Model the properties of the property editor cannot be correctly populated.
My goal is to create a dropdown in the Dashboard where I can use a LookupListView to select an object of Type "Store", similar to how I would in a DetailView.  If I can't use a property editor for that, is there a similar controller I can add via a ControlDetailItem on the Dashboard? 

Hi,
I have large dataset loaded on the grid when I try to copy entire content the application hangs till all data is copied to clipboard and the user remains clueless as the app grid becomes unresponsive.
What I would like to have is while all rows are getting's copied to clipboard  I would like to show a Wait indicator so the user is aware that the rows are getting copied.
Can you help me with some events to hookup the wait indicator
Also the copy functionality is very slow  can anything be done to improve its performance?
I am loading around 1000 rows and 50 columns  and it takes of 5 to 6 seconds.
Thanks,

Hello!
I need to use Hangfire to run scheduled jobs in my XAF Web application. For the purpose of manipulating business objects in job methods, i need to get access to the ObjectSpace.
I am going to declare static XPObjectSpaceProvider in Global.asax.cs, initialize it with ConnectionString from configuration file and then use it in static methods.
I use the following code to initialize ObjectSpaceProvider instance:
Is it enough to make it work? Do i need to somehow collect XPO classes using ReflectionDictionary or something like that? What is the best solution for my case?
Thank you! 

Thanks.

Hello,
let's say I have BootstrapGridView showing some data. Data in grid depends on a value of some other component, eg. BootstrapDatePicker.

Could you plese advise me a way how to achieve this?

Hello,
I am working with EntityFeedbackSource for the first time and have a couple of questions.
 2. With a regular System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource, there is a CurrentChanged event, which fires when the user selects a row in the grid (when the grid is bound to a regular BindingSource).  What is the corresponding technique for EntityFeedbackSource to tell when the user has selected a new row in the grid?  
Thanks!

See the attached video. To replicate, right click a calendar and add a new general appointment, then start typing into the subject field. The apt form disappears. It sometimes comes back if you keep typing or click on various places in the app. Sometimes it never comes back into view.
This was submitted by a user on a live system. I believe it was running on  a Windows 10 machine dialled into a RDP session also running Win 10. They say the issue has been there since the 17.1 update.
Cheers - Gerard
 

I have a DocumentManager and DockManager in XtraForm1. I added two Tabbed Panels using the DockManager designer. However there are Duplicate windows added when I run the application. I;m assuming I'm not doing something correctly.

The problem reported in ticket 
 has not been fixed completely.
Let me first inform you that the paint problem before 17.2.4 was much worse when sorting on a Sum group summary of a float field (not sure if type of field makes a difference or not). In my test sometimes only the first group row was not drawn as stated in the ticket but more often there were many records from multiple groups on top and some of them were duplicated in groups bellow. The other problem was that when you use sort by group summary, on closing the application, it would throw many access violation errors in the FinalizeUnits procedure. 
The painting has been fixed in 17.2.4. the access violations in FinalizeUnits procedure remain.
I think this should be easy to replicate. Load a table with at least 200 records and group on a column that will produce at least 10 groups. Add a Sum summary on a float field  and then sort on group summary. Now close the application.

Hi,
I have attached a sample project in angular js.  in this project,  I have used dxautocomplete.  But it is not working.  Check my solution for more details.
 

Hi Team,
I have a use case where I need to hide  column headers (gridView1.OptionsView.ShowColumnHeaders = false), which will restrict users to resize columns. I would like to check with you is there any option to overcome this behavior?
I have attached a demo project that show this behavior, please help.
Thanks,
Hari Prasad  

When the AutoFilterCriteria is used in a grid using PLinqInstantFeedbackDataSource, the criteria is temporarily set to null while being changed by the user. This causes the column filter to use "Starts with" even if it's a numeric column. This can easily be reproduced using the "Data Grid - Multithread Data Processing" demo. Just add ShowCriteriaInAutoFilterRow="True" to the TableView
I have recorded 
.
/Andreas 

cellTemplate: function(container, options){
    console.log(options.data.Status);
    console.log(typeof(options.data.Status));
    $("<div />").dxSwitch({
    value: options.data.Statuss
    }).appendTo(container);
}
In the above code snippet, "value" is not recognizing(binding) the data supplied to it, in spite of the value being of boolean type.

Hi there,
I am using custom repository item in gridview by referring 
. 
But somehow i stuck by following issues :
1.How to Auto-Height the row as per custom repository item's content and
2.How to trigger event from custom repository item to its parent grid.
Do you have more simplified way to add custom repository item in v17.2?
Thanks


Hi Marina, 
The "solution" you are referencing is 8 years old and the code being used does not match the examples provided in the demos. I am working on resolving the same issue and despite upwards of 10 articles on it, everyone keeps pointing to that same 8 year old response. 
In the current Demo, the grid export buttons are not inside a ASPxPopupMenu with a unique ID that can be referenced as a control for the PostBackTrigger. The commands are listed like so:



I've tried a number of things such as clicking an asp:Button programatically within the ClientSideEvent "ToolbarItemClick" to calling a GridViewExport control from the code behind on the OnToolbarItemClick event. I've also tried the custom command thing using e.usePostBack=true; and still no dice. Nothing seems to work but as soon as I comment out the UpdatePanel everything works fine and I get my exported file. 
I would appreciate a more current or complete answer on how to export the grid when it is inside an UpdatePanel. I only make a big deal out of this because there are free tools utilizing javascript where export seems to work flawlessly - UpdatePanel or not. 

I have gauge with two needles and one scale. Is it possible to animate both needle? When I change value by needle.Value animation doesn't work. It work only when I change value by scale.Value.

I'm trying to make a column visible at design time. I've set visible index but the column is not displayed in the correct Position.

How can i move the column after the last one?
Thanks in Advice.

I was wondering if there is a way of hooking up on a onClick event of the dxCalendar. At first I thought I could subscribe to onValueChanged but I quickly realized that this event doesn't suit me as I might be clicking on an already selected date so this event would not fire.
My idea is to present the calendar control for each month for the current year and than the user can click on various dates and will get a popup where he can enter the holiday name and description.
Right now I can deal with that by subscribing to onValueChanged but this only works if I want to select a date that has not yet been selected.If I click on an already selected date, nothing happenes(obviously since no change has been made to the value) .

    I'm missing right now the posibility to check the checkbox as filter for the checked rows (like we had before). As you can see, all checked rows as grouped.   
  
  

when I use ASPxVerticalGrid  bind my DataTable datasource, it shows the error  'Uncaught TypeError: ASPx.VerticalGridFixedRowsHelper is not a constructor'  in browser,

Okay, it seems that the settings in the sample solve the height issue, I am going to test them in my dev environment. 
However, what I don't see in the sample is the cardview obeying boostrap container widths. Since the cardview is rendered inside a col-8 div, it should take 8/12ths of the screen. 
I am attaching two images, one from running the sample and the other from my current implementation of the card view to indicate the width issue.

Hello,
I have a nonpersistent  type MyNonPersistentObject. In the WinApplication constructor I add it to the AdditionalSecuredTypes:
DevExpress.ExpressApp.Security.SecurityStrategyComplex.AdditionalSecuredTypes.Add(GetType(Solution18.Module.MyNonPersistentObject))
When checking SecuritySystem.IsGranted(...) I get different results, depending on which function is called:
returns 
: SecuritySystem.IsGranted(... .Read)) 
returns 
: SecuritySystem.IsGranted(... .Read, bo)) 
This was different in 17.1: both returned 
.
To reproduce this in the attached project, log in as "
" and click on the "
2" action. The MyNonPersistentObject_DetailView should show the "protected content" editor, too.

Hi,
here a sample project that i built to test the Token editor provided here:  
if you launch the application, and add a new DomainObject1, you will have a detailview with a token Editor called 'DomainObject2s' and a 'My display name' text box. The latest takes the last selected item from the token box: see... it doesn't work
BUT, if you go the Model.DesignedDiffs.xafml of the web project, and change the order of the 2 properties ('My display name' comes above the 'DomainObject2s')  then it works perfectly.
Any idea?

Hello,
In a line chart. when my dataset has identical date time argument values, the X axis labels are no longer visible. I have attached a sample project replicating this behavior.
Thank you for any help regarding this issue.
 

Hi,
If you create a chart with 2 series. You assign one serie to the left axis and the other on the right axis. Using logarithmic scale and a tickinterval of 1.
It will trigger an infinite loop and crash the browser.
It happens because at one point dx code is trying to find the log of 0 wich set a value to NaN and prevent the "do while" loop of _createTicks to finish.
Using latest Build, the browser is not crashing but an error is output : 
W2003: "Tick interval is too small"
Which is weird becaus if you take series individually with the same tickinterval, no problem
Here is a sample using your demo example and the data I use.

Hi,
I'm working with XtraReports to generate a PDF report. Using XRLabels to display text or to bind object values. 
when the text in XRLabel is larger than the width we set  to the label, the text is splitting to next line as i set word-wrap property. But the next line is not moving down, due to which the text is overlapping on the below text.
I need to auto align the lines if the text comes to next line, but should not overlap. Could you please suggest me how can we solve this issue.
Thank You,

Hello Support,
As the subject explains, when I apply a filter to my grid (within a tab control then a navigation frame)  the grid loses the sort and filtering when navigated back. 
It makes no difference to this issue enabling cache mode on the navigation  and tab control.
Is this expected?
I tried looking at saving the grid layout to a stream but the UserControl unloaded event isn't triggered on the viewmodel (POCO) when navigating away. It is triggered on  the code behind but the datacontext is then null so I have no where to save the stream. I don't want to save it to XML as the user could have many instances of the tab open with different layouts / filters.
Any help is appreciated.  
Thank you. 

Good morning,
I am developing my application using XAF. In my web application I need to create a custom view with a chart that gets data from a SP and displays the values of each property/column selected. My problem is that I don't understand what property/object I need to add to my WebChartControl to display the data elements in the chart.
I already created the basis of my view and did the databind but I can't seem to find the appropriate documentation of what properties to edit (I can only find documentation regarding the control use at runtime and not design). 
Bellow is the code I have so far:

One question more,
how can I obtain the exact height of a TileView?
 I use the Skin Office 2016 Colorful, and a TileView within a LayoutControlItem within a LayoutControl, and I set the LayoutControlItem MinimumSize height to this.tileView.OptionsTiles.ItemSize.Height x number of items shown, but it seems that it is not exactly that height.

If a field bounded to an enums data type is moved from filter to data area by code (even when load a layout from memory stream) an exception was throw.
If you drag the field manually from filter to data area all works fine.
The problem is that users move the field to data arrea, save layout and than, when reload the layout, the exception was throw.
The problem is not present in the 16.2.5 version.

Hi,
I have gridview in main screen which show popup form on edit and double click. In popup form, I also have two tabs (using page control). First tab  show edit screen of grid, while second tab allows user to add relevant child entity. 
e.g. One Institute can be associated with many schools. 
so on Institute grid, you can open popup edit form where on first tab it will show edit details of Institute and in second tab user can add associate schools.
While above is perfectly working fine in edit, while adding new record is a problem  currently. before we are adding associated school in second tab, we need to make sure that user save institute data first and thus generate Institute Id first. To achieve this, I need to know
1) How to save data in database on save button click but do not close screen . I found below ticket most relevant for this:
But by looking at comments in it, it seems it has lots of issues. Please suggest best approach for this.
2) As per 1, we are not closing screen on save, so Grid should be refreshed on close button click. Is it implicit or do we need to do anything for this?
3) Alternative approach is, we hide second tab while adding new record (less prefferable) but would like to know if we go by this approach, how can I hide second tab while adding new record.
I have attached my working project files here for your reference.
Thanks,

Hi Team!
I am migrating a solution with multiple projects dependent on DevExpress libraries to use DevExpress nuget repository.
It is quite confusing for me that the package names do not really match the dll libraries names (e.g. DevExpress.Xpf.*.dll are in  DevExpress.Wpf.* packages) and some packages contain multiple dlls, which makes it hard to find out which package you need to install in order to get a particular dll.
Given that I thought it would be very useful to have a list of available nuget packages mapped to the libraries they contain so that one could reference it and automate the migration process.
Could you please provide me with this information?
Thanks!
P.S. I have seen this article 
 and it is not actually supplying such detailed info as I'm looking for.

Hi team,
I am trying to retrieve selected items using the implementation listed in the link below:
The following implementation has got code behind which is adding or removing Selected items of grid. Ideally, if it should be done automatically if we have bound property to SelectedItems   (just like ListBoxEdit.CheckedStyleSettings => EditValues), however, it does not hit that bound property at all. Is there any way, we can get those selected values without adding code behind in data grid view. Thanks.

In other words, the users will be able to read the protected field only from the rows that contains their names.
Any help to implement this will be appreciated.

Eric

I am using the scheduler with day view grouped by resources. Is it possible to display a custom tooltip (or a menu) when clicking on an empty cell? That is when the user clicks on an appointment I want to display a tooltip of type 1 (the default behavior is ok) and when clicking on an empty cell I want to display a tooltip of type 2 (or a menu).
 

Hi DevExpress, 
I am using  DevExpress ver 12.2 with my SharePoint 2010 environment, we are using some DevExpress controls like Grid, and combo in our ASPX Web form.
We are suing some other third party  chart solutions in our ASPX web forms, now we want to use DevExpress web charts.
Please find the attached pdf file. 
I hope to hear from you soon  and thanks in advance,

Hello,
I have a TcxBarEditItem on the TabAreaToolbar, and it doesn't work (and isn't rendered) correctly since I've changed from Delphi 10.2 to 10.2.2 Release 2.
I've tried versions 17.2.3 and 17.2.4, but the same result. 
See images attached.

In version 17.1, this fix likely also fixed a related issue.  The issue is that if you use a parameter in a computed field expression and add it as a dimension (visible, not hidden), it also causes GetUnderlyingData() to return null.
This issue is not a problem in 17.1, which we were very excited about.  However, we upgraded to 17.2 and now it's returning null again.  So, a bug was reintroduced and I bet it's closely related to this issue, which is why I'm adding this comment here.
Let me know if you guys are aware of this issue.
Update: 
Here is a test project recreating the bug.  I added a computed field called "Computed Field 1" that is an expression adding two parameters together.  When you double-click, it attempts to GetUnderlyingData() for "Computed Field 1" and gets null.  I added a "Computed Field 2" with a simple string expression just to make sure that my code was right.  "Computed Field 2" works, "Computed Field 1" does not.

Hello,
We started using the new Binding Expression  method in the reports.
When using a parameter in the expression in combination with another string value, something goes wrong:
Example binding expression on a Label:  
 With the following result:
System.Data.DataRowView12000.jpg
instead of:
c:\Pictures\12000.jpg
Are we doing something wrong? 
 
Thanks.

And Total Summary in bottom of page also needs to be updated.
How i do this?
Can you provide example to do it? 

I have just installed the Visual Studio 2017 Community version and then installed the Devexpress 17.2.4. Then I try to start a asp.net core project using the new --> project --> Devexpress core template. After that I try to run the sample application, it comes with the following error message:

Hello!
I want to restore some saved filter expressions.
It's impossible to restore FilterRowMenu condition. The first condition is always selected. But data are correctly filtered.
 Only for some conditions, the filter value is not restored in the filter column. If you click on the "Filter 1" button, the filter condition contains "Not Contains([ProductName], '2')". The filter value (2) is not restored, but data are correctly filtered.
See the attached zip which contains the sample project and a video.
Thanks for your help!

I'm using GridControl and one of the column’s EditSettings is set to LookUpEditSettings. 
What I'd like to achieve is that in “non edit” mode »lookup« cell is displayed as hyperlink and a drop down button.

Hi there,
The select box is not working on iOS. Even on your official demo's. Nothing happens when selecting a item on the drop down list.
Any workaround or fix available?

Hello,
Im using an ASPxPivotGrid and I would like to a 'custom' totals for parts of my rows.
For example , I have the following data rows ;
13
28 
10
7
18
34 
109 
368
I would like to get multiple totals (preferably at the bottom of the grid , which sums up the first 4 rows (and show that as total) and the last 4 rows (and show that as total).
The general idea is that I can get the sum of integers for between specific times (please see my screenshot)
Please advise.
Thnks.

My web form has one button and one gridview. By clicking the button, user can choose a fildname from a drop down list from the database.

Hi,
i'm using a BootstrapPopupControl in my application that i'd like to keep in the browser window's center even if the window is resized.
Using the

How can I get the new appearance offered in 17.2 for the grid TableView drag and drop (within the grid) and still use a GridDragDropManager?
So the way I understand the progression for TableView drag and drop support.
A) It was a requirement in the past that you derive your own DragDropManager and implement it as a behavior of the GridControl. 
B) In 17.2 you provide your own DragDropManager that can be used like so:
C) At some point, maybe 17.2 you made the explicit creation of a DragDropManager optional. The Demo Center (and latest online documentation for the GridControl) demonstrates  this technique by not explicitly defining a DragDropManager as a behavior. This renders a more modern hint appearance that is properly themed.
Scenarios A & B render a hint appearance like the attached A_B.png and scenario C renders a hint appearance like C.png. These screenshots are inside the zip.
Attached is a sample demonstrating the difference. How can I get the new appearance using the techniques of A&B since we have existing 
 event code for the DragDropManager?

Hi,
I have just set the ConfirmSendReport = true to test this feature.  The dialog gets displayed but then hangs with a "Sending" dialog when I click the "Send" button.  With  ConfirmSendReport = false everything has been working fine.


                                This example illustrates how to handle the 
, 
 and 
 events to apply the following restrictions:
- single appointment drag;
- appointments with the Paid status can be moved only between resources, so that their Start and End values remain unchanged;
- resizing is allowed for Unpaid status to change the End value.

                            

Hi,
We use the DashboardViewDataSourceFillService in our XAF integration of the dashboard.  As this service does not support non-persistent fields is there a way to remove these fields from the list of fields to select?  As the designer uses a regular collection it is possible to pick non-persistent fields when designing a dashboard which then causes the dashboard view to fail when it uses the DashboardViewDataSourceFillService.  Related to this issue, I don't see why the designer shows collection properties and marks them as not available (with the "x" icon) - why not just not show these fields?

Hello DevExpress team !
I'm trying to display custom objects in a Listbox. This object is a line with values about a measurement point (time, temperature, strenght..).
But, I can have 10 000 measurement points in the same file, and so, 10 000 lines.
If I try to load 10 000 line into the Listbox, my application is frozen for a while.
Do you have quick solution to :
-To load the objects in background application and do not freeze the HMI
or
-To load only the X first objects (the ones the operator can see on the screen), and load other measurement when the operator will scroll into the listbox  
Thank you in advance.
I wish you a good day !
Kind regards,

Hi,
I have a treeview with fixed depth (maximum level is 3, and all nodes on last level are leafs). I'm filling this tree manually via the settings.Nodes.Add() and loading works fine. Each node has a checkbox, and I use recursive checking, so, if I check a node with child nodes, they become checked too.
On the client side a have a js script attached to the treeview CheckedChanged event. It should list all checked leafs (nodes from level 3) as rows in other component.
 All works ok, when node was previously expanded to the full depth. If node was never expanded, in js GetNodeCount() for node returns 0.
I understand this behaviour when nodes are loading on demand, but in my case all nodes are already added to the treeview. Can you advise anything?
Thank you

Hi, 
I would like to render a page on desktop browser and mobile devices  (see attachment). I therefore use the following code:
settings.SettingsAdaptivity.AdaptivityMode = GridViewAdaptivityMode.HideDataCellsWindowLimit;
settings.SettingsAdaptivity.AdaptiveDetailLayoutProperties.
= false;
settings.SettingsAdaptivity.HideDataCellsAtWindowInnerWidth = 500;
settings.SettingsPopup.HeaderFilter.SettingsAdaptivity.Mode = PopupControlAdaptivityMode.OnWindowInnerWidth;
settings.SettingsPopup.HeaderFilter.SettingsAdaptivity.SwitchAtWindowInnerWidth = 500;
settings.SettingsPopup.HeaderFilter.SettingsAdaptivity.MinHeight = 300;
As you can see on the attachment, I have the following Problems with the device Rendering (right side, green arrows):
a) the colon is drawn, although I set "ShowItemCaptionColon" to false -> do I set the wrong property?
b) my first column has no title, but is shown in the list of columns (on top) -> can I hide this empty box somehow?
c) I would like to increase the size of my 2 image buttons in the first column, but only for the device width-> how can I achieve this?
Thanks a lot for your help!

That  user control also has a tabbed document. That control RestoreLayoutFromXml doesnt work as expected.
I included a video and a thin functional code i used in the video.

Hello. 
I'm would like to ask for your recommendation regarding the implementation of a chart. Please look at the attached sample. At the first glance, I would implement the chart using 3 bar series. Each bar will have the same point on the OX axis. 
A data point has 3 values. A percentage (gray), a numerator (black), a denominator(red). I would like to display each value as a bar.
But I'm not really sure how the chart will handle bar overlapping.
Do you have any tips or recommendations, by any chance? 
Thank you.

Hello,
I would like to ask for a bit of help regarding binding DataTable as DataSource of MVC GridVIew.
According to example 
  DataTable is a valid type for Grid's DataSource, but because of lack of parameter-less constructor for DataRow it's apparently not possible to add new records. My question is - is it possible to work around that limitation? I could create new object using DataTable.NewRow, but don't know how to provide it to the GridVIew. All I was able to find is InitNewRow event, but this seems to be used only for initializing fields of new object.
Best regards,
Sebastian 

Problem with displaying data in a grid with AutoWidth = true
Problem: the Wpf form is created, the data is loaded, but the display of the received data in the grid (gridcontrol) does not occur! The application loads one core of the processor as a whole indefinitely. 
Screenshot 1.
Here is the data from jetbrains dotTrace for three minutes waiting to display the data in the grid:
 Screenshot 2.
If you change the size of the form with the mouse (for example, drag the bottom side of the form down), then columns and data appear in the grid immediately.
 Screenshot 3.
On the form of two tabs. On the first tab there is a grid. On the second tab you will see the controls (DateEdit, LookUpEdit, etc.). XAML forms in the attachment.
The problem does not occur if you run one of the two:
1. Off AutoWidth, i.e. AutoWidth = false;
2. The height of the form to do more than necessary to draw controls on the second tab.
Any of these two decisions don't suit me! What can I do to solve this problem with rendering the grid?
Thanks,

Hi,
the cuestion is adout ASPxFileManager
 how can i add a new customcolumn with one field of one sql query
Regards 

Hello
 Looks like behavior of a grid editor is not correct in this case:
- multi selection is enabled for  the grid;
- cell select mode;
- EditorShowMode == Click;
- button or combo cell editor.
First click in a cell make it selected and a button is shown - all is correct. 
 Then click on the button selects all the text instead of showing a drop down list (or time, color ... picker).
 You can see it in XtraGrid Suite demo you supplied with the components, the screenshot is attached.
Is it possible to make the button work  with the first click on it in "Click" EditorShowMode?
 Best regards,

Hi,
Not sure if this is a bug with Treelist, Waitform or Print ?
i have a button with Waitform code below
  Private Sub SimpleButton2_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles SimpleButton2.Click
        'Open Wait Form
        SplashScreenManager.ShowForm(Me, GetType(WaitForm1), True, True, False)
        'The Wait Form is opened in a separate thread. To change its Description, use the SetWaitFormDescription method.
        For i As Integer = 1 To 100
            SplashScreenManager.Default.SetWaitFormDescription(i.ToString() & "%")
            Thread.Sleep(12)
        Next i
        'Close Wait Form
        SplashScreenManager.CloseForm(False)
    End Sub
The Waitform displays and works when calling node links with Tabpane Pages and gridcontrols
Example
If e.Node.Id = 5 Then
            SimpleButton2.PerformClick()
            TabPane2.Visible = True
            TabPane2.SelectedPageIndex = 7
        End If
However, calling a node linked to a report displays the Waitform (eventhough it is not called) 
Example
 If e.Node.Id = 7 Then
            Dim report As New PRS_List
            Dim printtool As ReportPrintTool = New ReportPrintTool(report)
            Dim lookandfeel As UserLookAndFeel = New UserLookAndFeel(Me)
            lookandfeel.UseDefaultLookAndFeel = False
            lookandfeel.SkinName = "Office 2016 Colorful"
            printtool.ShowRibbonPreview(lookandfeel)
          
        End If
But i would like to display the waitform for my gridcontrol treelist node links (not my report treelist node links). Why is the waitform being called for at Node 7 etc. 
thanks

Hi,
I'm programming app with XAF (Web & Windows) and created two different XPO-Classes. One class derived from built-in person XPO and the 2nd is an own class for representing a list of all german ZIP-codes and towns.
Now I want to assgin every object of my person class 1 to x entries of my prefilled ZIP-Code-class. For that I would like invoke an dialog, which represents all entries of ZIP-Code-Class in a list-view or tree view, so that the user can select one or more rows, that will added to the person class.
It should not be possible to create own entries in ZIP-Code-Class, the zip-codes are only a datasource for the invoked dialog to select and add.
The goal is, to assign towns and regions, the person is responsible for. e.g. a sales representative is responsible for Los Angeles, Chicago and Detroit. Another sales representative is responsible for Washington, Chicago and New York.
How can I achieve this? Do you have any example (code) or tutorial for that?
Thx for supporting me.
regards
Michael

I am having trouble getting the selected row values when they are grouped. I can get the values when they are not grouped but as soon as you group by a column the selected rows gets 2 indexes. This is causing a problem for my current set up. So trying to account for checking if the row is grouped I have used .IsGroupRow() to check. From there I am having trouble finding the answer on how to access the selected rows values. I plan to loop through each row to extract the column values I need but I have not been able to find any documentation on how to do this exactly. I am using .GetRowCellValue() to obtain these column values when they are not grouped and that is working correctly. Any direction/help would be appreciated.
Cheers,
Danny

Hi,
Is it the intended functionality that when I collapse a grouped row (see screen shot), the listening event "OnSelectionChanged" is triggered?
For me, the "OnSelectionChanged" event is fired, and the (e) that is passed in has a "CurrentlySelectedList" that does not contain any rows in the collapsed group, even if they were selected.
This is making my custom OnSelectionChanged handler to think that when you collapse a group, you de-select all of that group's rows.
Is this something that can be prevented?
Or if it's not an intended functionality, do you know of what may be causing this to happen?
Thank you 

I have a grid whose columns are dynamically added on load. I am trying the batch edit functionality and wants to save only modified column values in a row. 
The row updating event provides me old and new values for all columns

{
} 
How could we find only modified columns values in this event. My number of columns could grow to be hundred with multiple rows, so i don't want to match each column value one by one (this will have a performance hit)  and update only modified values in database.

At design time, the font size for an editor is set incorrectly when it's style is assigned a style controller. This happens when designing at 120 PPI.
The Delphi IDE is running with the monitor scale set to 120 PPI.
There is a datamodule containing a TcxEditStyleController.
The StyleController's Style font is set to Segoe UI, 9 point (height is consequently set to -15).
The StyleController's Scalable property is set to true.
There is a form with pixelsperinch set to 120.
The user places an editor, for example a TcxLabel, on the form.
The editor's style.stylecontroler is set to the StyleController from the datamidule.
The editor's font size is scaled so that the size is set to 7 (height is consequently set to -12)..
If the editor's style font property is set directly to Segoe 9 point, it is displayed as expected in the form designer. It is only after assinging the style controller that the font is scaled down.
Displaying the form and datamodule as text confrms that the pixelsperinch value is 120).
Note that when the editor is hosted in a frame rather than a form, the problem does not occur.

I have the following requirement in my grid...
1. when the user TABs thru the cells in the row and reaches the last cell, tabbing once more must add a new row in the grid.
2. TABBING must continue in the new row and cycle should repeat
3. when user presses ESC, focus must come out of current cell and the context row must be selected.
4. Pressing TAB again must move focus out of grid to the next control.
Any idea of how to accomplish this?

Hi,
I have a TimeSpanEdit control in my form and it is setup to show only days, through the following code at the form startup:
I?m trying to write two subs in VB.Net, one to get the curr ent date value set in the control and another to set a defined amount of days in the control. Both subs return the amount of days in a messagebox.
This code is working (Read the number of days from the TimeSpanEdit control and shown in a messagebox)
This code is NOT working for me (Set the number of days in the control - Here I?m trying to set it with exact 4 days)
When the code above runs, the control is set with a value of 736738 as the number of days, rather than 4 as I expect.
What am I doing wrong?

We have today installed visual studio and as apart of an existing subscription we have with you, we installed the .NET framework components too.
We are unable to use the shipped databases with your demo projects because of our version of MSSQL SQL Server.

We are particularly interested in your dashboard demos. We would ideally like to see the project as it shows on your website - to get an idea of what code is required etc, is this something you can provide us with specifically:

Is it possible to "add" to reflection dictionary a real POCO objects without decorating these with [Persistent] attribute? I've tried to do something  like this:

The IDE is run on a monitor scaled to 120 PPI. Therefore, all forms and fonts have pixelsperinch set to 120.
A frame instance is created at run time.
The frame is parented on a form.
When the frame is loaded, the fonts for the controls on the frame are scaled to the default PPI of 96. (We use style controlers / style sheets which are hosted in datamodules also designed at 120 PPI). This is fine.
However, the position and dimensions of the controls in the frame are not scaled, and the current PPI is set to 96. The effect of this is that when the frame is parented on a form, the controls within the frame appear with the correct font size, but the position and dimensions are scaled up by 25%.
I suspect that this is the result of the fact that a TFont has a pixelsperinch property, but a frame does not.
As a workaround, I tried to scale the frame after it has been loaded, using ChangeScale, however this changes the font scale as well as the position and dimension, so the fonts end up being 25% too small. TControl.ChangeScale uses the default scaling flags which include sfFont.
I would like to have a way to tell the TdxFrameController what the design time PPI is for a frame, and to have the frame scaled appropriately when it is loaded.

Hello,
I'm struggling on centering the wait form on the parent form.
I have  a parent form(Form1) for example.
When I launch the wait form it doesn't display on the center of the parent form. 
splashScreenManager1.ShowForm(Me, GetType(WaitForm1), False, False, SplashFormStartPosition.Manual, Me.PointToScreen(Me.Location))
What Am I doing wrong?
Thanks

Hi,
I translated all function names and put then  to my unit, see sample below.
It mostly works. The problem is with BOOLEAN constants. When I put 
 to a cell and press ENTER it changes to 
 (centered in a cell). Now when I edit it (text TRUE) it is treated as string. Where to translate to be able to see my translated text instead of English source?

Hello Team,
We use richtext editor mvc extension to open docx files.
When I click into table,, by default it shows design and layout tabs. I would like to keep those tabs, but do not want to give my users all the formatting options in the design/layout tabs.
For example, I want to hide table styles. In borders & shading show only borders but remove shading s options.
Please let me know how can I achieve this. 
Thanks for your time.

Hi DevExpress,
I have  a need for accessing data objects inside my ERP system that can't be (easily) accessed by pulling SQL fields out from the SQL database.
The fields are defined in a code layer inside the ERP (using ERP specific language) ie. a table can have a number of fields but also added some methods, that can return strings/numbers/compound objects/etc. useable inside the ERP system.
 But these methods can be accessed (/returned) using Business Connector .NET calls  from C# and then you get a single value returned by calling a complex method inside the ERP, that does all the internal calculations etc.
So can I connect to  the SQL database, extract most of my fields but also define "fields" that will be returned values from calls into ERP logic! and get these values "put on paper" - I will need values of current records as parameters into the ERP, something like this:
double erpvalue = CallIntoERP(currentvalue_from _specific table, ..., ...);
If so can you share an example!? 
 

Hi,
Setting OptionsView.ZeroValues := False makes FALSE values in cells invisible. While excel doesn't.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Put dxSpreadSheet onto form
2) Set in design time  OptionsView.ZeroValues := False
3) Run program, enter word FALSE to any cell, press E NTER
4) Value was hidden 

Good evening, 
I am developing my application using XAF and in the web side of my application I created a custom view that uses the WebChartControl to visualize data. In this chart though the values between one argument and the other have a very big delta and the bars are therefor extremely high for the one very high value and really low (almost invisible) for all the other values. How can I apply some kind of "leveling" calculation to my series so that the bars represent the value difference in a not so drastic manner? Otherwise, would you suggest an other type of series?
Thanks,
Pablo.

Hello,
I use view controller  to customize list view of an object. in this case I need to change columns displayed and rename them.

Hello Support Center,
I am working on a project and notice an interesting occurrence that I can not pin-point.  On initial load of a form/control which contains a grid with a child advanced banded grid view, a row selection can be made.  This then moves the row to the nearest top of the grid.  After this initial selection, the grid maintains row placement and does not auto-scroll.  I would prefer this to not happen and maintain the general placement of the row.  I have attached a sample project with screen shot samples embedded in the zip.  
Thank you for your help!

I use GridLookupEdit as ColumnEdit to let users select some item with a multi-column search.
I also want to change the items in the list depending on what row we are.
When I try to change ActiveFilter, this have no effect ont the popup GridLookupEdit. It is like the GridLookupEdit object I have in the code is not the same that is displayed on the screen!
If I set a value to ActiveFilter, it's working only if I do it before the first time the GridLookupEdit  is displayed. After this, all change I tried to do by code have no effect on screen. I try to change ActiveFilterString, ColumnInfo on some column, and also NonColumnFilter.
 I also tried at different time, and in the ShownEditor event. nothing works.
If I change the filter in the UI in the FilterRow, and after I put a breakpoint to inspect GridLookupEdit's properties, I can see that value for filtering properties (ActiveFilter, ActiveFilterString, ...) reflect the new value I setted by code, but on the screen initial filter stay there.
I also tried by adding "View.RefreshData"  (
) , no more success.
 
What i'm missing ?

I would like to build a treeview that loads data on demand. But the data for each level comes from different data sources and not the same one.
For instance:
The first data source populates the first level of the treeview, upon expanding a node, an api call/different data source provides children for that particular node and so on. 
How can this be achieved? 

I have a report with a group header that should repeat every page if a parameter is true. In the BeforePrint event of my report, I need to inspect the value of the parameter and set the value of GroupHeader1.RepeatEveryPage like this:




I have tried different approaches to inspect the value of this parameter, but all I can get to is "StringCollection". I can see the value in debug.
How can I get the actual value assigned to the parameter?
Thank you for your help.

Hi,
when user enters value to cell which previously had other font, the font is lost and set to default. Another editing makes cell invisible.
Steps to reproduce.
1) put SpreadSheet on a form
2) run program
3) enter any text or number to a cell, i.e. Test, press ENTER
4) change font: use context menu on this cell, select  Format Cells, go to Font, Select Times New Roman, press OK
- now font has changed
5) in the same cell enter new value (don't edit previous): abcd, press ENTER
- font went back to previous one
Hint: once on the list is Times New Roman, second time it appears as Times New Roman CE.
If I use Consolas font face, problem does not appear.
Screen cast attached.

It seems to be an inconsistency in RowObjectEventArgs  properties value when ADDING new row in XtraGrid.
I first get a "InitNewRow" event, who have e.RowHandle value  -2147483647. In this event I can call GetRow(-2147483647) to obtain the row, cast it and set some initial values.
But problem comes when I get the "RowUpdated" event when new row is completed (User change row for example). Inside the event, the e.RowHandle (and also gridViewLocations.FocusedRowHandle) have value  -2147483647. But when I call GetRow, I get a null...
If later the user modify content of the row (who is no longer a "new row"), then I get "RowUpdated" with a valid RowHanfle, for exemple "4", then can get the Row.
How can I get the new added row to do my works ?   I have to change some properties depending on the value of others.
 
------------------------------------------
        private void gridViewLocations_RowUpdated(object sender, DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.RowObjectEventArgs e)
        {
            var data = gridViewLocations.GetRow (e.RowHandle);     // always null on new row
            if (data != null)
                _DemandeControleur.Rep.RowUpdatedLocations(data);
        }

Is there any way to provide a per-row message for the delete confirmation box? I tried using the onRowRemoving event handler, but it's fired after the confirmation box appears.
I'd rather not make something completely custom when DX already offers the confirmation functionality.
Here is my handler code:

I am wondering if there is a way to set each Point's legend text individually  inside a Pie chart. I need this to accomplish the following scenario:
I have a pie chart which displays wedges based on the number of records which have values within a given range. 
I would like to display legend text for each wedge in the chart based on its range like so: "<Argument> <RangeMin>-<RangeMax> <Percentage of Total>"
Here are some of the issues I've run into and what I've tried:
1.) 
When I attempt to format the legend text as written above, the legend will display the average of the minimum and maximum value instead of the Min + "-" + Max. This occurs even if I explicitly set the LegendTextPattern to display a static value. You can see an example of this in the first attached image.
2.) 
When attempting to set the legend text for each point individually, it seems to set the legend text for the whole series.  I have tried to do this using the Series.LegendTextPattern as there does not seem to be a property which I can set each Wedge's legend text. In addition, I have also tried overriding the CustomDrawSeriesPoint method and setting the CustomDrawSeriesPointEventArgs.LegendText as well and noticed the same result. To illustrate this point, I have overridden the CustomDrawSeriesPoint method to set the  CustomDrawSeriesPointEventArgs.LegendText to a random integer for each point, however each legend item would display only the last Point's integer in the legend.
Any help you can give would be appreciated.

Hi there,
I am trying to create a "text box" that has custom syntax highlighting which makes the text between the "{}" blue and bold. The element in the {} are dragged from a tree list.
I have  tried the Rich Edit Control. I want to be able to bind the text to a variable in the viewmodel, but I have not figure out the way to do it.
Then I tried to use RichTextBox. I was able  bind the text and use an event handler for "TextChanged" to make the custom syntax highlighting, but there are some very curious things happening.
Here is my code for the event handler:
The first drop works fine. But if I do a second drop, all the text after the first "{" will be copies to the end of the line.
An example would be:
    Original text: 123
    Dropping "{Text1}" between 1 and 2: 1{Text1}23
    Dropping "{Text2}" between 2 and 3: 1{Text1}2{Text2}3{Text1}23
If I comment out the two "ApplyPropertyValue" lines at the end, the drag and drop works perfectly.
Could you give some suggestions on what is causing the problem mentioned above? 
I am trying to learn about RichEditControl, but I haven't got much luck searching online. Could you advise me on how to properly binding string variable in the viewmodel to the RichEditControl?
Thank you very much for the help.
 

Hi,
I'm trying to add Chart Controls to my WPF application, and am following the instructions here:
When I get to step 2 and click "Data Source Wizard," Visual Studio's designer says An Exception was thrown:
Making a change to the XAML or building the project reinitiates the designer to show the chart again, but clicking the Data Source Wizard throws the exception.
This is happening with a new blank WPF application and in my existing application. Any leads on what the issue might be? Please let me know if I can provide any further information.

Hi,
Once the column width is expanded by double clicking it, the column width can not be reduced back to its original width. A second double on the expanded column causes the width to exceed the width of the displayed grid.

Chosen colors in the color table for Pie charts will change from the desktop designer to the web viewer when there are 2 or more Values and a hidden measure in the pie chart. Remove the hidden measure and the colors carry over to the web as they should.
 

In desktop dashboard designer using Devex 17.2.5, in a grid with hyperlinks, if you conditionally format the hyperlink column and color the background, you must attach the formatting rule to the URI column and not the display value column so the formatting will be seen in the web viewer once published.  **This will cause the formatting to be blank in the designer, but it will show on the web. The opposite is true if you attach the rule to the Display Value - the formatting will show in the desktop designer but not online.  

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function OnRichEditInit(s, e) {
            var inputElement = document.getElementsByClassName("dxre-inputTarget")[0];
            if (inputElement.localName == "iframe")
                inputElement = inputElement.contentDocument || inputElement.contentWindow.document;
            ASPxClientUtils.AttachEventToElement(inputElement, "keypress", function (e) {
                console.log(e.keyCode);
            });
        }

When exporting a GridControl containing a TreeListView with hierarchical data, and a GridColumn with SparklineEditSettings, the export via TreeListView.ExportToXslx(filename) throws a ArgumentOutOfRangeException. See minimal example that reproduces the issue in the attachment (you will have to change the hardcoded filename to match your environment in MainWindow.xaml.cs).
It would be great if you could provide a fix or workaround.
Thanks!

I created a dashboard that uses and Excel Data Source and saved the Dashboard as an xml file. Then i created a Winforms app and loaded the xml file in a Dashboard viewer. Each week we want to select a new spreadsheet with the same schema that has new data. I've been struggling for more than a week trying to get the dashboard to refresh with a new data source. The Dashboard viewer always shows data associated with the original Excel file.
I've tried using event handlers like LoadingData, tried the refresh() method, changing data sources after the following code snippet:
 
                var dashboard2 = new Dashboard();
                DashboardViewer dashboardViewer2 = new DashboardViewer();
                dashboardViewer2.Dashboard = dashboard2;
                dashboardViewer2.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
                tabControl1.TabPages["tabPage2"].Controls.Add(dashboardViewer2);
                dashboardViewer2.LoadDashboard(@"C:\Metrics\Prototype2.xml");
                DashboardExcelDataSource excelDataSource = new DashboardExcelDataSource("NewExcelData");
                excelDataSource.FileName = openFileDialog1.FileName;
                ExcelWorksheetSettings worksheetSettings = new ExcelWorksheetSettings("DocQuery");
                excelDataSource.SourceOptions = new ExcelSourceOptions(worksheetSettings);
                excelDataSource.Fill();   

Hello,
I am having an issue with loading the DataSources into a dashboard.  I have the basics working - I can save and load a dashboard to a database field.  I can launch the dashboard designer and viewer forms.  It works and works well.  However, I am having an issue when loading datasources for the dashboard. 
In my case - the user runs a SQL query - it generates a DataTable(s) and that/those are used as the datasources for the Dashboard.  I save the SQL and the dashboard definition to a Database record to be used again in the future. This part works well.  
Now - take the example of SQL1 being run and generating DataTable1.  This is then used to design the dashboard.  
Then at a later time I rerun SQL1 - but also run SQL2 - generating two DataTables (DataTabl1 and DataTable2).  Then I load the previously designed dashboard into the dashboard designer. I get one of two issues happening - depending on whether I clear the DataSources or not (after I load the saved dashboard). 
Do not Clear the DataSources:
At this point I end up with the following DataTables (data sources)
     DataTable1
     DataTable1
     DataTable2
AND - the dashboard designer displays the data and works as expected.  BUT - that second copy of DataTable1 in the list is confusing for my users
Clear the DataSoures
At this point I end up with the following DataTables (data sources)
     DataTable1
     DataTable2
So - the DataSources list is correct - but now there is no data available in the designer and all my dashboard items are blank.
I realize this has to do with the clearing of the DataSources - and the fact that I am manually loading the DataSources at run time - from the list of available DataTables in a DataSet.  However, I have to admit - I don't understand how this is supposed to function well enough to come up with the proper solution...
I have attached a zip file with my DashboardDesigner form - and some images to show the issue.  
In the designer form - I am doing the following
OnLoad of the Form - I do
     Load Dashboard from Database  (here I realize I am getting the datasource that was used the last time in the designer)
     Load Dashboard DataSources  (here I am adding the current ones - if I don't clear I get a duplicate...  If I do clear - the designer does not show data).
I am guessing that when I clear the datasources - I am screwing up the reference to the DataSource that the Dashboard has from the previous design session. Hence why the dashboard items are blank.   And since the design that is loaded from the DB already has a datasource - and then I try to reload it - I get why I am seeing the duplication.  
My question is how to do I solve the duplication issue properly???  I think I could not clear the datasources - but only load ones that do not already exist (by comparing the DataSourceName to the DataTableName.  That seems a little like a hack - and I thought I would check with you folks to see if there was a more 'proper' way of doing this???    
Thank you.
Bradley

Hi I have existing client side javascript code to populate other columns of the grid when the combobox is selected. ie
This has been working but for some reason I don't know it crashes with the selection of the Date_Assigned being set.  
Now its defined and its not null so is their a server side way to populate fields from the aspxcomboboxcolumn selection from the datasource fields collection ? 

We are converting all our javascript code to typescript, including the code where we utilize devExtreme.
We are getting errors with the following command 
function newIOIDataGrid(_config) {
    return $("#dxDataGridContainer").dxDataGrid(_config).dxDataGrid("instance");
}
where _config is a object containing the configuration for the datagrid.
The error :
Error TS2339 Property 'dxDataGrid' does not exist on type 'dxDataGrid'. 
A colleague tried the followiing code to replace the return statement in the above function, but as I expected, that doesn't work
return (<DevExpress.ui.dxDataGrid>DataGrid).instance();
Any thoughts on how to deal with this situation. Please note that we currently chain together functions in a similar for a number of different widgets, like dxPopup and dxButton . I suspect the solution would apply to any devExtreme widget.
Thanks
 

I am having trouble getting the selected row values when they are grouped. I can get the values when they are not grouped but as soon as you group by a column the selected rows gets 2 indexes. This is causing a problem for my current set up. So trying to account for checking if the row is grouped I have used .IsGroupRow() to check. From there I am having trouble finding the answer on how to access the selected rows values. I plan to loop through each row to extract the column values I need but I have not been able to find any documentation on how to do this exactly. I am using .GetRowCellValue() to obtain these column values when they are not grouped and that is working correctly. Any direction/help would be appreciated.
Cheers,
Danny

I have a form with a Snap Control on it. I'm seeing an error that's new on some PCs when closing this form. A nullreferenceexception occurs in this method -- I can't reproduce it on my machine but I've watched it happen on others. The DataExplorer pane will go white as this occurs, so I'm quite sure its in there somewhere. Will try to get more info but maybe worth looking at ;)

Please note that this issue only occurs in IE (Chrome works fine).
We have a page which has both an ASP GridView and a DevExpress ASPxGridView.  As part of a recent change we made the ASPxGridView a Batch edit grid.  Upon doing so, the ASP GridView when viewed in IE, is no longer able to enter Edit Mode.
Please see the attached project, where the Edit button doesn't work when viewed in IE.  If the Batch mode is removed on the ASPXGridView,  then the Edit button will work again.  Obviously, we are just looking for a way to get this to work in IE.

Hi,
I'm trying to replace  placeholders in the body of a richeditcontrol with arabic text but the direction of the replaced text is unconsistent (some are correct, some aren't).. The attachment shows a sample (the right panel is the original page which you can check with)
How can I get the correct direction simultaneously for both the replaced (arabic) and latin/english text?
Thanks
Orhan

If you use a DevExpress.XtraBars.Docking.DockPanel on WIn10 and set Scale and Layout to 125% or 150% 
the DockPanel title fonts get messed up.
Is there a fix for this issue? 

Good afternoon,
I have an XtraTabControl and sometimes I need to enable / disable it. Tab control has multiple pages, each page may have other tab controls inside it . Each child tab control has one or multiple pages with scroll control and layout control in it. Every time when I am set Enable = true or false, it takes long time to refresh the screen. SuspendLayout, BeginUpdate doesn't work it seems.
Regards, 

For reference:

Hi,
I am using a checkedComboBoxEdit. When all items are selected the default behavior is that the checkedComboBoxEdit value is a string of  all the items in its list. I want a different behavior. I want to set its value to '' (empty string). How do I do that in VB.NET code?

Hey guys, I have created a very simple project to test out some of your controls. I have tested some date controls, textboxes, etc. They all work well. I was interested in using your form control as it makes creating a data entry screen much easier. However, whenever I put a form control onto my view, it just loads the view forever. 
 I am using ASP core 2 Razor Pages.
This solution was created by, creating a ASP Core 2 project, then I right clicked the project and in the context menu selected "Add DevExtreme to the project". I followed the instructions in there and changed _ViewStart to: @{
    Layout = "_DevExtremeLayout";
}
Here is my pages code:
and here is the code behind:

I am using a TreeListView bound to an EF datasource using a HierarchicalDataTemplate.  When I load the data I am doing an order by on a property called Sequence which is an integer.  Everything is displaying properly.  If I drag a node to change the sequence, the treeview works as expected, but I need to programmatically recalculate the sequence numbers and save to the database.  I have code to do this based on the order of the items in the collection.  I have a button that runs this code and it if I click it after dragging to change the order of the nodes it works.  But I can not seem to find an event of the TreeListView that fires after the collection is changed so that the user does not have to click the button.  I have tried CompleteRecordDragDrop but this is still too early, the order of items in the collection still has not changed.  Is there another event that fires later after the datasource had finished updating?
I have another related question.  If I drag a node to another parent, the item in the underlying datasource is moved to the proper parent collection.  But the EF navigation properties are not updated.  Should it be updating the navigation properties automatically, or do I need to do that myself in the same way I would need to update the sequence property above?
Thanks. 

This project is from question: ID: T266849. I was using it as a guide for this functionality. The columns headers in the project are not wrapped.

I'm trying to create a left-aligned "Home" button in a DocumentManager's TabbedView in a WinForms MDI application, as shown in the attached (Photoshop) mockup.  From the following support tickets, it doesn't appear that this is possible currently:
 If it is not possible, is there a different strategy that I could use with DevExpress WinForms tools to achieve the same effect with an MDI application so that I preserve a never-closing, custom-painted, Home tab (or button)?

Hi,
We are using the PrintableControlLink to print a pivotGrid.  (see code below)
This had been working without issue till recently - I'm guessing it was the update to 17.2.5 tht broke it.  
the error message is: All rectangle borders must have the same thickness.  In addition, any border can have a zero thickness, which means the border is invisible.
Could it be related to T595414? 
I need a quick fix for this as it is affecting production code.

Habib

Guys,
I have serious problem that costed me several days of working for nothing. I lost all my nerves until we find out what is problem, and I don't know what caused it.
On my machine default font is 7.8, and on the computers of my colleagues is 8.25 - for example.
The biggest problem is that one is shown in designer, and another in application. 
You can see attached pictures...
It is very important for me to have everything in correct size, and it is very difficult to do that when designer and app show different things.
How  can I fix this?
Thank you,
Hristina 

Hi
We have a control in our application, running on touch tablets, that takes a tap drag to draw a line/signature. This control seems to be losing single tap focus when contained within DocumentManager. It works fine when using a mouse and acts as expected. Also when not using the DocumentManager the control works fine with touch on the tablets.
Please find attached two projects. One with DocumentManager, one without. They are very much identical except for using DocumentManger.
This control worked fine on touch tablets with DevExpress 14.2.3 (I think it was .3, at the very least it was 14.2) where the single tap was taken correctly and the line was drawn. However in DevExpress 17.1.6 it requires the tablet user to doubletap and hold for a tiny bit then drag to draw the same line. 
I would like to make it function with a single tap as how it used to function however I cannot currently find any way to get it to work on tablets as it did previously. Any suggestions?
Thanks,
Taran

4. Memory does not decrease. 

In the application that we've been building we've been using code like the following for editor popups in grids
 Works fine when running with ng build. However, when trying to do a production build (ng build --prod), we are getting a litany of errors like:
What do we need to do to make this work with a production Angular build? 

My master and detailed grid both have bind to same type ObservableCollection<OrdersViewModel> 
My Master grid is below and see SelectedItems binded to Parent ViewModel property SelectedItems which is of same type ObservableCollection<OrdersViewModel>
In details section of parent grid I have another grid which same type ObservableCollection<OrdersViewModel> and inner grid's selected item is also binded to same SelectedItems as parent i.e. SelectedItems="{Binding Path=DataContext.SelectedItems, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=dxg:GridControl}}"
Now if I am expanding Details section and selecting a row in inner grid I'm getting selectedItems correctly as inner grid's selected row. After selecting inner grid row if I want to select some other row of parent grid it's again working find and selectedItems is correctly updated with parent grid's row. However if after selecting inner grid row if I want to select same row which contains the inner grid it's not updating selectedItems. 
I tried using CollectionChanged event but it's not triggered when parent row is selected after selecting inner grid row. Also tried  FocusedRowChanged,  FocusedViewChanged, but these are also not getting triggered.

Hi Team,
I have a scenario where I would like to deal with Sparse Matrix, and I want Grid to replicate the same. Are there any possibility or workarounds?  
I tried various approaches (reading from old support articles) but nothing worked for my case. I tried  overriding the behavior in

 and few other but couldn't able to achieve what I want. I have attached my effort, please help.
I really appreciate any help on this.

Since i updated my DevExpress from version 17.1.2 to version 17.2.4 i get a memoryleak in cxControls.
The leak appears if you have a grid and just scroll up and down with the new introduced scrollbars.
If i set theTouchScrollUIMode property of a LookAndFeelController to FALSE the leaks are gone.
I attach a  simple projekt to reproduce the leak. Just run the program an scroll up and down.
In the attached archive i also uploaded the reported leak report from MadExcept. 

I have a Report bound to an object with some detail reports on it. I want to hide a detail report if the list of objects bound to it is empty or null.
In the designer i have this code:
However the formatting rule is ignored, and the detail report is always print, no matter is empty or not.
Also, I Have take noticed thaht, despite i have created the formating rules thru the designer, after close and reopen the desing view. The list of formatting rules is empty, despite the still present on the designer code.
Please see the attached captures 

In the example attached below there is an interactive graph.
 
I would like to do the same but whilst using databinding.  Eg the XAML code
 and the ViewModel
If I use your example the code from the example it modifies the SeriesPoint however it doesn't update the graph.
 

Dear support,
When searching a value in a dxTagBox widget that isn't present, the popup should open and show the "No data to display" value.
In this build it opens but closes immediately. This is not desirable and doesn't match the rest of the widgets.
Is it possible to fix this issue.
Thanks in advance
Hans

PivotGridControl.RefreshData

Is there a way to initialize the memory?


hi Andrey,
Thanks for that. I was able to fix the issue but i have another issue with same paramaters

how can i remove the time from data.
my parameter data type is date.

Hello, how can I change width and height of the my inherited TcxSchedulerEventModernInfoContainer??? 

Hello,
i have a XtraGrid which display some values:
Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3
1              |  1              | 1
2              | 2               | 2
The values in the grid are changing in a very short time span (for example every 10 ms).
Now it should be possible for the user to define the column width by left click on the space between two headers and drag and drop  to the wanted width.
When the data are not changing it is not a problem, but when they change the user can't do that.
 I have tried some ways (not on the same time)
 on Mouse down event of the GridControl
1.) set DataSource = null,
 On Mouse down event of the GridView:
1.) BeginUpdate
2.) BeginDataUpdate
On the Mouse up event i have reverse every try. 
 How does i make it correctly?
Best Regards
Stefan

Hello,
What I have:
PopupControl acting as a login form, lifted straight from your Modal PopupControl demo. It has email and password feels, along with submit and cancel buttons.
What I want:
When the user clicks submit button, I have a callback go to the controller .
Controller takes email and password from textboxes in the LoginPopup and uses them to query my database for a matching user account.
If a user account is retrieved, I close the modal PopupControl - if no user account exists for the email/password combo, I do not close the popupcontrol.
How can I do this?
I currently have everything set up, except I cannot figure out how to close the popup from the controller. Do you have advice as to how to do this? 
Controller:
 public ActionResult LoginPopup(string email, string password)
        {
            ViewData["UserLoggedIn"] = false;
            var user = DataAccess.GetUserByEmailAndPassword(email, password);
            if (user != null)
            {
                ViewData["UserLoggedIn"] = true;
            }   
            return PartialView();
        }
View:
settings.ShowOnPageLoad = true;
        object userLoggedIn;
        if (ViewData.TryGetValue("UserLoggedIn", out userLoggedIn))
        {
            if ((bool)userLoggedIn)
            {
                settings.ShowOnPageLoad = false;
            }
        }
Thoughts:
I thought setting ShowOnPageLoad to false would have made this PopupControl disappear, but it doesnt.
I also thought that maybe I could do something with an EndCallback, but I can't figure out how to pass the boolean from the controller to the EndCallback. 
I've looked through a lot of help tickets, but none of them seem to be for MVC, and I do not know how to adapt what they suggest, besides the two courses of action I just outlined.
Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

Hi,
when I try to change font face to Wingdings 2 using code below it works. But when I load any xlsx file (freshly created in Excel 2007) and try to do the same for any cell, it is not changed. For some other fonts it worked ok.
Cell stores new font name but is not rendered correctly. It seems that this font is not seen after loading file.
  

I cannot find in the 
 a way to handle the event corresponding to clicking on the clear button in a DxDropDownBoxComponent.

I was looking for some kind of "(onClearButtonClicked)=myfunction($event)".
I need indeed to commit some action when the use clear the dropbox field.
Any lead ?
Thank you

Hi,
after upgrading from v15.1.8 to v17.1.8 we noticed another change. When scrolling with the mouse wheel, the grid and tree list used to scroll the parent control too. Now, if the grid or tree list has the focus, the parent control is not scrolled anymore. Good if the grid or tree list  has scrollbars too, not so good if they don't.
So we started to look and found a workaround for grids by throwing the HideException in the MouseWheel event. However this does not work for tree lists. Is there any way to achieve the same behavior in tree lists?
Best regards,
Tobias Lingemann

1) When I create an appointment, I want it to have some default values. To achive this I use the following code:

2) In legacy version Both Resources where shown when the user grouped the Scheduler by Resource. In this version you must click on a small "+" sign that appears at the bottom of the Scheduler to show both resources in the same space, otherwise you must use the scrollbar. I want to show both resources by default. Is there any propery to adjust that behavior? I have not found any.
I think that's all for now. Thank you very much for your time.

I have a RibbonForm with the properties RibbonStyle = MacOffice and RightToLeft = Yes
I Added buttons to the quickaccess toolbar to be at the top-right corner, and I realize that the SuperTips are aligned to the right, and I want them left aligned as I can see always in normal ribbon configurations.
Please, find attached and image with the result I can see. Even the final dot at the end of my tooltip at design time is shown in the left side.
Could you help me to configure them to see them left aligned?
Thanks!!!

I'm trying to implement keyboard navigation in dxDataGrid. I've succeeded to implement navigation by using Up, Down, Home, and End keys, but the issue is it's only moving through data grid rows without real selection that is when I navigate something should happen - some content should be displayed in content area. But, it doesn't happen. It happens only if I select particular row by mouse.
My question is - how to make real selection of particular row by using keyboard navigation?

Hi,
I am currently working on the implementation of filter translation on my custom store. This means that I need to create the filter string for my rest api with the informations I get from the DevExpress.data.LoadOptions.filter. Our api does not support all of the available conditions and groups and so I would like to disable some of them. Is this already possible ?
 

Hi,
We are using the xpf navigation controls and wondered how we can reduce the  size of the border around each of the TileNavItem & TileNavSubItem controls.

I use XPO with SQLCE 4.0.
If I create a new dataobject with decimal?, the value is shown as expected.
But if I save the object and restart the application, the value is shown with 4 digits after decimal point.
Example:
-value: 4 
-saved: 4.0000
How can I avoid this behavior without using a mask for the spinedit.
I made a small example and a video.

I want to export the data from a gridcontrol to excel, but what ever I try, it keeps rounding values to 2 decimals??
I have this code:

Good morning,
Is it possible for the new DXScheduler to automatically scroll down to the  current time when today is selected? At the moment, the Scheduler won't scroll down automatically and so the user has to scroll down manually to the current time to view current appointments. We had this functionality on the legacy Scheduler.
Thanks!

I have a databound TreeView populated via a SQL query.
So far so good. But the data is shown like a datagrid.
But what i want is to show the data as a real TreeView.
Like :

                Discipline V
                     Task 1
                Discipline W

I think I have found a bug with the CircularGaugeControl. I drop one onto my window and I end up with a pre-configured setup that includes a needle with the attribute IsInteractive="True". When I run the application, I can drag the needle around - this works correctly.
Now I set IsInteractive to False. At runtime, I can't drag the needle anymore - but each time I click the needle, it jumps to a random new location on the gauge. I see that the location isn't truly random - when I click the needle somewhere to the right of its rendering, it jumps to the right, and vice versa. But I expect nothing to happen at all... 

Both of the above dialog's do not filter the display of existing files based on the filter applied. This seems to be intermittent as though some caching is occurring.
I've switched from zip to XML files and the dialogs are now displaying both  types of file.
My code is here. Am I not setting the filter correctly? Also see the attached images
 

Hey,
I have the problem, that if I group on a column which has only one value and ungroup it, the first line gets corrupted.
This is only working with a certain setting of gridview.
I provided you a demo.Steps to repro:
Group on TypeTry.
Ungroup TypeTry.
You will see the problem in the first column

Hi,
I'm using the TcxColorComboBox to display several colors in the drop down menu.
The TcxColorComboBox is made of two parts, the box filled with the color and its name. This is my situation:
[ YELLOW ]   clYellow                                     (starting color)
[ BLACK ]   clBlack
[ YELLOW  ]   clYellow
[ RED ]   clRed
[ LIME ]   clLime
[ COLOR] By Layer <--------------------------- I need the color box of this row   to be filled with BLACK, YELLOW, RED or LIME named as By Layer.
In this way, I can have two rows with the same color box but with different names.
Apparently, the TcxColorComboBox doesn't allow me to display the same color more time in the drop down.
Is it possible to achieve this?
Cordially,
Gianluigi 

File filter not working in XtraOpenFileDialog.

Another question, because i have no columns defined and only row area and many data areas, the pivot grid actually looks like a datagrid, is there any way i can paginate this instead of using virtual scrolling?

I want to use the group summary of the GridControl to update data in the group rows. To do so I used a custom summary and the GroupSummaryItemTemplate of the TableView of my GridControl. In the CustomSummary event I created my own type I placed it in the TotalValue of the CustomSummaryEventArgs object with the data I need to feed the combobox. In the template I display the combobox and bind the ItemsSource and SelectedItem with my data I found in the Value property of the GridGroupSummaryData. Then I use the SelectionChange event of my ComboBox to update the rows of the group. So far everything is working well except my combobox is not aligned with my column.
So to align my combobox I put the GroupSummaryDisplayMode property to AlignByColumns and used the GroupColumnSummaryItemTemplate instead of the GroupSummaryItemTemplate. But I don't retrieve my own object in the Value property of GridGroupSummaryColumnData. The binding don't work and I have errors "System.Windows.Data Error: 40 : BindingExpression path error: 'CountriesList' property not found on 'object' ''String' (HashCode=757602046)'. BindingExpression:Path=Value.CountriesList; DataItem='GridGroupSummaryColumnData' (HashCode=1344915); target element is 'ComboBox' (Name=''); target property is 'ItemsSource' (type 'IEnumerable')" on the output window of VS. I think it's a bug because I don't understand why the Value property is a string instead of me own class like in the GridGroupSummaryData class.
I did a sample application so you can see the problem. when you start the application you have just to group a column ("married" column is a good candidate) to see the combobox and the binding errors. To see a fonctionnal version of what I want to do you can remove the GroupSummaryDisplayMode property and replace GroupColumnSummaryItemTemplate by GroupSummaryItemTemplate in the xaml file.
In subsidiary question is there a way to retreive the group rows from the GridGroupSummaryColumnData or GridGroupSummaryData class ? If so, can you give me a code snippet or point to the documentation to do so.


Hello again,
I met small problem with presentation layer. I can't figure out why DevExpress in some cases add label after choosing desired class and in some it does not. I've provided screenshot where you can see chosen R class and it's fields: T,L,S,R,L,W,Z,D. Below I've chosen C class (you can see field W) but there is no label added. It would be nice to add label every time but if it will turn to be too difficult unifying presentation layer (no label for every chosen label) will be enough. 

Hi,
I have Windows form application with  documentViewer control with standard bar. I change the language and  the main view language is  changed correctly, but the standard bar language is not changed.

Thank you in advance.

There are also pushed links to controllers which I couldn't remove. "I" controller can be seen below chosen "C" class. Is it possible to remove it?

Hi,
I have an issue with getting the  ShowCrosshair method to point at the right date in my Swiftplot diagrams. The way I initialize the crosshairs for all the charts is by clicking on a menu button that capture the current nearest seriespoint in the selected chart (as you can see on the parameter of the method).
 After that I loop through all the charts I try to show crosshairs for them at the same date as the selected chart (currentNearestPoint.Argument).
For the Y-axis I use detectAxisY (workaround because my charts have different y-axis ranges).
In the debugger I can see the right date values go through currentNearestPoint.Argument. But  in the running GUI the crosshairs is placed on the wrong date. As can be seen in the example picture.
Test method after I click the menu menu button:
Do you know what could be wrong?

Hello,
after upgrading from 17.2.4 to 17.2.5  the max-width of the dx-toolbar-label <div> is too small.
The title of dxPopup is displayed with ellipsis.
This happens with dx.light.compact.css style.
Configuration:
@(Html.DevExtreme().Popup()
                    .ID("ditta-popup")
                    .Width("90%")
                    .Height("90%")
                    .ShowTitle(true)
                    .Title("Ditta")
                    .Visible(false)
                    .DragEnabled(false)
                    .CloseOnOutsideClick(true)
)
Javascript:
var popup = $("#ditta-popup").dxPopup("instance");
            
popup.show();
The solutions I found is:
 $(".dx-toolbar-label").each(function (index, item) {
                $(item).css("max-width", "50%");
 }); 
Could you check that ?
Thank you.

Hello,
I have an issue using the Tab button. When i press the tab button the index doesn't change or follow the correct order.
I suspect it my be because of the group box. Could it be affecting it?
I'll be attaching a video illustrating the issue. On the first part i show the indexes and on the second part i try to change them with the tab button.
One the second part you can see where the issue appears  as it does not move with the proper order.
Regards,
Christos. 

Attached is a sample project demonstrating the issue.
1. Open the Customers ListView.

The "dc" variable is a null reference, while it should point to a DialogController instance.

Hello,
I've tested the solution from ticket T325576. 
unfortunately, this solution is not working, when using Display/Edit  Templates, as the ActiveEditor is still the original column editor. Is  there a way to get the templated editor in the event? Using the EditTemplate is necessary in our case, as the DataSource is an EntityInstantFeedbackSource and the GridControl would allow no editing at all.

Hi Guys,
we sometimes have the situation that at runtime an exception occours on listview with enabled server mode - in this situation, as you know, the grid Shows empty rows - thats it.  now the problem is that it is really hard to determine what the exact cause of the problem is - today i had to get the customers database to see that an DevExpress.Xpo.Exceptions.CannotLoadObjectsException (because of an not correctly configured sql replication.)
so can you suggest any way how this can be logged at runtime - currently there is no chance to find the problem because nothing is shown in the grid (error symbol / dialog or whatever)  and also nothing is logged to the logfile? also switching to client mode did not helped today (sometimes this way you get the error message).
thx

Hi Support,
I have implemented custom filtering based on an article I found in one of your tickets: 
The only problem is, in the filter editor it shows the ID of the item where it would be better for the end user to see the Name.
I have attached a screenshot also. 
Are you able to suggest how to get the filter to show the name instead of Id?
Thank you.

Hi,
I am using a vertical grid to show a single record in BandView. I have added some categories and have placed these above the editors required. I know how to assign the fields to the category using the Layout Editor but when I do this a vertical bar appears to the left and indents the fields. Can this be hidden? Currently I have just placed the categories above and it looks fine but they are not grouped. 
Thanks

We need to keep track and log to database when a user has printed or exported a report in our XAF apps.
This is the closest reference I could find: 
I combined this article's use of the __EVENTTARGET and __EVENTARGUMENT  with a controller that gets the ASPxWebDocumentViewer in this fashion (I'm assuming WebDocViewer will work for this trick as well):
 
I'm blocked, though, because Default.aspx's Page_Load never returns anything for eventtarget or eventargument. If I could get a hold of this information another way I could get the controller linked up with that info however I needed to.  Does that information get posted back anywhere else in the XAF app? 
Is this even the correct approach?
I've tried to bind to the Executed events on the actions of the  WebExportController and WebReportsController, but none of those ever seem to fire. I just need one reliable way to capture when a report is printed or exported, and then a way to disable all the others :)
I also tried this approach to see if I could customize the popup control somehow. Putting this code in either OnActivated or ControlsCreated doesn't capture the event:
 
Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

  In GridView No space should be at the end for the columns. If there are empty space after columns, the column should be auto adjusted, so I set ColumnAutoWidth as True on initiliaze.
I have used the below code to get it called from the view Load and gridview ColumnPositionChanged event.
    
  
  
  In gridview Context Menu Best Fit(all columns)  is not working ,in the below scenario
                   If the gridview with no scroll bar, added sufficient columns. Now by choosing Best Fit(all columns) not working. As the Horizontal                  scroll bar not enabling and columns not expanding.
                       public override void BestFitColumns()
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < gridview1.VisibleColumns.Count - 1; i++)

Hi! I'm trying to remove the ResetViewSettingsController completely in a specific View: I don't want to remove/hide just the Action, but the event handlers, specifically this one, which is attached on the Frame_ViewChanged handler:
?I've tried, in a specific ViewController for that view, to do this:
But it seems it is too late, and the events are not detached. How can I achieve this? Cheers!


I also see that dragging a field in dxFieldChooser on Edge, causes the default behavior of Edge, which it to navigate back.
So to me, it looks like you have a lot of problems all affected by your touch event handling.

I'm using the DevExpress (DXperience) 16.2.6 PivotGrid control. 
I've wired it up to the CustomCellDisplayText event so I can handle and replace NULL values (which by default display as blank in the PivotGrid) with 0 by using e.DisplayText in the handler.
In XAML I've also set the PivotGridField's CellTemplate property to a DataCellTemplate in my Window.Resources so I can control the text alignment.
But when I use this DataCellTemplate, my NULL values display as blanks in the PivotGrid again (instead of displaying 0, even though I'm setting e.DisplayText = "0" in the CustomCellDisplayText event handler.)
Question: How can I control the text-alignment of a PivotGridField in the DataArea, even when using the CustomCellDisplayText event to replace NULL values? (Or should I be replacing NULL values a different way?)

We have a field of type datetime in our pivot grid. We have added code to dynamically create new grouped field from that datetime field in group interval of 
, 
, and 
. We created a field with groupinterval of Year, added it to column area (as shown in screenshot 2.png), and saved the layout. 
Then we restored the layout and created another field with groupinterval of Month Year. As soon as we add the new field, the previously added field which was restored from layout malfunctions and no longer displays in format YYYY (as shown in screenshot 3.png). 
If we add the newly created field to column area and trigger BestFit, the control throws an exception saying "child generated no items" (below I have pasted the stacktrace output).
After adding new field, if we remove the Date (Year ) field from column area and add the newly created Date (Month Year) field, the header simply shows 
 instead of the actual dates.
To add new field to pivot grid, we do the following:
 -create the new pivotgridfield
-set the FieldName to the datetime column name

Hi,
For the DevExtreme datagrid,
Do you have any examples in angular for how to have different rows of the same column have different cell templates, triggered by some value in that row?
 

Good afternoon, 
I am developing my application using XAF. In my web application I created a custom view that uses an ASPxTreeView where I enabled the search panel but as is it only searches in the visible/expanded nodes. Is there a way to search in all the nodes (even the closed nodes)? 
Bellow is a snippet of my code to better understand my scenario:
Thanks, 
Pablo.

Hi,
In our application  a user has a list of available modules, depending on the rights of the user.
When a user closes the application while a module is open, the state is stored.
If the rights to a module are revoked , and the users starts the application the state is restored.
Since the user has no longer the right to a specific module, this module is not registred in MIF and the restore of the state throws an exception.
This because the self implemented ViewModelLocator returns null (after an exeption occures in the ResolveViewModelType).
What is the best way to intercep errors during the restore of the MIF state? The final exception now occures in the MainWindow InitializeComponents
 

We would like to implement true Lazy loading of groupped rows in a DataGrid:
1) In the first step , we would like to load the highest level of groups. At this moment, we do NOT know the total rows in the entire grid, we only know the total number of items on the highest hierarchy, like this:
+ Group 1
+ Group 2
+ Group 3
2) When the user expands let's say "Group 2" then we are able to load the level for Group 2. Again, we do NOT know the total number of rows under Group 2 at all nested levels. We only know the number of rows under Group 2, for example:
+ Group 1
-  Group 2
       + Group 2.1
       + Group 2.2
       + Group 2.3
       + Group 2.4
       + Group 2.5
+ Group 3
 And so on... The loading should really be "lazy", it means that the server is simply not able to construct the entire tree and calculate the number of total rows. However, the server is able to return one level at a time very effectively.
Is this possible with dxDataGrid + CustomSource? 

I have two projects using the PivotGrid control in WPF.
In project #1 the default Context Menu is popping up when you right click in the Row Header area. (Screenshot attached.)
This project is actually using 
 of DevExpress for WPF.
Project #1 PivotGrid XAML:
In project #2 no Context Menu displays when right clicking in the row area.
This project is using 
 of DevExpress for WPF.
Project #2 PivotGrid XAML:
Did something change in 
for how to access this Context Menu? (I'd like the user to be able to use the Show Field List menu option in project #2.)
  

Our customer wants a blue focus rectangle for all controls. This featrue should work in all browsers but especially in IE and Edge. Do you have a CSS rule for me that works in all DX controls?
Thanks! 
 

I am trying to use the CellContentPresenterTemplate. In version 17.2.5 it is not working, but in version 13.2.7 all is well. I attach the project for the first case


Thanks for the sample.  I'm currently playing around with the settings.
With the sample provided, how do I:
1.  Fix the displayed timeline to only show hourly scales between the selected date at the top (00:00 to 23:59 for the selected day).  I don't want to scroll horizontally. 
Thanks,
Brian


Thanks for the sample.  I'm currently playing around with the settings.
With the sample provided, how do I:
2.  How do I limit the ability to select only certain days.  I want to limit to current day and the next day.

Another thing (maybe you will create another topic, I don't know): 
I'm using the "moderno" theme but I don't like the watch because it has a blue border, it is possible to customize this color according to my base color (#225940)?


Thanks for the sample.  I'm currently playing around with the settings.
3.  You didn't address showing a timeline in xtra reports.  Can a simple 24hr timeline of current day be shown for multiple sets of rooms?  (Zone 1 group - show 2 room timelines, Zone 2 group - show 1 room timeline, zone x group.....)
Thanks,
Brian

Good day,
we've recently updated from version 17.1  to 17.2.3 and then 17.2.5. Starting in Version 17.2.3 the background of a DiagramContainer with the shape set to StandardContainer.Corners is no longer transparent. 
Is this an intended change and is there a way to set it to transparent again? Background sets the background of the corners and ContentBackground only sets the background of the header. 
If this is intended is there a way to set the DiagramContainer to always be in the background or set its ZIndex?
Have a nice week!

Hi, I have LookUpEdit with grid with huge datasource. It is impossible to load all data to grid, so grid is bound to ObservableCollection with only a fraction of data. I cannot use server mode because of its limitations.
I need to achieve this behavior:
1. User types in value directly into LookUpEdit
2. Grid opens and with some set post delay searches in database for first X records which satisfy "Contains" condition
Right now I am struggling to achieve this behavior. I tried to solve this problem with handler on this event:
 
where I just simply set 
that continues in Grid's OnFilterChanged event, where I am calling 
for ICollection property which is bound to LookUpEdit's ItemSource. In getter of this property I am loading data from database accordingly to user's condition.
That works fine, I got ItemSource's list filled with items, but when grid opens I cannot see any items. Everything is working only if I set filter directly in LookUpEdits grid's autofilterow. But I need to be able to filter by direct typing to LookUpEdit's field as well. 
My LookUpEdit xaml settings looks like this:

Hi, i'm having issues with a functionality i'd wish to implement.
I've got a master-detail gridview.
The detail view displays the exact same fields of the master view.
I'd like to implement a functionality allowing to filter from the header of the master view and allowing to check in the corresponding field of the detail rows, displaying:
The master rows fulfulling directly the filter criteria
OR
The master rows whose at least one detail view row fulfills the filter criteria.
I was thinking about using the FilterPopUpCheckedList and maybe manipulate it to add the detail values but i noticed on the documentation that adding items is not allowed.
Is there any other functionality allowing this? FilterRow maybe? What should be the appropriate events to handle to obtain that?
Thanks in advance! 

Hi!
I am generating Excel Spreadsheets with double values and would like to format a cell with white spaces and currency according to the following format
3333 -> 3 333 kr
150000,32 -> 150 000,32 kr
2132222,34 -> 2 132 222,34 kr
Am trying to using the NumberFormat like this
But it doesn't seem to work. Can you please advice.
Thx!

I have a <dx-number-box> set up with validators. The validation works properly. I have the format option set to "0". I can type negative values in the box, but when I try to remove the "-" it refuses to delete it. Example, type -1 in the box and then try to change it to 1.  I'm using format to force the value to be whole numbers; if there is a better way, I would like know.
<dx-number-box [(value)]="quantity" format="0" [width]="120">
    <dx-validator>
        <dxi-validation-rule type="required" message="Required"></dxi-validation-rule>
        <dxi-validation-rule type="range" message="Only 1 to 99999" [min]="1" [max]="99999"></dxi-validation-rule>
    </dx-validator>
</dx-number-box>

In my MVC Application I log in as one customer as the OLAP pivot grid works fine but when i log in as another customer it locks up and doesn't load. 
The work around for this is clearing the browser cache but I need something cleaner.
When I'm loading the pivot grid is there a clear cache or reset state command or reset command i can use use just after instantiating the grid that i can use to prevent this from happening.??

Hi,
I am having issues with showing % values with 2 decimal places on the axis labels.
The attached screen shot shows that the values are between 0 and 1 and when I apply the TextPattern  P2, the axis labels get multiplied by 100.
What is the possible solution to get to show the same values with 2 decimals and percent sign.
Thanks,

I've run into an issue with using the bootstrapgridview within an bootstrap-accordion (not the dx accordion).  
The gridview has the AdaptivityMode set to "HideDataCells" and AllowOnlyOneAdaptiveDetailExpanded to "true".  What I have observed is that when the gridview is on the orginial tab set to be open ("show") on page load, the gridview will scale accordingly.  But if the gridview is on a tab that is closed ("collapse"), when this tab is opened the gridview has not scaled to the appropriate viewport size.  This leaves the gridview scaling off the screen. Now, once the browser window is resized or a next page button is pressed it scales correctly.  See attached image. 

Hi,
regarding the order of validating a specific field if I have several validations for this field I have a problem.
 So I have a field where the user can fill in an image link. I require
a) that the field is not empty (-> "required") and
b) I have written my own validation code (which I implement as boolean check, the function returns a "true" or "false") that checks if the link really contains an image.
In the Model.DesignedDiffs.xaml -> Validation -> Rules the a)-rule is listed first (which makes sense because I want to check first if the field is empty and only if it's not empty check if it's really a link to an image) and the (self-written) boolean b)-rule second. So I expect that the rules are checked in this order.
I found 
 but why isn't it simply possible to work through the validation rules in the order listed there (which can be modified by the Index field)? Using 
 is not the solution I want because if the field is not filled, the resulting error message is wrong (I distinguish between "field not filled" and "field is filled but link is not an image"). And calling the all rules manual in a specific order as in the third example seems to be oversized. Also I would have to maintain the validation rules at two places.
Thanks in advance!

Good Morning,
What could you suggest for me to use in the DevExpress toolbox to be able to do the following? is there a built in object that can already do this?
1. Have 2 List A Source And A Destination List.
2. Have  Add A single item from Source List to Destination List,
3. Remove A Single Item from Destination List.
4. Check if Selected item in the Source List is Already Existing  in the Destination List

Dear DevExpress,
When we were testing on a digital whiteboard, we noticed that as a user, you can use multi-touch zoom when viewing charts in dashboards: when dragging two fingers away from each other ('spreading'), the graph is zoomed in, albeit that during the spreading no new data is loaded and that the existing pixels simply get bigger as you zoom in. After ending the zoom (lifting fingers from screen), data for the zoomed area is (re)loaded.
The speed of this operation is (in our case) very, very fast compared to zooming in several steps with the mouse wheel.
So our question is: is it possible to mimic the 'spread' zoom when using mouse & keyboard?
Thanks in advance.
Best regards,
Bob Dijck

I'm doing drag'n drop between two GridControl using the new drag'n drop event system of version 17.2. I'm trying to personalize the Action text of the hint during the drag'n drop operation. To do so I tried the method decribed in the ticket 
 using a custom GridControlLocalizer class. In this case it's used with the DragDropManager and I can't make it work with the new event system. Is there a way to personalize the Action text of hint on the event system ? The presentation of the hint is perfect for my need, except the Action text. If possible I don't want to write a complete template for the hint.

Hi,

Hi Support,
 I can't seem to find a way to provide a list of connections in code to the end user report designer when creating a new report (screen shot attached). I don't want the end user to fill in the connection wizard for every new report. 
I assume I need something like the following link but for WPF? 
Any help is appreciated.  
Thank you.

Is there a way I can make it fix all the selected rows when I right-click and click pin to top or pin to bottom with multiselect enabled? If there was an OnDataRowFixed event maybe I could do it myself.

Is it possible to set the .Color of a TcxPageControl at runtime without changing the skin itself? 
I have a form with more than one page control, and for just one of them I want all the other visual properties to remain the same, but the color of the control (the portion that the tabs all sit on) to change.

Question re: property grid and property definitions ...
I have an existing database system that uses a character for essentially a BOOLEAN field.  It is filled with either 'Y' or 'N' to represent true/false.  When it comes to using the PropertyGrid to edit a record in this database, it would be nice to utilize a checkbox editor instead of a text editor.  I have a value converter already written for this.  Is there any way I could force a checkbox editor for this field, and then use an IValueConvert with a propertydefinition to convert the True/False back to a Y/N? 

Is there a way to hide the group label.  So instead of Showing "State: NY" I just want to show "NY".

Hello,
My TreeList uses FilterMode="Extended"
and
TreeDerivationMode="HierarchicalDataTemplate"
I want to show children nodes of the parent when the parent matches 
criteria. 
 I need to be able to search among children and display them 
 their parent. 
A
B
-->C
-->D
E
-->F
So when I search for B I'd like to see:
B
-->C
-->D
and when searching for C:
B
-->C
To achieve that I've inspired myself  from 
However this won't work since some nodes have IsFiltered set to false even if the do not match specified search criteria.
In the attached example from the 
 there is a weird
function that takes hardcoded "Name" parameter, and anyway the provided T490089 does not suits me as it also displays nodes that do not match search criteria.
Why Node.IsFiltered set to false even when node does not correspond to search criteria? How can this be fixed?
Thank you.

I guess my binding option cause this, I have error on line MAIN, line 1 and line 2 whenever I change the value of dxselectbox in main form:
E1035 - The editor cannot be created because of an internal error: Cannot read property 'option' of undefined.
As you see the subclass value depends on class value, and class value depends on dept value in the popup form.
How can I fix it?
Thank you

) but if I set the ShowHeaderFilterButton to True, when I run the aplpication and navigate to my vie there is still no filter button. What could be the problem?
Bellow is the code from my ascx to better contextualize my issue:
Thanks,
Pablo.

When I execute 
 'this.inventoryItemsTableAdapter1.Fill(APPATSDataSet.InventoryItems, false, null, null);' 
I get an Exception thrown with the message
  "Failed to enable constraints. One or more rows contain values violating non-null, unique, or foreign-key constraints."
I don't have any constraints on the table at the DB level.
How can I track down where this error is coming from? 

I have a grid control with SelectionMode = Cell.
I want to know if the user has selected a bunch of cells or rows.  It will impact the behavior of the delete button.
When cells are selected, delete will clear the cell value.  When rows are selected, delete will remove the rows.
Please let me know how I can achieve this.
thanks
 

The following function generates an error when pasting text into an ASPxHtmlEdit (using ctrl-v, right click paste, or the ASPxHtmlEdit's own paste toolbar) when using IE 10 or 11.  Edge, Firefox, Chrome are all fine.  Build 17.2.4 did not have this issue.

Call me crazy, I own the extended experience and assign to my dev team. I saw diagram control and flipped out. I want to ask if my dev express controls will work with the free version of visual studio?
w?hat this crazy kids wants to do is build my own app by using VS and the diagram control with 0 code, lol. Can I do it?
I just love DEV EX for my windows applications. My Dev team could do this for me I assume, but, I am interested in just trying. 
S?o so whats your advice? Win forms, WPF, lol ?
b?est, Bill
p?s, ok to laugh at me. I am good at figuring shit out but I know I wont be a coder anytime soon. 

Hi Paulo,
Ive been looking through tickets with regard to the PDFViewer function "SavePagesAsImagesToDisk"
so that users can save their PDFs as images for use elsewhere in my application, which is mainly to 
load images into TcxImageCollection for viewing with the TdxImageSlider controls. 
Now, it is my understanding that this ONLY works with EMF's and BMP's, which "sometimes"
work reasonably, but in the main don't convert PDFs into the image formats provided correctly.
I have attached the failed PDF supplied by a customer that was loaded into PDFViewer, the method used
 and the resulting EMF it created, which you can try.
Can you suggest a method to create either JPG or PNG images from the "SavePagesAsImagesToDisk"
which 'may' help, or do you have any idea why these images are not being created correctly?
I suspect its something to do with vectors in the PDF graphics, but it would be good if it converted PDFs 
properly as it promises...
Thanks in advance for your help:)
Rgds Jeff D
p.s Ive also seen mention of the ComponentPrinter "PaintPage" function, but have no clue how this can save the image :)! 
Any examples would be really appreciated !

Hello,
I have a question. I want to customize the tab header that it looks like a tile. The text should be align in a central position.
I have found the option to inherit from the SkinTabPainter, but now I am stuck with it. I have overriden the  DrawHeader method, but my try with DrawString from this example: 
 does not lead to the wanted solution.
I have set the FontSize to a higher value than for each tabpage, but it looks like the setting of the tabpage overrides this setting again.
Could you give me a hint how I can reach my goal?
Best regards

I am trying to build a new project using the scaffolding wizard to create a tabbed MDI interface but the wizard is not detecting my entity framework context that is a referenced project.  I am attaching my solution.  I have taken the following steps.
1. Created a data project with EF code first.
2. Created a blank WPF project.
3. Added a reference for the data project to the WPF project.
4. Added a connection string to the app.config file for the WPF project that points to the database the EF project is configured for.
5. Clean and Rebuild Solution.
6. Right-click on the WPF project and select Add DevExpress Item - New Item.  Under the WPF Scaffolding Section, select Tabbed MDI View
7. Click the Run Wizard button.
In the Data Bound Tabbed MDI View, the list of existing DbContext is empty.  What am I missing?
Thanks,

Good morning
I am trying to get the last date displayed in the scheduler.
When in Day or workingWeek, I've managed to to so with:  
        var largo = s.GetVisibleIntervals().length;
        var end = s.GetVisibleIntervals()[largo - 1].start;
However,  in Week or Month view, this does not work.
How can I find out the last date displayed in the month or week views of the calendar?

Hi,
DxTagBox is not working as expected when using datasource and hideSelectedItems options.
In this demo: 
, if we set the hideSelectedItems to true:
And in onValueChanged(e), e.component._selectedItems always returns the last selected item instead of the whole selected items. If you remove hideSelectedItems options, it contains the correct array os selected items.
 Please advise on how to proceed or get the actual correct number of selected items, using the hideSelectedItems option.
Thank you.
 

Hi,
Is it possible to filter a gridview column by the display text (cell) with an EntityServerModeDataSource ?
My table Customer contains the column DateCreated which is in UTC. In my application, DateCreated is displayed in local datetime.
Thank you.

I'm about to release an  application based on the WPF scheduler, the application will run on a  Windows 2016 server in remote desktop mode; do you have a recommended configuration for the hardware? Is the dedicated video card required? 
Thanks,
a.d. 

This report applies to the situation where a ASPxCardView contains a CardViewDropDownColumn, 
If you place the card in edit mode, drop down the DropDownEdit control, and then click anywhere in the drop down window (e.g. to select something), the drop down window closes immediately.  
It appears that the drop down control is not tagging the click event as handled, and it is being propagated up to the Card control and is triggering the BatchEditEndEditing event.
In the example below, I have attached an Alert to the BatctEditEndEditing event on the Card View.   When you click in the dropped-down window, the Alert box appears.
 

Hello,
The column filter is not working fine when unbound columns are used with gridcomboboxcolumn.  It's filtering by the expression value instead of by the display value. Moreover the column filter list is not ordered by the DisplayText.
Try the attached sample and open the column filter of the column "Category".
Thanks,

Hello, 
In 
 its is stated that: 
"Both MouseDown and DoubleClick events are not raised in response to a double-click in the row indicator area because they are suppressed by the GridListEditor that raised the ProcessSelectedItem event processed by ListViewProcessCurrentObjectController."
I have a situation in a XAF project which is under the following criteria: 
- The View is a ListView
- The View is not editable
- On single click, I want to do an action. 
- On double click, I want the regular ProcessCurrentObject behavior but without doing the above action. 
I followed 
 with the MouseDown event, but the second click is not recorded, since the ProcessCurrentObject method is called, therefore I only get the SingleClick action. 
Is there another way I can achieve the above? 
Thanks in advance. 

Dear support,
After installation of registered  WPF components using the installer I noticed that no controls are showing up in the tool box. I can however edit a xaml and add code to reference and use any of the components. After having done that, they show up in the  designer and I can configure them using the property editor.
I also noticed that the main menu  "DevExpress" is empty except for one entry named "Receive update notifications".
I removed, reinistalled and repaired  the installation but the problem persists.
When starting in the company I installed a trial version of the components as I did not have a license then.  
Any clues? 
Kind regards

Hello,
I am using EntityInstantFeedbackSource to load a grid view.  In the GridView_Focuse dRowChanged event, I am trying to take the focused row from the grid view, and bind controls on a form to that row.
On the line which invokes GetRow, I get an exception "Unable to cast object of type DevExpress.Data.Async.Helpers.ReadonlyThreadSafeProxyForObjectFromAnotherThread  to type FlexModel.CITYCOD'.  How can I resolve this to get the object which the grid row represents, locate the same record in another EF context and bind the form?  I believe all these steps are necessary to work with the readonly EntityInstantFeedbackSource, but if there is a better way I am open to that as well.
Thanks!

Hi
I created a DevExtreme 17.2 project using the template for ASP.Net Core 2. I couldn't update the Bower packages.
My concern is: the template uses BOWER to manage some packages and VS2017 dropped BOWER and it will be no longer supported.
I have on development an ASP.Net Core 2 MVC project that uses DevExtreme 17.2.5 with Bower. How can I drop Bower from my actual project and use NPM (recommended by Microsoft)?
Regards 

Our application has a lot of LookUpEdits to search in objects that have a Code and a Description property. Most of our users know most of the codes, but if not, the ability to search in both Code and Description is very useful.
If the user knows the code, types this exact code in the search field, the focused row in the grid is the top row, which is not always the one with that exact code. Pressing TAB or enter key in that case leads to the wrong item being selected.
What the user would like to happen, in the attached example project, is when the user types in '9':
* All items that have '9' in either code or description are shown (same as it is now)
* The row with the item with Code '9' and Description '121 - 150 degrees' has focus, so that when the user presses the tab or enter key, the item with Code '9' is selected.
Is this possible?

Hello,
I am creating a chart with the daily sales evolution of a product category, and you are asking me to submit a full year.
There are two problems (see the image in the attachment):
1. as to the density of vertical lines
2. Stacking the labels at the bottom of the graph.
My question is, how can I make so that even by displaying the 365 values of the year, both the rows and the labels are displayed only one for each month?
Thanks.

Following the Modal Popup Window Demo ( 
 ), I laid out the form similarly to what is demonstrated in the aspx file and need some additional clarification...
 What function can be used on the ASPxPopupControl to Find a control that exists in the <dx:LayoutItemNestedControlContainer>? (Currently using DevExpress 17.1.6).
I can probably work my way down the whole control chain to find the proper controls, but the FindControl function of ASPxPopupControl does not return the proper results (it is null) trying to reference a txtName field. 

when i use the following code 
 rptDetailed.ExportToPdf(filePath)   
with and without specifying pdfOptions the font gets bold and smudgy as well as if i use pdfOptions and compress and set imageQuality the image gets very blurry, when i turn that off the image is fine, but always the font text gets bold and smudgy.    But when i look at the report in report preview it looks perfect and if i use the microsoft pdf writer it comes out just like the preview. 

Hello,
I have a Pivot grid inside a dashboard and I am trying to disable the option "Show Totals"  from one of the items in the values section. Removing the option doesn't seem to make any changes and the total remains in the grid. 
Could you give some guidance ?
Image file attached. 

As my screenshots show, this doesn't make sense. I have a persistent repository item with several repository controls. A few of them are LookupEdit controls. I use them in grids in 2 forms. In one form, I do NOT want the user to be able to CTRL+DEL to make them null. In the other form, I DO want them to be able to do that. So I added code to the Load event of each form.
In the form where I do NOT want them to set the values to NULL I have this code:
In the other form I have this code: 
In both cases, even the "false" code, it actually enables null input. If I comment out the code above, it uses the property setting in the repository itme (false) and does not allow null input. But again, even the FALSE lines of code above, change it to allow nulls. What's up?

Currently, my grid has a column with a combobox with a Yes/No option. I want to change the comboBox to have a Yes Checkbox and a No Checkbox in the same cell. Is there a demo I can view that displays this sort of functionality?
I need something similar to Picture12. Is there a simple way to do this with DevExpress GridView?

I have some elements inside of the dxList itemTemplate that I don't want to trigger a selection such as a context menu activator for mobile.
My current implementation involves getting the current selected items and then resetting the selected items based off the item that was added/removed.
This would be solved if there were some form of e.cancel for onSelectionChanged.
Is there a more elegant solution available that I'm missing now?
Thanks.
 

Hello,
I have some forms in my page, I don't know why when I need to modify a dxform in somewhere else, I have the error,
for example, I am calling:
$scope.midformInstance.itemOption("typename", 'disabled', true); 
in a function, but I have this error:
dx.all.js:9 E1035 - The editor cannot be created because of an internal error: Cannot read property 'option' of undefined.
How can I fix this?
The item is a dxselectbox, and already have a value, and by this $scope.midformInstance.itemOption("typename", 'disabled', true),
in my function, I want to make the dxselectbox disable in order to not being able to change the value of that.
Here is how it is implemented in form:
$scope.middleform = {
        bindingOptions: {
            'items[4].editorOptions.dataSource': 'midtype'
        },
... ,
{
                dataField: "typename",
                editorType: "dxSelectBox",
                label: {
                    showColon: false,
                    text: "Type"
                },
                validationRules: [{
                        type: "required",
                       message: "is required" 
                    }],
                editorOptions: {
                    dataSource: $scope.midtype,
                    showClearButton: true,
                    valueExpr: "id",
                    displayExpr: "name",
                    displayValue: "typedisplay",
                    onSelectionChanged: function (e) {...}
...,
 onInitialized: function (e) {
            $scope.midformInstance = e.component;
        }
    };
which item[4] is the "typename" field.
Thank you

The documentation says AutoSize is a property of columns in the Grid Control. But I can't find it anywhere in the wizard or "designer". Where is it, and how do I assign it to a particular column?

Hi Guys,

When using the Visual Studio 2013 Blue skin, the down arrow sort icon is incorrectly represented by a second filter icon.
The down arrow sort icon is shown correctly when using a different skin.
Please note that this appears to affect other skins too, such as Visual Studio 2013 Light. I'm not going to check them all, but you should.
See attached video. 

My smart tags are missing on all controls in the wpf designer. I see there is an option to turn them off and on (which I have tried to no avail). Anything else I can do? As far as I can tell nothing changed to make them go away.

I have a TTreeView control and I need to print the expanded version of it. I would like to click a button or menu item and be able to view the expanded tree and then print.
What is the best way to handle this?

We upgraded to 17.1 from 12.2 a few months ago and noticed a changed to the way dragging works in the Tile control.  If I have multiple checked tiles in one group and drag one of them to another group it now drags all checked tiles showing the number of tiles that are being dragged.  Previously it would only drag the tile I clicked on to drag.
Is there anyway to switch off the "grouped" drag behaviour and restore the previous behaviour? 
If it means changing your source c ode to achieve this can you let me know what unit/class/method I need to change.
Thanks,
Craig 

I am applying conditional formatting to the rows in the dropdown list in this event:
MyRepositoryItemGridLookUpEdit.
 But if the user types a few letters 
 dropping the list down, a subset of the full list appears, which lacks the conditional formatting. What is the proper event to apply the conditional formatting in that situation?
Thanks 

Hi,
I am wondering if you know of a way for me to create small preview images of XtraReports that can be displayed within a GalleryControl?  I would like to present a gallery of Report Preview icons to help my users determine which reports to print.  Ideally this would be "live" and reflect any recent updates to report templates.   Maybe it's possible to print every report with sample data and quickly export the report to an image that can then be added to my gallery.
Please let me know if you are aware of a solution.
Thanks,
Joel 

We are trying to use a style to set the background color of a group and total summary item. Using the following XAML ALMOST works
and 
Unfortunately it only changes the background of the text as per the attached image (highlighted in orange). Is it possible to change the background of the text's container as highlighted in green? We also attempted to override the TableView.TotalSummaryItemTemplate, but weren't able to use the required conditional logic in the DataTrigger Binding.
 

I have a seenario where we are creating an Accordion Control, adding Elements and each element has an AccordionContentContainer.  In this container is a user control that has a grid in it.  We would like to see if there is a way to implement mouse dragging to expand the height of the AccordionContentContainer.  Currently we have an option where the user chooses how many rows they want to see and we calculate the height and set programmatically.  Our users would prefer to use the mouse.  Is this possible?

Hi 
In the attached project which is really no more than a simple preparatory test prior to my building a wizard there is a comboboxedit which is populated from a linq query.  On selection of an item from that combo box another linq query is run which produces a result of type IOrderedEnumerable,XElement>.
How do I get that into the grid as its Items source.  A simple assignment seems not to do the trick.
Many thanks
Dom

I am trying to replicate your demo template into my project but I could not get the side menu look like yours.  
Can you help me please??

HI,
On your Spreed Sheet Formula Bar
When i use your Sum it does not work. It just puts a 0 for total
for example; =SUM(C2:C8) would result in 0
even  when all the cells are format to number and each of the cells have a value of 5
Does it matter that all these numbers where added from a mysql data base to the spreadsheet control 

Hi Uriah,
I'm aware of that option but it hides PersistentAlias properties which do work with the DashboardViewDataSourceFillService so it is of no use to us.  If that option would include these properties it would be a good solution.

Hello,
I'm trying to upgrade my MVC project using DevExtreme from 17.1.4 to 17.2.5. When I do this upgrade, my dxLookup boxes don't work in iOS any longer. Tapping on an item in the list doesn't select that item. When I downgrade back to 17.1.4, the dxLookup works again as expected.

Hi guys
I had a new issue related to aspxdockpanels. 
When I create the DockPanels directly into the aspx code, Aspxdockmanager's GetPanelByUID method finds the Dockpanel. 
If I create it in realtime, I mean, in codebehind, with exatcly the same parameters, so this method mentioned above doesnt ! Why?
I created the attached sample project based on this demo:  
Explanation:
There're 2 dockpanels inside aspx code (lines 102 to 116) . It's commented. So, I create these 2 dockpanels in codebehind. In JS, I cant find the panel, so, state cookies doesnt save aniyhing. too. 
If I do the inverse, it means, I "uncomment" the DocksPanels in aspx code, and I comment all the lines in codebehind, so it works fine! JS and cookies! Normally. 
How to fix it?
 

Hi,
I have installed vs2017 and devexpress 17.1.6 since September 2017 
I was working normally, with some exceptions when the above message obliged me to redesign my projects.
Since a month I installed 17.2.4 having both devexpress versions, but I worked with the old version.
Since 3 days it is impossible for me to build any project, even these projects that I have already finished, build and deployed, with the message as below.
I remove the file licence.licx but the message is still there.
I am attaching a very simple project (a test one) which is already deployed, on my sharepoint server.
Can you please advice ?
Do I have to downgrade to vs2015 ?

One day I will be found dead at my desk and the cause will be excessive head bashing into wall while dealing with these ComboBoxEdit controls... 
I have window with a simple comboboxedit using a simple datasource from my SQL database. 
 The comboboxedit works great. I can see all the values just fine. The problem is... I load this page from a grid - mouse doubleclick. I want to pull the data from the GRID into the window so the user can see the values and decide whether to edit the values or not. 
Inside GetTherapyEditor
The reader returns the text value EXACTLY like the comboboxedit shows in the drop down. How do I get the text returned from SQL to show in the 
ComboBoxEdit list - like in the attachment. 
 

Hi, Team:
I would like to draw thicker lines for GridBand borders. I searched over the web and found this page has a couple of approaches:
The problem for me is the approaches are not  using light weight edit. They either set "UseLightweightTemplates="None" or use "InplaceBaseEdit". If I use this kind of edit, "FormatCondition" would not work.
Could you please show me how to draw thicker lines for band borders while my format conditions still work?
Thanks a lot in advance.

Hi,
Is it possible to set the row height to 2/3/4 lines during runtime, depending on how long a field value is? 
For example, I might have a longer field value, which I would like to be wrapped on two lines, but the next record will have a shorter field value, which should use one line only? 
I have attached a snapshot for illustration, where the "Concerns" field might have shorter/longer values.
Thanks!

I have a WPF GridControl, most of the time, the row in this GridControl represents one record. But sometime, two rows are associated with one record. Is there a way to do that?
Thank you. 

Hi,
I am using a TreeListControl in my application and one of its main feature is to receive and display real time data. We chose this component because we need to display a hierarchical view and we like the sorting, grouping etc... We have around 200 columns.
We have around 10 columns in realtime and I noticed that every time one of these columns changed (ie we call NotifyPropertyChanged event), our grid freezes/hangs for a few second. After deep investigation, I spotted the issue, it is coming from a full refresh of the entire row:







that calls RefreshRow (through DoRefreshRow):













I created 4 classes to override some native DevExpress behaviors:










Unfortunately in Devexpress 17.1.4, I did not find a way to get what I wanted since almost all the methods are declared as protected internal.
My questions:
1/ Is it worth it to switch to a GridControl (way more optimized than TreeListControl?) in master-details to keep the hierarchical view but have better performances?
2/ What can we do to update only ONE cell by row, and not the entire row every time a field changes? It seems like a something very basic.
Please give us a quick solution that requires no dev from you.
(one solution with dev would be to be able to call UpdateData(ColumnBase column, int listSourceRowIndex) in RefreshRow)
Thank you for your help.

Hi, 
I have another query, when I do the loading of the elements to the cube you should always define where each one goes (DataRow, FilterRow, ColumnRow and FilterRow) but I am realizing that when I fill the fields from a file and I do not define it type of element, the component although it has its DataSource but does not have its elements as I can fill an ASPxPivotField without referring to where it is going ??  
Thanks for your support 

I upgraded to 17.2.5 from 17.1.5 and the File System Store Object Demo (Ref# E965) that was working perfectly no longer works.
See attachment screen-shot. Just as soon as I select the file an error window pops up asking me if I want to leave or stay on the page. It appears as though the file is being saved in the database, but the Copy Stream is failing due to the error. The files are copied to the File Data folder, but  have zero bytes.
I would really appreciate any help to get this fixed immediately.
Thanks.
The two classes and the screen-shot are attached. 

Hi,
inital item in SelectBox is not visible, when value is provided by MVC (.Value("20306"). From the developer console I see the returned JSON data.
If I add local .OnInitialized("function (e) { e.component.option('value', 20306) }") 
then the item is visible. 
For example, I will have a EditForm (dxPopup dialog with dynamic form loading from the server) with a lot of  SelectBox widgets. The model
for this EditForm has all the data that is needed to bind initial data. In the current situtation, there will be server request for each widget on the form,
who has initial data..... Each widget has more than 5000 records in the database, so MVC API call is required, there is no way for static array data. 
I was playing with the idea to generate some static data on the server side and still keeping MVC call when typing in SelectBox, but of course there is no option to set selectedItem (readonly)..., e.component.option('value', 20306) makes server request.
So what do you think, will that be possible in the future? See bellow.
Best regards, 
Uros
 

Is there a validation summary control for the DevEx ASP.NET Bootstrap controls similar to the Validation Summary control for the regular ASP.NET DevEx controls (ASPxValidationSummary)?  I can see that a validation group can be specified in the validation settings for the Bootstrap controls.  If there is not a Bootstrap Validation Summary control, can you please explain the recommended approach to displaying validation summary information on a responsive asp.net page?   Please include a working code sample.

Hi,
In my application I am using  RichEditControl to open and edit rtf files. I added BarManager. In that BarManager one of the Category is Home | Paragraphs. 
The issue is when I save the file which has a bullet list, the first bullet symbol is bigger than others. These rtf files are used to create a reports. When I open this files in my application or with MS Word it is OK, but when I open them with WordPad the first bullet symbols is bigger. And of course in reports the first symbol is bigger as well.  
For saving I am using RichEdit.SaveDocument(filename, TdxRichEditDocumentFormat.Rtf)  if it's new file, and RichEdit.SaveDocument if the file is loaded. 

I have a windows service that runs two separate threads. Each thread is periodically polling the database for new records that represent a request for processing that needs to be performed. The records are of different types as is the corresponding processing that will be performed. At service startup, I configure a ThreadSafeDataLayer. My questions are:
1) It is my understanding that by default, the ThreadSafeDataLayer shares a single database connection between the various threads that may need it at any given time and this can be a source of contention as a result. Is that right?
2) Assuming my understanding is correct in 1), then to combat this contention I should use the GetConnectionPoolString method to establish a connection pool for use by the ThreadSafeDataLayer. Is that right?
3) Assuming my understanding is correct thusfar, since I can only ever have two threads doing work simultaneously in this particular instance, am I correct in thinking that the pool size should be set to 2?  
Are there any other considerations I need to be aware of here?
Thanks

I am doing a batch editing in Gridview. I did it several time in my project, but this time, the gridview is included within a splitter + callbackpanel.
I am getting the following error: Must declare the scalar variable "@ContactName". Shoudn't the 'parameter to grid column' binding be done automatic?
Please see below an excerpt of my code:

Hi, 
I'm seeing in the documentation on the Web Forms as far as the ASPxPivotGrid control is concerned and I find that there are only two ways to provide data to this control and that is by Linq and by Entity Framework; in the personal case I develop a query to the database of where I want to obtain the data for this control and define in a table to which specific area they belong, this works well when the page where the control is just loaded is first loaded, but when it makes a postback although the data is there but the fields are not defined.  
I need you to help me how to provide the correct data for this control (I attach the code below). thanks for your help

Hi,

Hi,
We have a basic DevExpress GridControl and use the default column chooser functionality however the order of the columns is in ordinality in the column chooser list. We'd like to change to alphabetical. Is there a concise way of doing this? The other samples I have seen for customising the Column Chooser seem a bit overkill for this.
Thanks,
Marcel

Hello!
I have an application with many grid controls and I would like to leverage a resource dictionary so that I only have to define items once.
I've been able to bind the ColumnsSource  to an array of grid columns, which is great.
I'm not able to achieve the same thing for the row-level context menu items.
 Here is my XAML code for one of the grids:
How do I reference barbuttonitems in a resource dictionary from XAML?

Hello,
I am using custom controls in my XAF project and the updated version for E911 with the IComplexControl interface is working perfectly however, currently I want to implement Custom Win/Web Form (not just as embedded Win/Web User Control).
In the old E911 this was possible thanks to WebCustomFormPathNavigationItem (WebShowCustomFormWindowController). How can achieve the same result - invoking of Custom Win/Web form which is session aware from menu item with the new method.
Thank you,

Hi
I believe that there is an error in 
in that the timer should be the first object destroyed.  
The current code is:
destructor TdxSpellCheckerCheckAsYouTypeMode.Destroy;
begin
  FreeAndNil(FCheckThread);
  FreeAndNil(FCorrectWords);
  
  FreeAndNil(FMisspelledWords);
  FreeAndNil(FViewInfo);
  DeallocateHWnd(FSyncHelper);
  DeleteCriticalSection(FCurrentWordInfoLock);
  DeleteCriticalSection(FLock);
  inherited Destroy;
end;
In a very specific scenario it is possible that the timer can fire after 
but before it is freed itself.  This leads to an AV in procedure TdxSpellCheckerCheckAsYouTypeMode.StartSpellingThread as FCheckThread is now nil.
I've managed to reproduce in a test app, but I think the timing may be critical so it may be difficult to reproduce if your PC is faster/slower than mine.  Anyway, to test, please create a new project, delete Unit1 and replace with the units attached, set TForm1 as the mainform and then run.
If you wait a second or two and then press the button, you should see an AV.
If I change the order in the destructor, to free FDelayTimer first, then the AV goes away.
Kind regards

Hello there,
In my app I have the following situation;
On a view I have a grid bound to a collection of viewmodels (as opposed to a bunch of model objects).
From that view I want to open the selected viewmodel in a new tab in my docmanager. Which I can do as per the below code;
Now, in the code above, the SelectedVM is passed as a parameter to my viewmodel and that is all good and working but my query is, how does one actualy set the datacontext of the view from the viewmodel?
One could write this question another way as "How do I set the datacontext of the view from a passed in parameter?"
Does this situation possibly smack of bad design? Do people often bind gridviews to collections of viewmodels?
Thank you kindly for any thoughts
John
 

Is there a way within a Gridview to display the total of the LOS and LOSOpen grouped by the Facility Type and a total for all the LOS and LOSOpen?

Hello!
The  dimensions of the child components on the TcxPageControl tabs do not  change correctly if the children have the property  "Constraints.MinWidth" or "Constraints.MinHeight". For example, cxPageControl has 2 tabs. The  first tab contains the "Panel1" component with MinWidth = 500, and on  the second tab there is "Panel2" with MinWidth = 200. Both panels have  the Align = alClient property. After starting the program, being on the first tab, we can not make the form size less than 500 px. By moving to the second tab, the width of the window can be reduced to 200 px. But in the process of reducing the width of the panel it exits to the left. In the attached archive I provided a sample project for reproducing the problem and screenshots. It should be noted that there is no such problem in the standard TPageControl. 

Hello
I am using the Dashboard - and have setup a Card item with drill down enabled (by Year, Quarter, Month, Day, DrugName).  
I have a small video capture attached showing the issue.  If I choose to drill down on the year for some years - it works perfectly.  But if I drill down on some others it does not allow me to drill down in to the Quarter.  
In the video I have selected the year 2014 - and it shows that it has 3730 prescriptions for that year.  Then it opens the Quarter view - and I try to click on any of the Quarters - and it does nothing (yet as I noted above - for some other years it seems to work perfectly).  
NOW - note the highlighting of the Q4 does not work until I move to the top of Q2 - at which time I see that Q4 is now highlighted.  I then click on Q2 - and it opens up Oct, Nov, Dec - which is Q4 breakdown...  
This seems to happen every time :)  
Is this a known bug?  Or just some setting I have wrong?  But then why would it work for some drill downs and not others ??
Thoughts as to what might be happening?

Good day,
I'm trying to bind genders DevExpress.data.ArrayStore (data for it taken from web api controller) into my dxRadioGroup, which inside dxForm, but in form I don't see anything.

Hi Support,
I want to be able to get the selected items in ComboboxEdit.  How would I accomplish this in MVVM. 
XAML
C#
I want to execute "SelectedPortfolio" event and past the selected items to list.  Also how can I execute when user clicks on popup menu button.  Could not find anything on the tickets to show me example.  Please advise. Thanks?


Turns out it was a mistake on my side. The form with the grid was not freed and got some windows message in the FinallizeUnits procedure that caused the access violation error. It is strange that this error did not occur before I updated from 15.1.4.
I have found another minor issue though tracking this down.
Please run the sample in attachment and move the scroll bar slowly. Notice the scroll thumb changes size.
This only happens if some but not all groups are expanded.

Good day!
XAF enables to use EF ORM out-of-box.  In the same time I can use criteria syntax in application model. So somehow you can translate criteria syntax into IQueryable that EF can use afterwards.
Right now I need to find way to integrate XAF model with its criteria into application server that uses Linq2DB as ORM. Can you guide me into right direction? How can I integrate criteria syntax into Linq2DB?

Hello,
I have a question regarding the LayoutView in a grid.
Is there a way to modify the background color of the area between the cards?
We have to set the background to transparent so that the background of the form is shown. We tried to set the Appearance. ViewBackground.BackColor but this has no effect.
We are using the Black-Skin in our application.
Perhaps there is a possibility in code that I'm missing?
Attached you can find a picture. The area I mean is marked.

Hello,
I would like to change background and font color when some text is introduced in some column filter on my DataGrid. My Grid can load custom filters so I want to be able to realize when the grid is filtering data since the beginning. 
For instance, imagine that I load my web page and I have my grid with 3 columns (Name, Age, City) and at 'Name' column filter there's a 'W' and at 'City' column filter there is a 'C'. In that case, filter cells Name and City should have a different style (only the filter cell). After that, If I clear filters, the style have to change to normal style. Can we change one style for filters when there is text and other one when there isn't or I clear them?
Thank you.

Hi,

Unfortunately when I right click on the solution to add DevExpress Extreme the option is not available. I have also tried to add this through the NuGet Package Manager but still no luck in adding DevExpress to my project. I have downloaded the version 13.1.12 from the download page within DevExpress as this is the version the programmer I previously employed was running the project on.
Would you please be able to provide me advice/assistance on how I can add DevExpress Extreme onto my project to be able to use the full functionality within my project.

Hi, 
It seems the option to add DevExpress Items to a project has been disabled from my context menu since I installed version 17.2.5. I used that option frequently when I was working in version 17.1, but now I'm going to recreate Scheluder reports version 17.2.5 using 
 but I find out that I cannot add new DevExpress items to my project because the option is disabled.
I'm sending you a screenshot.

Since Version 17.2 I get an AV on closing my Application (see attached screenshots).
This only happens in my biggest Project.
In other or new Projects it does' nt happen.
This is why it's impossible to make a sample application.
At the Moment I go back to Version 17.1.

Hello,
I haven't used Theme Upgrade earlier and got a strange problem.
I have a custom theme based on Office2016BlackSE, I've modified TrackbarEdit in :
MyTheme\.td\Sources\Core\Core\Editors\Themes\Office2016BlackSE\TrackBarEdit\TrackBarEditControl.xaml
MyTheme\.td\Sources\Core\Core\Editors\Themes\Office2016BlackSE\TrackBarEdit\ThumbHorizontal.xaml
After upgrading from 17.2.4 to 17.2.5 I see that my edits are gone. Theme committed so I can see that Height is back to 3 and my Thumb customization is gone.
My colors for buttons/etc are still here.
Am I editing the wrong files?
Q2: Whats the difference between files in Publish and .td\Sources\Bin folders?
Right now, I am using the Publish button like the manual says and reference is added to the .dll in the .td\Publish folder.
I've noticed that VS can compile theme solution if I add it to the project without converting it with the Theme Designer.

Hi Guys,
I believe that I've raised this issue with you before, with no real solutions or answers in error logs.
Recently my project has been suffering a major issue with it's resource file, every time I closed the project and opened again, none of my form designers would open and reported that my images could not be found, however the project would compile and the images would all be there and working fine, very baffling!
Eventually I discovered that if I excluded the resource file from the project, deleted the designer file and included the resource file back into the project (forcing it to rebuild the designer file), I could once again open  my forms and reports without errors or VS crashing. This would work for awhile, but after a few hours, the issue would return and I would need to repeat the process.
10 days ago I decided that enough was enough and determined to find the underlining issue, and I believe I found it. When I save SVG files from the builder and export them as PNG, I get the file name: CheckDBConnection-32x32 .png, this file name contains a '-' and I believe it's this naming convention that has bought about my issue.
I went through my resources file (after I rebuilt it again) and renamed all the files containing a '-' to exclude it, so CheckDBConnection-32x32 .png becomes CheckDBConnection32x32.png. Ever since I've done this, I've not had a single problem and everything is working as it should. VS is no longer crashing and I can open form designers without issue and without the need to execute my workaround.
I thought I would pass this information on so you can investigate my theory and maybe help others.
Regards,
Richard 

We are facing an issue where the chart legend disappears when we have a grouped field (GroupInterval set by datetime) on the X axis. 
We have 3 fields in the chart- Cost, Date (groupedfield), and Item. If we set the Cost to be Y-axis, Item to be X-axis and Date(groupfield) to be legend then it works. But if we set Item to be legend and Date(groupfield) to be X-axis, then the legend is not displayed. 

Hi DevExpress,
how can I customize text of the grouped column? I tried to handle CustomizeCellDisplayText event, which works fine for normal cells. But is never fired for grouped column (is this on purpose or is it a bug?).
What I'm trying to achieve: I want to group rows by article id, but show article description in grouped row instead of id. I know that I could bind grouped column to ArticleDescription property instead of ArticleId and it would work. The problem is that 2 articles might have the same description. Therefore I need to group by unique id.
Kind regards

Hi,
new surprise this morning, I was editing the xafml and when I saved it I had this warning telling me that there are unused nodes.
I checked it and noticed that an entire object and its view have disappeared.
All my business objects are in one library, except 2 of them which are in the Module project, under the folder BusinessObjects .
Those 2 are not detected/referenced anymore neither in the xafml , neither in the Module.cs !
If I leave it like this and run the application, then the related pages are not working anymore.
If I put back the removed xaml in place, it works again.
What can I do about this?  Please help, it's urgent

Dear support.
I want to allow my users to create their reports freely with every XP Object we have written.
In order to do that I've added the XPCollection and the Session component to the ToolBox of the Report Designer.
Most of the code comes from this KB entry 
But I have some issues with this project.
1. If I use the "New Report" button in order to create an empty report, add an XPCollection, choose an ObjectClassInfo and save the report, the XPCollection will not be serialized into the .repx file.
If instead a new report is created in the Form1_Load() event and I do the same steps as above, the XPCollection will be serialized without a problem.
Why is this happening?
2. I must not change the session property of the XPCollection after it is added to the report. Though the property seems to be empty. If I change this property to (default) or session1, I'm unable to select an ObjectClassInfo anymore.
Instead I get an error: System.NullReferenceException
I want to avoid that the user gets confused here.
Either it should work the way it does in VS. -> Add session, Add XPCollection, choose session that was created, choose ObjectClassInfo.
Or this property should be disabled at all, so user can't mess with it.
3. Is it possible to localize the properties of the XPCollection and the Session?
I can't seem to find the properties in the Localization Service.
Thanks in advance.

Hello,
I cannot get the custom errors when I save a report layout at the test server. I'm always getting the following error:
0|/*DX*/({error: {message: "Callback request failed due to an internal server error."}, result: "save", id: 0})
error:{message: "Callback request failed due to an internal server error."}
message:"Callback request failed due to an internal server error."
id:0
result:"save"
Meanwhile, using my local machine it works perfectly and I can see the custom layout errors, for example:
0|/*DX*/({error: {,}, result: "save", id: 0})
error:{,}
message:"[&quot;O campo \&quot;1&#170; Linha IVA - Incid&#234;ncia\&quot; &#233; obrigat&#243;rio e n&#227;o se encontra presente no relat&#243;rio&quot;]"
id:0
result:"save"
This is how I am returning the errors in the .ASPX:
 
Any ideas what might be the problem ?
Thank you,

Hi there again,
thanks for your great support in this case.
The next question we have is how to get or set  the size and position of the ColumnChooser-Dialog?
So is there a way to get/set the size and position of this window or is there a way to overwrite the whole template?

Good morning,
I'm having some issues displaying iOS icon in mobile devices.
I'm using Cordova  v. 4.5.4 and Phonegap cli-8.0.0, update the template and the solution and the version of DevExtreme using your hotfix,  as your instruction in this ticket 
, but I'm still not seeing the application icon on iOS (11.2).
Do you have any suggestion? The problem is not completely resolved?
Thank you,

Hello,
I have GridView that contains group summaries. This grid is supposed to be exportable to Excel file. I'm doing this using GridControl's ExportToXlsx method nad exporting itself works fine. It looks good when ExportType is set to WYSIWYG, but I need DataAware mode, as the file must be useful Excel sheet. In this mode though I see weird issue - group summaries rows are doubled. I provide screenshot illustrating this issue, on which I marked group headers and summaries in corresponding colors (red/green rectangles).
There is also one issue with this, that may be not connected to the topic, so feel free to create another ticket for this, if you think so. In WYSIWYG the groups are shown nicely, but in DataAware, as is shown in my example screenshot, it is confusing, as it is not clear which summary corresponds to which header. Given massive amount of data that the tables are containing, this is unacceptable. Can I somehow, for example, color group headers and summaries in different colors, depending of nesting level, as it is done in my base grid?
I'd much appreciate your help.

Hello. I need to implement additional rendering over DiagramShape(SVG) at run time. Those. for example, one event (element state validation ) occurs and the icons (or strokes with the specified color) of its state are displayed on top of DiagramShape (SVG) elements.

in 13.2.8.0 gives error Unknown server tag 'dx:PanelContent'.
and run in 16.1
What is solution to use aspxcallback in 13.2.8 

I have attached a sample project.
In the form is a layout control with lots of groups and controls.
Run the project and and you will see the right-hand edges of the layout control, and all the controls contained within it, are not visible.
Now resize the form to make it wider. After about 940 pixels (width is displayed in the Status Bar), the  right hand edges become visible and remain anchored to the form edge as expected.
Now make the form narrower. At below about 940 pixels, the  controls all become truncated again.
I presume I have done something wrong with the properties of the layout control, the layout groups/items ofo the individual controls, but I just cannot see it.
Can you  assist?

Dear DevExpress Support Team.
To the style of "dxb: BarButtonItemLinkControl" like below,
Is there a way to set multiple "dxmvvm: EventToCommand"?
I know how to use AssociatedObject of DevExpress.Mvvm.UI.Interactivity.Behavior and how to register multiple events in OnAttached / OnDetaching.
But, I am looking for another way.
 I want to process multiple events of "BarButtonItemLinkControl" with commands implemented in ViewModel.

I have placed a XRPageInfo in PageFotter band with the property RunningBand set to a groupheader.
The GroupHeader used is printed on say each 3 or 4  page but both the current page and the page total is not reset, so say I'm printing 1325 pages, the page footer on page 543 writes "543/1325" but should have indicated "3/4" (assuming the controlling groupband was printed 3 pages before and a new groupband will be printed in  2 pages).
 

Dear Support Team,
Currently i am using one DevExtreme MVC data-grid and chart in same page. Currently for both i am using same datasource.
But for both i have used separate action method. I have also one button for filtering and showing based on the selected text in dropdown.
When i click on button both should get refreshed. So when it refreshed calling again the defined action methods.
Can i use only one action method to load  both control? 
I have found some of the example in jquery.
But i need to do this for MVC.
Please suggest.
Thanks,

Hi everybody.
 I am using devExtreme with Angular 5.
Works great!
But I do concern a little tabout the bundle size after building for production using the the command:
I have tried to be carefull with the imports and not to write sth like "import.. from 'devextreme-angular'.
Instead i tried to import to the lowest level e.g:
..
import { DxPieChartModule } from 'devextreme-angular/ui/pie-chart';
import { DxTabsModule } from 'devextreme-angular/ui/tabs';
import { DxRadioGroupModule } from 'devextreme-angular/ui/radio-group';
import { WsHorizontalTimelineComponent } from './ws-horizontal-timeline/ws-horizontal-timeline.component';
-- 
But the webpack analyszer shows me that the js-Script source ist still huge.
It seems like devExtreme always loads the hole js-files.
(you can see it on the left side of the attached image, 2.64MB).
Is there any way to reduce the bundle for the devExtreme components size further?
Thank you!
 

When an XtraReport using an objectdatasource is saved to a repx file, it (naturally) keeps the full assembly details of the class.
However, we version our classes every day, so a saved .repx file no longer has the correct details of the assembly.
Is there any way to manipulate this before/on loading from the repx file?  We know what the simple name of the assembly would be, that doesn't change, but the version is always different and needs to be the version that is running, not the saved version.
At present we get an exception in LoadLayoutFromXml
Managed Debugging Assistant 'BindingFailure' 
  Message=Managed Debugging Assistant 'BindingFailure' : 'The assembly with display name 'DataLayer' failed to load in the 'Load' binding context of the AppDomain with ID 1. The cause of the failure was: System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'DataLayer, Version=75.2.18.45, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=51786fbf7083e291' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)'

Hi
This is really a follow on question from 
.
I would like to add two additional columns to the grid (that bit is easy enough) they will not be bound to any data source , nor will they need to provide data as explained in the Unbound columns help topic via the GridControl.UnboundColumnData event.  These columns will exist purely to allow the end user to enter some addition information if they so wish.  The general idea is that having filtered data from the provided xml they can add some additional values to certain rows and then the grid will be parsed and new records based on each data row will be created in a table on the backend database.
I have tried setting allowedit to true on the tableview and readonly to false on both the columns I need to edit, but they remain stubbornly un-editable.
How should one do this, assuming that it can be done.?
One other small point.  I have noticed that if I set the TableView ShowTextBoxSelectorColumn property to true (in the example that I posted on the refered ticket and which Ivan amended and sent back) I'm not getting the expected checkboxes to allow the end user to select rows.  Is this specific to the way that this grid is getting it's data or has a bug crept into the code base for the grid?
Many thanks
Dom

Hey
We're buiding a angular 5 application and are interested in devextreme pivot grid. 
 When we present a pivot,
we'd like to use our own components to present data (observable, async) (angular-way)
Is there a way, or are there plans to do 
stuff like implemented in  datagrid?
a really nice approach would be if we could do something like this:
fields: [{
                caption: 'Employee',
                dataField: 'employeeId',
                area: 'row',
                 dataType: 'customEmployeeNameType'
            }]
<dx-pivot-grid>
    <div *dxTemplate="let data of 'customEmployeeNameType'">
        {{(data.value | idToEmployee | async)?.employeeName | displayableNameToString}}
    </div>
</dx-pivot-grid>
We've already seen that we could use  events like format, customizeText, selector etc. but all events have string applied as return type. But we need async stuff...
Thx in advance

Hi Team,
We are planning to host our webapplication with devexpress controls to IBM cloud , will this be supported or do we have any additional settings ? 

Based on data in the report, in the report scripts I am removing controls before the report runs and then attempting to add those controls back after the report is completed running.  I am doing this because the report requires the user to submit parameters and they can submit different parameters and run the report several times.  If I do not add the controls back after the report runs the first time, it will fail for all subsequent runs.
When doing this, I was under the impression that the first script that would ever run when running a report is the report_BeforePrint script and the last script that would ever run is the report_AfterPrint.  It appears, however, that my assumption may be incorrect.
Some of these controls exist in the group footer.  I have noticed that the group footer before_Print and after_Print scripts actually run several times throughout the execution of this report (which is only one page and only represents the group footer 1 time) and that they run after the report_AfterPrint script has run, which is problematic, because the controls are being added back before the final print of the group footer, which is causing my report to appear incorrectly.
Is this intended behavior?  If so, I am curious to know why because it doesn't logically seem to make sense, I would assume report_AfterPrint would mean after the report is done printing, i.e. the entire report and everything in it, and the fact that the group footer_Print scripts would execute so many times to print one footer also seems questionable.
If this is intended behavior, I would like to know if there are scripts that I can use in the way I intend that both 1)only execute 1 time per report generation and 2)one of which will execute before any other scripts in the report and one of which will execute after any other scripts in the report, each and every time, guaranteed.
Please let me know and let me know if you need further information.
Thank you,
Rob Timms 

Hi,
I have two issues which i'll try to describe.
1.
I have a form, which contains many GroupControls and UserControl with LayoutView and MemoEdit on it. Form is kinda long and it doesn't fit whole on screen so it have vertical scrollbar. When i scroll down to layoutview and it isn't fully visible on screen and i click on a card inside layoutview. Vertical position of my form changes and it is set  to show whole layoutview (It scrolls by itself to show me whole LayoutView). Even if it missing very little space. Because of that there's impossible to pick from layoutview row cell which i want to set value from list. I have to click once on layoutview to set it position and after that i'm able to pick values from row. Is there possibility to allow user to pick values instantly without changing form position?
2.
When i'm scrolling down form i'm getting stuck when mouse cursor reach LayoutView/MemoEdit. Then cursor focus is set to child object and it is scrolling inside, even if there's nothing to scroll anymore or at all.  Is there possibility to force scroll focus be always on a parent form, untill i intentionally click on memoedit or layoutview to scroll inside?

Hi Support,
How can we set the DetailRowMode of an ASPxGridListEditor in code. We can set via the model, but woud like to set this as via a controller for alllistviews.
Below the code so far.
    public partial class DetailRowModeController : ViewController<ListView> {
        protected override void OnViewControlsCreated() {
            base.OnViewControlsCreated();
            if (Frame.Context != TemplateContext.LookupControl & Frame.Context != TemplateContext.LookupWindow) {
                ASPxGridListEditor gridListEditor = View.Editor as ASPxGridListEditor;
                if (gridListEditor != null) {
                    gridListEditor.Grid.SettingsDetail.ShowDetailRow = true;
                    gridListEditor.Grid.SettingsDetail.ShowDetailButtons = true;
                    gridListEditor.Grid.SettingsBehavior.ConfirmDelete = true;

Hi,
Good day.
I was wondering if you guys can help me with some issues I am having. Somehow I could not select another item using SelectBox and the Tagbox when I am accessing it using these browsers in a mobile device. The selection does not update the display and it does not fire the event.
Chrome in Iphone/Ipad Pro
Safari in  Iphone/Ipad Pro
Stock browser in ZTE Axon 7 Android
IE browser Microsoft Lumia  950 (windows Phone)
It only works with Chrome browser in the ZTE Axon 7 Android. 
I have no problems with them when using any browsers in my computer, it just does not work in browsers of mobile devices.
Regarding my project set up, I needed both DevExpress and DevExtreme so I created a project based on DevExpress Template Gallery with DevExpress MVC (Responsive). When it was created, i added DevExtreme  to the project and it created the necessary settings and bundle. 
I saw an article here on how to set up a project when both DevExpress and devExtreme are used
I followed the instructions there, where I removed the declarations from the devextremebundle and add the registry of scripts and css in the _rootLayout so the DevExpress components will be registered first and attached here a sample project (removed the devexpress dlls and packages as it is too big to upload). They work when I use the Chrome simulator for mobile devices, however, when I deployed and accessed the page using those devices and browsers above, it's stuck. I am wondering if there's something wrong with my set up.
I also tried to add dx_viewport class in the body or 
    <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
but to no avail.
Hope you can assist me on this.
Thank you very much.
Best regards,

Hello DevExpress team,
I've a strange issue with a chart.
I'm work with MVVM architecture, and I've a chart to display 4 curves dynamically. I want to be able to suppress some point from the chart (with a listbox near it). I'm be able to do it, by recreate the collection of data.
But, I have two issues:
-If I zoom in/out the chart, and I try to refresh it, the autoscale of the both Axis are not working and the both range take values [0..1].
I was be able to fix this issue with this ticket : 
I create a button to send function "SetAuto()" at the both range.
But, after that, I have a new issue :
-If i refresh the data, I can see only the first curve, and not the others ones. But, if I zoom in, the others appear. I cannot explain why.
Can you help me on this strange behavior ?
Thank you for your help.
Kind regards,
Maxime Lozach

Hello,
I have a MasterDetail GridControl.  Each Details section displays the count total of each group.  Is there a way to display to total of the details count's in the Master's Total Summary? 

Hi DevExpress,
I observe strange behaviour of grouped rows in your grid control. When I double-tap on grouped row to expand/collapse child rows, it only works when grid is scrolled down a bit. Otherwise it does nothing and grouped rows cannot be expanded/collapsed.
Obviously, it's worst when grid doesn't have enough rows to enable scrolling and therefore expanding/collapsing never works.
I've attach my sample project.
Kind regards

Hi
I'm having some problems with the RichEditDocumentServer class when converting a specific .docx file to PDF. This document contains a form with clickable checkboxes  which are not rendered when exporting the document to PDF. Exporting in MS Word 2016 renders the checkboxes correctly.
The document in question comes from one of our customers. I do not know exactly how the form was created, but it seems to differ from the form created in Word 2016, because if I use that to add my own checkbox this will show up correctly in the PDF.
This simple program reproduces the issue.
I'm attaching the docx file with almost everything stripped but a single checkbox.

 Hello DevExpress Team,

Hello,
Is it somehow possible to filter the ShowCheckBoxSelectorColumn column?
My grid looks like this and in the ShowCheckBoxSelectorColumn is no filter possible.

I have set up a navigation pane control and added three pages to it, each with a couple of controls on them. I can switch between pages just fine, but whenever I click on the currently selected page once more it kind of closes. That by itself wouldn't be too much of a problem, but whichever page I click on next won't show its controls either until I click *yet* another page.
Is this desired behaviour? Even if clicking on the active page selector would close the current page I would at least expect all controls to appear again when another page gets selected after that.
I have disabled the Expand/Collapse button in my project but the same thing happens when using those.
Best regards,
Thomas Touzimsky

Hello
What is the best way to build responsive  ASP MVC application with Razor and your controls. Especially I means edit forms. What do you recommend ? MVC FormLayout, your bootstrap controls , DevExtreme Form , any other way ?
Could you help me to choose the best ?

Hi DevExpress,
I noticed that RowTap event of your grid control is fired twice for single tap (at least on Android, haven't try it on iOS).
Attached please find my sample project.
As a workaround, I can filter the event based on timestamp. But since it's probably a bug, you should know...
Kind regards

Dear DevExpress team,
one of our customers has the problem that his Sophos Firewall ( Sophos UTM 9) detects POST request as possible SQL injections.
Log entry:
We examined this problems and discovered the actual problem: The name attributes of the input elements of the DevExpress ASP.NET components are automatically generated. For example: ctl00$mainContent$ComboBoxLanguage$DDD$L. In the POST request this name is sent as argument name with the specific values. 
The firewall checks this argument names for special characters to avoid possible SQL injections. There is only a maximum of 3 special characters allowed, but based on the DOM location the generated name attribut contains more than 3 $-signs. 
Is there any way to  avoid this problem? Is there any way to change how the name attribute is generated?

Hello,
I am working with the Dev Extreme  Scheduler in Angular 5. I have a quick question that the person I asked in the chat window was unable to answer and advised me to contact you. I am looking for a way to set only certain dates/times as selectable or unselectable. Not just a min/max, as I do see that capability, but instead setting it up so, say, an appointment can only be made within a certain block of time on a particular Monday, a different block on a Wednesday, etc? Or, An appointment can be made anytime, *except for during certain blocks of time. How would I go about doing that?
Thank you,

Hello!
I am trying to copy/paste data from/into my grid. I have a custom type for the cell values(containing different properties, using CustomDisplayText event for displaying). 
however now I also have to adapt copy/paste to be able to modify my grid by CTRL+C/CTRL+V or equivalent.
So I followed the instructions found on:
Currently I have these  options set on my gridView:
 now when I select cells across multiple rows and copy it to the clipboard, everything seems to be fine. Pasting it into e.g. excel yields the expected result(copying also the formatting, using the ToString Method of object stored in the cell for the text).
I tried to handle the ClipboardRowPasting event to copy the values like that: 
I get 1 event per row copied, containing all destination columns with the ToString value of my custom object. 
So far so good. 
I update my values using the row number i get from (ClipboardRowPastingEventArgs)e.RowHandle for the first row.
But for every following event(1 for each row copied), the RowHandle I get for the Event stays the same(so I keep overwriting the same row over and over again).
Is there a way I can increase the row handle, or do I have to trigger row validation or something to get the next row on the next event?
A better way of doing it would be to add a custom copy/paste mode for my custom object(so i can serialize/deserialize the object), So I don't have to rely on the ToString method. But I don't know if that is even possible at the moment.
thanks in advance for your help.

Hello,
We have a DockLayoutManager containing several LayoutPanel, one of them containing a text box and a read-only TreeListControl. And since we updated DevExpress in our project from version 17.1.7 to 17.2.5, we noticed that if the LayoutPanel of the TreeListControl is not focused, clicking on an already selected item of the tree doesn't focus the TreeListControl but the text box instead.
This breaks our automated tests of the user interface and keyboard navigation in the application.
I have attached a sample with two identical projects using both versions of DevExpress:
- Open the 17.2 version and click on the first item (already selected) of the tree -> The text box is focused instead of the TreeListControl
- Click on another item of the tree -> The tree behaves as expected
- Click on the button to move the focus away from the LayoutPanel of the tree
- Click again on the currently selected item of the tree -> The bug happens again
- Redo the same test with the 17.1 version -> The tree works as expected all the time
Could you fix this regression?
Thank you for your help.

When I set a item visible true or false it scrolls to the top of the page.
I reproduce the error in the following plunker:
You need to open the  preview in the windowed mode like the attached file. Then click on "Show the Phone" checkbox, then it will scroll to the top.
Other similar error:
The "scroll to top" also happens on the Tab Panel
Open it on the preview in the windowed mode then scroll to the botton, then click on the last visible "More space", it will scroll to the top as well.
Thank you

Hello,
I need to implement a devextreme multiselect dropdown box with simple list view bind,
I found the following link 
but both of the examples are tree view and grid view .
Can you provide me a solution to implement devextreme multiselect dropdown box with list view.
I have also watched the dxtagbox but that is not what is required , I need list view with check box, like the attachment.
Please find the attachment.

Hi folks, 
I've been looking  on the knowledge base for some examples of how to ripple the changes to a form's look and feel to all controls but haven't found a solution that covers captions on layout control items and grid columns. 
In the attached example i've used some code from the knowledgebase to update the font on the form but if you click the button on the form an change the font the grid columns/titles and the layout item captions dont change. 
Whats the correct way to achieve this ? Do I need to walk the control hierarchy and update them ?
Thanks

Hi. I wonder if it's possible to somehow translate a saved layout from a WinForms PivotGrid (XML) to an MVC PivotGrid?
Details:
Our previous tool in WinForms? allowed users to save a PivotGrid layout to file (SaveLayoutToStream). We are now moving this tool to MVC, and it would be really good to have automatic conversion of saved layouts.

1.  if EndValue contains negative value - user can't move marker (e.g. StartValue = 0 EndValue = -100 ).  If EndValue is positve - it works 
2.  Bar should be drawn from 0.  (See attachment)

                          EndValue="{TemplateBinding EndValue}"
                          ...>
            ...
            <dxga:LinearScale.Markers>

Hello,
I have a situation where in a newly created database in my XAF application, I set permissions on my types depending on my user roles.
So in my simple user, I need to hide a couple of objects from my navigation menu. The code I use is like the following:
In my updater class this runs normally and should hide the WorkOrderCategory from the menu .
Only problem is my WorkOrderCategory does not inherit from the XPObject but from the BaseObject. That is the only difference I see so far
from the other objects that behave normally and they are hidden from my menus. I can not change the object now since it is already used so what can I do to hide this object?
 

I have a softball question.  I want to create a fairly simple ASP.NET form to allow my users to input some fields, click a submit button, and update a database.  I can handle all of the validation, database stuff, etc., but believe or not I am getting stuck on the "best" way to layout the controls (textboxes, labels, buttons) on my Webform.  I could call old school and use a HTML-tables, but it seems like I am missing a really cool control in my arsenal.  Is it Panels, Formviews, what?  Obviously, I would love to just be able to drag controls and place them.
Can you just guide me a bit on one or two of the best ways to accomplish this with my DevExpress toolbox?  Thanks! 

Is it possible to specify more than two colors for a fill gradient?

Hi,
When we edit a cell in DxDataGrid the user needs to tab out or press enter for the change to be updated in the data source.
Is there a way for the data source to get updated when the user edits and moves out of the cell (without pressing enter etc)?

Hi,
Can we use Report Designer in DevExtreme MVC Application? Is it possible? 
We tried the ticket that ID is T507978 about the solution. But we don`t see report designer on the page correctly. You can find screenshot in attached .
Thank you. 

Hello,
some months ago I sent the ticket 
. I would like to discuss the problem anew. You recommended a workaround in T500313  to use an
invisible "fake" data field to achieve what is needed. I followed that recommendation and it worked at a first glance. But in the meantime
I had to implement quite a big bunch of workarounds to get rid of the negative side effects of that approach. 
That's why I would like to ask you anew whether there woudn't be a more straightforward solution now available for that problem instead of using
an invisible field. 
The attachment describes the presentation problem I have maybe clearer then in my old ticket. I need to have the "data header" text of the
pivot grid grand total column even if there is just one data area column. It contains important information for our users about the meaning of the content of that column. Actually that behaviour of the pivot grid should be considered as a bug which should be solved without workarounds from the outside.
Best regards
Matthias

How to reset/remove ControlStyles to all object on the report. 
For example:
Struct of report
DetailReportBand1 -> Table1 ->cellTable1, celltable2, celltable3
DetailBand1 ->controlstyleGLOBAL - this is name of controlstyle
Table1 -> controlStyle1
cellTable1 ->controlStyle1
cellTable2 -> none
cellTable3 -> controlStyle2
and now I want to set up Controlstyle2 for every objet on DetailReportBand1.
How to do this in simply way?

Hi Team,
I am trying to create a custom control with 7 ToggleSwitch controls with in a StackPanel. 
Content of the control will be a binary number  ex: 0000001.
0 - Checked 
1 - UnChecked 
Now I am not able to figure out how can we assign these values to each ToggleSwitch when we change the content. ex: 0000011.

Hey!
Is there any way to get the global index of a node in a TreeList? 
I know there's GetNodeIndex but that returns the index within its parent. I need something like GetVisibleIndexByNode but which counts the hidden nodes as well and I can't really find anything like this.
Thank you,

Hi,
I need a function to read the specific cell clicked from a Pivot chart  having multiple groups using GetUnderlyingData function
For Instance:
please take the pivot grid in the following example
if I click the cell having value of 204, it should return me these values
 
state = albama
category = bike wash
units sold = 204
etc.
so basically i need to know that which row and which column (along-with their parent group value i-e category in the example) was clicked.
 
Thanks 

Hi,
I've read the large database Bind to EF article but I do not understand what the BindToEF statement requires.
I would normally place search controls outside of a grid that a use can enter data into to perform a search.
I want to simplify this by only showing a gridview. The user can use the column filters to retrieve the data they wish to see.
To bind a gridview In the controller I would normally fill a viewmodel with some data and then assign the model to the grid.
For example: a partial controller for a grid in a view:
the linq data retrieval (had to keep it as sql because of complexity, but normally issue a standard linq statement).
:
In the example I've seen installed on my pc the grid contains the statement:
I don't understand what LargeDatabaseDataProvider.DB.Emails is?
Is this the same as calling SearchTiffindex  method above?
In this project I use an ADO.Net Entity Data Model. The context is called: netdocs_hr_mvccoreEntitie
The table I am trying to bind to is called : TiffIndex_SelfridgesAP
Apologies that this is so long winded!!

Graham

Hello,
I'm having trouble getting the customLoad for state storing to work with Angular 5 and a Native promise.  The state that is passed to the promise resolve isn't what's loaded into the grid.
See plunker
I should note that in my solution I'm loading via http as shown below. 

Hi,
I am using Angular 4.3.4 at the moment.
I am trying to give some customised labels and tooltips to a slider , and finding it quite hard to do so.
In the component, we pass in a model which contains a list of custom labels for our sliders. When the sliders are being displayed, the should show the custom labels instead of the numerical value.
I try to access the local model in the component (passed in as an @Input) but it's saying that 'this' is undefined.
I have an example plunker here:
I think that your [format] input is executing the method in the context of the slider itself? Instead of within the context of the component it's placed inside. If you check the console, it states that it is unable to read 'customLabels' of undefined, even though 'customLabels' is just a property on 'this'.
Is there a [customizeTooltip] or [customizeText] Input for both the tooltip and label for the DxSlider?
If not - is there a way I can pass both the value and the array of custom labels into the method? In all of the demos you refrain from specifying the parameters.
Thanks,
C
 

I have a grid lookup control that allows the user to search based on either a numeric or string value.  I'm using KeyUp JS on the grid lookup to GetText of the lookup, check the length of text and determine if the text is numeric, then firing the PerformCallback on the grid.  I'm running into two issues:
1.  PerformCallback is firing before my JS is executed.  I'm not sure if the gridlookup control is already causing a 'behind the scenes' JS function that is built into the control
2.  I'm sending 2 parameters to the server in PerformCallback() and I'm seeing really weird characters coming through. 
Currently my client/server code is as follows
ASP.NET
 JS
C#
Please let me know if this request makes sense and or if you require more detail, etc.
Thanks

I am in the process of creating a new application and wanted to see if I could get some guidance from you guys on the best approach since I will be building it with your components.  I am planning to create something using WPF with MVVM architecture.  I have looked at both the scaffolding wizard and MIF and am interested in something along those lines but neither of them is an exact fit for me.
I would like a UI where I have a navigation section to open views, either as a layout panel or buttons in the ribbon bar.  I would like the views to open as tabbed documents.
The scaffolding wizard is great for getting something up and running quickly without having to write any code, but it doesn't seem like it's set up very well for incremental extension i.e. I want to add new functionality down the road.  Also, I need to add some features that are not purely CRUD. I'm not sure how to best integrate that into the structure of the generated app.
 MIF might be a better fit because it offers a navigation view and creates the documents as tabs.  But my application is going to be fairly small so I'm wondering if MIF might be overkill.  It seems like there is a lot of configuration involved.  I was also unclear from the documentation how Entity Framework integrates into the MIF design.  I would like to use dependency injection of a context factory.
So if you needed to build a smallish (~10 views) application with a tabbed MDI interface that contains some CRUD views and some other views where no data manipulation is needed , how would you approach it using DevExpress components?  An iterative build process is necessary as all of the necessary features are not known at this time, so the application will need to be extended in the future to add more features.

I am using the pivot grid in compact mode and have come across two issues that I need resolved. The first issue is with pivot.OptionsFilter.ShowOnlyAvailableItems . I have applied a filter to my grid using the following code
The filter that I applied to the Company field works correctly and is also applied automatically to the Stores field as well and the drop down only shows stores that are available under the applied filter as expected. In the case of the HO Category the filter works when I drag it onto the grid and only the applicable HO Categories appear on the grid but when I access the dropdown on the filter itself I can still see all the other HO Categories that are not supposed to be accessible, how can I make sure that only the ones that a user has access to appear in the dropdown menu of HO Categories?
My second question is regarding the accessibility of the dropdown function for HO Department and HO Menu Item. I have included a screenshot of the filters when applied to  the grid. Only the HO Category filter has a dropdown to select specific categories. I need that dropdown to appear on the other two filters as well how can I make this happen?
Any help will be greatly appreciated,
Nate

please ignore this post for now, i will have to change a few things in my architecture and when i run into problems, i'll be coming back at you..
hi there.
i am having problems with the edit form  of the datagid.
this:
is a simple example.
please go into edit mode and see that the form is not built. as this is a really simple one, i cannot see what should be the problem. 
used in a standalone form it works:  
in my project, when i use the same definition of items i use for the datagrid's column option, it works, but i cannot reproduce it here.
i also do not really understand how the columns definition and the editing's form definiton work together.
for example i can define an editCellTemplate in one of the coumns . how does this intertwine with the definition for the corresponding datafield defined in the form? 
what i actually want is to have a grid form that displays a tabpanel. in this tabpanel there should be tagboxes.
i just can't get my head around it because it behaves not very consistent.
for example for tagboxes that are outside the tabpanel, when i define the editortype in the form-option, with showSelectionControls = true, the selection controls are radioboxes!!! what is working  for them is to define an editCellTemplate. but this has to come from the columns definition. but this won't work for the fields under the tabpanel, but these will work by the aforementioned defintion in the form.  (okay, i would not know how to set the value, but that may be the next step :)
what is best working is the editCellTemplate, but as mentioned, it does not work with the tabbed items. is this expected behaviour?

Hi,
I am receiving the error: "BIndingSource cannot be its own data source. Do not set the DataSource and DataMember properties to values that refer back to BindingSource:.
I have a binding source object  "tradeAlertBindingSource1".
The InitializeComponent() sets it's Data source  to be typeof(TradeAlert);
(I have just removed this in case it was causing the issue)
It further sets the GridControl's DataSource to this object.
I go on to set the DataSource of this binding source in my own code to a list of type: BindingList<TradeAlert>
 I am not sure if it is the grid throwing the error or something I am doing wrong in the application?
Note. the  bindingList is receiving new/updated/deleted items on a separate thread.

Is there possibility to force scroll focus be always on a parent form, untill i intentionally click on memoedit or layoutview to scroll inside?

Hi,
we are using DevExpress WinForms controls in our product and are experiencing following issue.
When trying to change the text of TreeListNode, exception is thrown: Object is currently in use elsewhere. 
Please check the complete stacktrace in attachment.
We have experienced similar issue on several places already and some of my colleagues already reported number of tickets, but they were never resolved.
Unfortunately this exception is really rare and we cannot reproduce it reliably in our application - so there is not possibility to create sample app where this problem occurs. 
We would really appreciate if this can be fixed, since we cannot reliably fix it on our side and it's causing issues for our customers.
 
Could you have look at it and answer if there is some workaround or fix we can do?
In case of any further questions, please contact me on email below.

Hi,
I need an additional column from the lookup  result. The second column is a boolean, which I would like to display as a read only checkbox.
So I have a grid with 2 lookup columns, bound to the same field. The first column can be selected, the second column is the result of the selection in the first column. The display member of this second column is a boolean, but is is shown as text.
How can I display a checkbox in the second column?

Hi,
We are implementing devexpress MVC reports in my project.

 Please give us solution build and demonstrate for this issue.

Hi - We are using DevExpress Hierarchical Grid to load data for a Report. My first half of the page contains Search Criteria and bottom half has DevExpress Grid. Now my data gets loaded correctly. In my case, we have 3 level of grid and suppose grid gets populated with 1 Parent records having 2 child records and each child having 5 grand child records.
Now when I click to expand First Child, its grand child gets displayed and then I scroll down to expand  Second Child. As soon as I click to expand my second child, focus automatically shifts to top of the grid and I have to again scroll down to view grand child of second child.
I have attached a screenshot explaining the sequence of events. Please have a look and suggest a solution for this. 

Hi,
I build a application with the Devexpress WinForms Components.
The application is running without any problem on normal PCs,  
On release the application should run on a terminal server, where the users can connect to with the remote desktop application (RDP).
The application keeps randomly freezing on the terminal servers for the users connect with RDP.
Do you know if there are any problems with the UI Components for terminal use?
I know about the problem with the popup controls and solved it with the following code:
Are there other configurations or sources of errors I have to consider?
neither my applicationlogs or the windows eventlogs gave me any useful hints for the reasons behind this freezes.
Thank you in advance 

Hi,
My client really likes the DevAV Demo solution.  So I am trying to duplicate the Employees area with my own entity (Matters).  To that end, on the Employees.aspx page, there are three user controls: EmployeeEditForm, TaskEditForm and EvaluationEditForm.  I note in the markup code that these are referenced as:
   <div id="EditFormsContainer">
        <dx:EmployeeEditForm ID="EmployeeEditForm" runat="server" />
        <dx:TaskEditForm ID="TaskEditForm" runat="server" />
        <dx:EvaluationEditForm ID="EvaluationEditForm" runat="server" />
    </div>
however, when I drag and drop my "MatterEditForm"  over, it comes across as:
   <div id="EditFormsContainer">
        <uc1:MatterEditForm ID="MatterEditForm1" runat="server" />
        <dx:TaskEditForm ID="TaskEditForm" runat="server" />
        <dx:EvaluationEditForm ID="EvaluationEditForm" runat="server" />
    </div>
This seems to cause problems in compiling etc.  Why is my user control showing "uc1"  and your example shows "dx:" ??
Do you have any documentation on how this was built. I am a little frustrated trying to duplicate the same behaviours with my entity.
TIA,
Miles 

Hi,
When you expand/collapse a treenode multiple times with Angular 2+, the animation seems to be broken. It works the first time, but the second time, the children just appear after a while, without the animation. I tried using the latest Chrome and IE versions. Other samples (Javascript, AngularJs) don't seem to have this problem.

Hello, since the update from 15.2.6 to 17.1.8 the TdxGPImage class seems to behave differently.
Creating a "screenshot" of a form and drawing it like this:
shows a different result because TdxGPImage.CreateFromHBitmap now checks if the image has a 32bit depth and at least one pixel has a value greater that 0 in the reserved part of the color information. (see TdxCustomSmartImage.CreateHandleFromBitmap)
It seems impossible the change this behavior, do you have any advice how to restore the old behavior and ignore the rgbReserved information?

Hello
When the display scaling and layout are set to 125% on Windows 10, the display speed of cxGrid 1 DBTableView 1 slows down.
The data is MariaDB's 10.2, using FireDAC's TFDQuery.
The table has three VARBINARY (30), one Integer, about 20000 records.
There is no problem when the scale is 100%, but if it is 125%, the speed will decrease to such an extent that it can not be used.
Is there a way to improve it?
Thank you.

When my program is in 200% DPI mode, checkboxes in a cxGrid,  but also the indicator are not nice sharp images but the look resized from 100% DPI. 
 I have read the "How to Create a Per-Monitor DPI-Aware Application" but couldn't find a solution.
 This also is the case with the cxSpinEdit where the arrows are not sharp.
I have included a screenshot to clearify what I mean.
 It is not really a bug, but it is also not very nice.


Hello DevExpress Team,
Current Project Structure: XPO to "Serializable Object Layer Service" to WPF as Client
I have below two questions
 
2) I need InsertOnSubmit, DeleteOnsubmit functionality in XPO same as Linq to Sql. 
Please reply me as soon as possible..
Thanks in Advance. 

For some reason, users are unable to paste filters from their clipboard into the Gridview search bar. They can right click and click paste however the CTRL+V shortcut doesn't seem to work. How can i add functionality to support the keyboard shortcut?

Support,
The data that I am binding my dashboard to has 8 series of monthly data.  In the card view I would like to show the percent difference between the last two data points in each series.  Essentially each card shows the percent change compared to last month.  The data set has 3 columns (Series, Date, Value) I have the Series bound to series and Value bound to Actual and nothing bound to target.  It there a way to either create a calculate field or build and expression that would return the last and previous data points?
Thanks,
Mark 

Hi DevEx Team,
i have  a SingleChoiceAction where I load the ChoiceActionItems in the Code.
 How can I change the Color of the Background of an ChoiceActionItem?

Is it possible to disable or prevent recursive node checking on a TcxTreeList?  I know with .NET there seems to be a OptionsBehavior.AllowRecursiveNodeChecking property, but I don't see the equivalent for VCL.
I could simply add a column of checkboxes, although I'd prefer to use the CheckState property on the nodes if possible since it looks better with a tree structure.

I want to display error icons in my RibbonForm on different controls. It's working fine with controls on the form, but do nothing on RepositoryItem used in the Ribbon. Do you have a receipt for it ?
I use a line of code like this to achieve it on the form:
        myDxErrorProvider.SetError(textEdit1, "some error message", ErrorType.Warning);    // Works fine
        myDxErrorProvider.SetError(dateEdit1, "some other error message", ErrorType.Critical);    // Works fine
My difficulty is first to access the editor inside the RepositoryItem. I saw that I can get it by casting the sender in Validating event, but this as no effect. I think that behind the hood such editor (in repositoryItem) are kind of volatile control created on the fly  when editing and maybe discarded immediatly after.
For RepositoryItem, I tried this on Validating Event of RepositoryItems :
        private void OnValidating(object sender, CancelEventArgs e)
        {
            var baseEdit = sender as BaseEdit;
            if (baseEdit != null)
            {
                  baseEdit.ErrorText = "something";     // works for TextEdit, but disapear when losing focus;  don't works with DateEdit
                  dxErrorProvider.SetError(baseEdit, "Error in edit...", ErrorType.Warning);   // Do nothing
            }
        }
 
 

I am not able to filter the data on custom filter of header checklist filer on modified column data .For More under stand check attached image.
Please provide the solution. 

I noticed there are two choices for ShowDropDownOnFocus (Always or Never).  I am having a hard time deciding between which of these to use.
I think a nice middle ground would be to use 'Never' with a drop down arrow on the right (similar to ASPxComboBox) -- see attacjed.  
So my suggestion would be to have an attribute something like...
DisplayDropDownArrow (default to false to not break existing code). 
Thanks  

How do you change the date format that shows up in the header for the work week view? Specifically, I want to use the format  "{0:dddd}".
There was another similar support ticket utilizing a Date HeaderPresenter class, but when I tried, it caused the entire ScheduleControl area to be displayed as a gray panel.

Hi,
I noticed that by default i can tab between the panels of SplitContainerControl. Is there a way to disable that?

Hi,
We need to export Data from cxGrid to excel. We are using the function   
cxGridExportLink   
We have a problem keeping Grid data format : 
if we  use Native Format : the currency sign appear in the numeric column ( we don't want this), we want no sign by default
if we are NOT using the native format, all data are strings so we can't do calculation in Excel
How can we provide to keep numeric type of columns without having the currency  ?
(i provide a small exemple, with my excel files, and screen copy to show you how we are working). 
thank you
PS : i was thinking about the column field format is not good but i don't know how to change on the fly.

I have a textedit on a form that the user can't edit directly.  I want him to be able to position the cursor in the textedit and hit enter.  Another form comes up where he can select valid values to put into the textedit.
I  was hoping I could put something here on the else path so that the only keydown accepted is Enter.
 

Hello,
I have some combo boxes nested in user controls which are dynamically added withing an ASPxGridView EditTemplate.  I am trying to find a way to fire the server-side " ASPxComboBox1_Validation" code without setting the "Autopostback" for the control (as that causes everything to be auto-generated again.)
I have set the cbx as follows:
Is there a way to force the server-side validation from the client-side?
Thank you!

Hello DevExpress,
For some reason, I am unable to get the adaptivity work for the below grid... the columns do not shrink or hide...
Is this because I am setting column widths? If so, is there a way to set some proportions between columns... for instance, have the name double size of phone number....etc?
Thank you!

Hi there,
I've a DataListViewController with the code below. How can I achieve, that the action is only visible, if the underlaying business class (the view) is empty. My goal is, to only show the "import data action" only, if there is no data in the view, so that the user can start an initial import.
I tried to extend 'protected override void UpdateActionActivity(ActionBase action)' method with somethin like this: int count = View.ObjectSpace.GetObjectsCount(typeof(ZipCode), CriteriaOperator.Parse("Count()")); to get the count of rows. But this seems not to work or I do something wrong




thx a lot

The following code is used to generate an ASPxPanel within the cell of an ASPxGridView.  That panel consist of ASPxButtons, generated in code from the list of values within ListPhrases.
The standard behavior works as expected.  If two buttons are generated and we click on the first one then that button is checked (it appears as pushed down).  If we click on the second button then the first one is unchecked and the second one becomes checked.
What we also want is to be able to click on any checked button to remove that check, and have none of the buttons checked.
The three lines in comments are my attempt at removing that check.  The first one was the desired code, but it does not work.  The second one works but we (obviously) do not want a popup (the alert).  The third line works but we're nervous about the 50 millisecond delay.
What would be a better approach?
 

One of the reasons for this is the use of a browser's built-in spell checker during data entry; but ti's also very useful when developing to be able to access the Inspect menu.

Hi Guys,
So I have several user controls that have DXGrids in them. They all have the search panel enabled by default on them. The search is REALLY slow.
I have done some searching on the site. I have verified that all my columns are bound using FieldNames, I have specified the specific columns to search in, and the grid is bound to an observable collection that is loaded before the search even happens.
The grid only has about 500 rows in it. Obviously it gets even worse when I load the complete data set. Right now it is user selectable, between viewing all records and viewing only records that aren't archived. Non-archived records are around 500. Complete data sets are around 1300 rows.
The other odd thing is, it seems to be worse when the user is on wireless Vs. our wired network. I never see the UI stop responding on wired networks, but if the user is using wireless it will cause the entire UI thread to stop responding. I find this really perplexing as the data that is being searched is already loaded from the database. 
Any guidance would be appreciated. The other odd thing is, I have many other sections of this app that the grid's search very fast. They are all configured the same way, other than different data collections. But all collections are still observable collections in the ViewModel.
thanks Casey 

We sometimes experience the data grid header position being slightly out of sync with the grid contents.  Usually the difference is approximately the width of the scrollbar.  We have seen the issue in both directions- off to the left or right.  We have also seen it on both IE11 and Chrome.  Using Chrome with this example: 
if you scroll all the way to the right, the alignment is off.  Please see the attached screen capture.
Again, we see this in other cases as well, but those may be much more difficult to recreate.   Can this be resolved in the next release?
Thanks,
Justin 

When using popup edit form  tabs work fine, but when I use the Enter Key, it sends me back to the previous page.
VB.Net 

I'm very nearly ready to pull the trigger on buying a subscription to DevExpress, and I'm trialing the product by converting an existing application to use the spreadsheetcontrol instead of using Excel.  There is one critical feature in Excel that I believe is missing from this control, and that's the ability to add custom number formats with characters. 
In Excel, you can format a cell to display the format  {#,##0.0 "HP"}, which take a number value like 110.00124, and formats it as 110.0 HP.  Displaying the scientific units of numbers is critical for my project, and I can't seem to get it to work.  The spreadsheet control ignores the above format, just displays an unformatted number.

Our customers use the Next Page button to jump the top of the next page to the top of the viewer.
They want to be able to use the keyboard shortcut advertised by the ribbon, but unfortunately the viewer seems to handle the keystroke and prevent the button from taking effect.
Rather than triggering the Next Page functionality, PgDn currently controls the viewer scrollbar which has a very different effect than what our customers want. For almost any zoom level it does not start put the top of the next page at the top of the viewer.
This issue exists in both the ReportPrintTool and the customizable ribbon preview form.

Hi,
I need to create a report from a dynamic dataset, that is, the dataset does not always throw the same columns.
Thank you.

When the height of the data grid is tall enough that it should not require a vertical scrollbar, one appears anyway.  The range of the scrollbar varies between different browsers and different systems- it is almost 0 on my Surface with Chrome, but much larger on IE11.  On another developer's machine, with Chrome it is even larger than my machine with IE, despite loading the same web page.  When this extraneous scrollbar exists, the misaligned column header issue seems to be more common.  The issue can be seen in the attached image, and in this example:
Can we get a fix in the next release?
Thanks,

Only two columns in my data grid are editable. Is there a way to preserve the row in the data grid, while displaying the editable columns in the form?

Hi,
We are looking at changing the design of our application and in the past, we have extensively used CSS to overwrite the default themes supplied by DevExpress. 
We have found however that some of the updates you supply will then break the styles used so we have to then fix this in our application.
Would we be better off using the properties available in each control (i.e grids, menu, tab controls etc) or is CSS still the best way to go in terms of styling? We are looking for the best performance and any gain we can make is what we are after.
If going down the CSS route is what's best for performance, then would we be better off using a theme provided by you and modifying it or creating our own theme? Again we are after the best performance.
Thanks

Hello support,
I have a pdf document that has form fields in it (may or may not have been created by DevExpress).
End Goal: Move the text field to a different position on the pdf
When i move the mouse over the textbox the cursor turns to a little hand, so the viewer is recognizing that it's a field.
I can get the current position by using the PDFViewer.GetDocumentPosition
but basically i want the Cursor to turn to a hand (which it does) -> left click and hold -> move to a different position -> let go of mouse button -> move the selected formcontrol to the new position.
I'm crazy I know!  :)
Any thoughts?
Thank in advance!!!

I need to export a chart (ChartControl with XYDiagram2D) in a scalable vector graphics format (pdf, xps or svg). When I use ChartControlBase.ExportAsPdf, a pdf with a bitmap is created instead of a vector graphic. I looked through the support center, but could not find a solution for WPF/DXCharts. Could you please let me know if there is a way to achieve  this?

Hello:
Please see sample here:
1) On click of change button, I'm trying to set the itemOption as below:
it does not like the space in the "Group Two".
2) However, if I just change the "Group Two" to "GroupTwo" and still keep the space in the "Country info", it does work.
So, how would I set itemOption when the captions/titles contain spaces and why is the behavior different?
3) Ideally, I would like to set the itemOption using the dataField name and not by the captions/titles.. Is there an option for this??
Thanks!

I am trying to iterate through all of the layout control groups in my form, and duplicate the structure on an accordion control. The idea being, that when someone clicks on the accordion control, the cursor is then taken directly to the layout control group in question, and the first control INSIDE is selected. I have it ALMOST working based on other articles here using the following code:
The problem is, the point of using an accordion control is that I want to duplicate the parent\child relationship of the layout control groups. Often times there are layout control groups INSIDE other layout control groups (hence the recursive nature of the code above). 
1. Under  "AddToNavBar" I want to first check if this LayoutControlGroup HAS a parent, in which case I'll add it as an item UNDER it's parent. I also want to check to see if it has any children that are also layoutcontrolgroups. If it does, I'll add them as GROUPS, if not, as ELEMENTS.
2. I'd also like to know, when clicking on these codes, how can I LOCATE and SELECT the layoutcontrolgroup in question? 

Please see the below Dashboard markup specially settings.Height = new Unit(98, UnitType.Percentage).
This setting prevents to display dashboard in Chrome but IE works fine.
In Chrome, dashboard displays either remove the Height setting or set the height in pixel.
The reason to have the height set 100% is without this the height IE displays unnecessary vertical scrollbar.
    @Html.DevExpress().Dashboard(settings =>
{
    settings.Name = "Dashboard";
    settings.InitialDashboardId = ViewBag.DashboardFile;
    settings.AllowExportDashboardItems = true;
    settings.AllowExportDashboard = true;
    settings.Height = new Unit(100, UnitType.Percentage);
    settings.WorkingMode = DevExpress.DashboardWeb.WorkingMode.Viewer;
    settings.PdfExportOptions.ChartSizeMode = DevExpress.DashboardCommon.ChartExportSizeMode.Stretch;
}).GetHtml()
Can you give me an answer why chrome not displaying with the height percentage set?

Hello,
I'm trying  to create an app where the user can drag and drop nodes from an "account" treelist (to the left) to a "header" treelist ( to the right), and then back. The left account list is a one level list, and the right header list  is in four levels, where the accounts always should be placed below the least level, the fifth.
The dragdrop action from left to right works, but all data is lost (or at least not visual).
The dragdrop action from right (only fifth level) to left should make the node to be placed at root level in the left list.  The data should of cause follow.
Hope you can understand what I mean/want?
Best regards

I am trying to do a simple operation where I save the layout of a form (all items in the LayoutControl1) to XML, then restore it later. The idea is that I want end users to be able to modify their layout and save it as their "favorite" and load it as needed. One minor problem. My form has a lot of layoutcontrolgroups on it, and that is ALL that is restored. In addition, NONE of the properties of the LayoutControlGroups (buttons, expand buttons, etc.) are restored. The code is below and before and after saving\loading pics are attached.
 
1. Is there a better way to save this layout to encourage restoring it exactly as is (recursion?)
2. As a bonus, is there an overload where I can save the XML to a string  instead of a file? I'm happy to create a temporary file if need be, then store the xml data to my database as needed, but I'd rather not. I'd also rather not use a stream because I like being able to read the xml for troubleshooting (great transparancy). 

This is a small example of what we are trying to do.  The call to get the json in our real application returns the json as a stream and there will be a lag between actual full objects returned. In the sample it would be as if the first person object arrived in 2 seconds, the second person object is returned 10 seconds later, etc.  Also there may be 1000s of large objects streaming as a chunked post response. 
I need the ui to update as each item comes in.  I need each row to populate immediately, not after all are returned.
If you place a break point in MainWindow.xaml.cs line 23, you will see that I "ADD" the item to the ObservableCollection but if you step over the add, the row does not appear in the table.  The rows only show after all results are received.
Thank you for you help on this issue.

Hi,
Would you guide me on how resize and image before storing it to the database. I am have a library that can resize and image and return it in Image format but my question is how do i intercept the uploaded image, resize it and then pass it forward to the database in context of XPO / XAF.
Below logic is what I thought off. Do you think it is alright to do it like this?
 

Hello, I have to develop a small Windows App running on Android, you indicate some component of the DevExpress palette, or indicate some App that emulates Windows for this. 

I'm using the GalleryControl to show images, along with the HoverImage properties to let users see larger versions of the images when they mouseover.
The cool thing about the default thumbnail view is that i can set the layout so the whole image is shown, and not distorted:
But when the user mouses over a thumbnail to see a larger version, that larger version is stretched and distorted. Is there any way I can set the HoverImage properties so the larger version is not twisted to match the dimensions of the frame?
Thanks!  

I have 2 grids. Grid A contains a list of counties grouped by region and county (2 levels of grouping). The user can select multiple counties from Grid A using Checkboxes. He then clicks an "Add" button and the selected counties get added to Grid B. After Grid B is updated, 
 that were just added to Grid B.
More Info:
On initial page load, a DataTable is created. That is where the data for Grid B is stored.
The "Add" button click event adds the selected items from Grid A and then rebinds Grid B to the DataTable.
 

1) Run the Treelist Demo
2) Select "Excel Style Filtering Demo"
3) Clear the filter that is enabled by default
4) Edit a few "Modification" cells so that the column contains blank values
5) Invoke the column filter on the "Modification" column, and switch to the "Values" tab
6) Select "Blanks" and  "2.0L H4 5M" filter values, note that the appropriate filter is used
7) Unselect "Blanks and note that the IsNull filter clause is not removed and that the blanks are still shown
See the attached image that shows "Blanks" unchecked  but the report still filtering by blanks

In my GridView, I cannot get all the detail buttons to show enabled.  
I have 2 child tables (Child and OtherChild) linked to the parent table (Parent), and I have rows in all three tables.  The detail buttons only enable when there are rows in the first child table.
In my example, row 3 (Cherry) only has child rows in the OtherChild table, and the detail button in the GridView shows as disabled.  When I click on it, it shows the rows in the linked rows in the OtherChild table.
Run my sample app.  The detail buttons enabled/disabled states are:
Row 1: Apple         Enabled    OK
Row 2: Banana      Enabled    OK
Row 3: Cherry        Disabled   Wrong  should be Enabled
Row 4: Durian        Disabled    OK
Row 5: Egg Plant   Enabled    OK

Hi,
We've just upgraded our application from DevExpress 15.2 to 17.2.4. We're still using the 
 in our MVC application, but since the upgrade it seems it doesn't allow linebreaks anymore in the Appointment.Subject. We get the Javascript error 'Invalid or unexpected token" (see screenshot). We didn't change our code at this point during the upgrade. 
We use a StringBuilder in VB.NET to create the subject string and use StringBuilder.AppendLine to create the linebreaks.
In the Appointment.Description linebreaks are still allowed, but we want it also in our appointment.subjects.I already tried several things, but it doesn't work
Can you help us out?

In other words: How can I integrate my existing web-service-project to the XAF-Websolution. Can you provide any ideas, what could be the best approach and give me some links?
thx a lot
Michael

Hi,
I am using the XtraBar   BarSubItem to dynamically create a Itemlinks to allow the user to select an item (in this case a letter for printing) . 
  ..
Me.mnuSendLetter = New DevExpress.XtraBars.BarSubItem()
.. 
..
 .mnuSendLetter.ItemLinks.Clear()
For Each fi As IO.FileInfo In pFileArray
    Dim ContactBarItem As DevExpress.XtraBars.BarButtonItem = New DevExpress.XtraBars.BarButtonItem
    ContactBarItem.Caption = fi.Name.Substring(9, fi.Name.Length - 13)
    ContactBarItem.Glyph = cManager.My.Resources.Resources.document_pencil_16
    Me.mnuSendLetter.AddItem(ContactBarItem)
 
      AddHandler ContactBarItem.ItemClick, AddressOf mnuSendLetter_ItemClick
Next
When there are a lot of letters to select from , it's tedious for users to scroll through the list. How can I add a autocomplete box or a search box at the top of the list so that users can quickly select the letter they need?
Many Thanks

I am Exporting Multirow Header  in excel sheet  with back color How I will do it
I userd this code for 





I like to conditionally change the appearance of the total summary in the devextreme datagrid. 
As an example I like to display the value of a total summary in Red if the value is negative or in black if its positive.
Is that possible and if how?



Other similar error:
The "scroll to top" also happens on the Tab Panel
Open it on the preview in the windowed mode then scroll to the botton, then click on the last visible "More space", it will scroll to the top as well.
Thank you

Good morning,
 
I am developing my application using XAF. In my web application I created a custom view where I use a BootstrapChart, in this chart I would like to display my data and, when hovering over the bar of my chart, I would like to display a little bit more data other than just the value (such as the name).
An even better alternative for me could be that of dividing the bars in two different groups (one with the bars that are called SQL and one with the bars that are called Cobol). 
The ultimate thing would be that of being able to do both things.
Bellow is my markup to better understand:
Thanks, 
Pablo.



Hi there,
I've been trying to find a good solution to track object changes made by the end-user by using the controls on a view. Sadly all solutions  that came to my mind are not sufficient.
A little bit of a background for a better understanding of my request.
Let's assume we're trying to make an invoice for one of our customers. Usually we're agree on terms before hand and the customer pays amount x for every product p he's purchasing.
So we have a  line item in our invoice saying:
Quantity = 2 | Price per item = 10 | Price = 20 (calculated by PersistentAlias)
One of the features in the app is that the price per item is automatically refreshed when the agreement changes (for all line items not yet billed).
So normally the price per item is not allowed to be edited if an agreement was made. But sometimes individual invoices require manual changes to the price per item property. In this case a bool property (Browsable(false)) is set, that the line item was manipulated and should not automatically refresh again (see changing the agreement).
Forward to my problem:
How can I track the user making changes to the control bound to the price per item property?
What I've tried:
 - Logic in the property set-Method => not working because the automatic algorithm is using that one too
 - A ViewController like in 
 => not working because user may customize the layout of another view which links the line item and the view controller isn't activated for this view
 - Using a custom property editor => may not be the best solution, because the editor can be accidentally switched for a certain view and may not be active in ListEditors other than GridList
What I'm looking for is a generic solution like a MVVM pattern would give me. Have a clear shot at where the property was edited from.
I don't want to add another Browsable(false) property to my object which is only used from code and a visible property which is used for the end-user. In addition I want to edit the value directly in my let's say TextEdit and not showing an dialog via an action to control the change.
This is a feature that really is lacking in XAF. For me there is not a clear possibility to implement logic decoupled from the ui and from model.
Most logic is implemented directly in the XPObjects, so I can't reuse them in another app.
Thanks for any feedback and greetings
Daniel
  

Hi,
I have some problems with DevExpress.XtraTreeList.TreeList.
I have created (inside AutoDesk Inventor) a pannel containing a TreeList.
When i iterate the collection nodes of my TreeList, .net throw this exception: "Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute".
This is strange because this exception  is thrown by only one of my clients (the iteration works right on all other pc of my clients)! 
Can you help me to understand where is the problem? Thanks a lot .

Hi,
since the introduction of the new scrollbar I have some issues  with TcxGrid and TcxScheduler.
At TcxGrid the scrollbar avoids the cellclick. At TcxScheduler there is a very strange behavior with the more events button. I have to wait until I can click it, otherwise a click on the scrollbar will be performed and the scheduler scolls far away from my desired event.
Please see the screenshots.

Just one thing, I noticed that by adding this property the tree is expanded by default and that if I collapse a node all the other closed nodes open. Is it supposed to do that?

I created a codepen with the example : 
 
 When I edit a field and then press the TAB button that goes to the next field, as soon as I type, the focus is lost.
At every valuechanged I need to update the datasource and I used this instruction:
                                var changed = function (e)
                                 {
                                     options.data.Valore = e.value;
                                 };
but as soon as I update the datasource I lose the focus of the field.
How can I solve the problem?
 

Hi,
I have implemented a custom store with Angular 5 (Typescript) but now we need to pre-filter the data before displaying it. I have already tried to filter it at my backend at the  load function of my custom store but this does not work. I also tried the solution 
 but this is also not working.
Please provide my a plunker example where you have a custom store with an prefilter in Angular 5.

Hello,
I try to explain a simplified the situation:
I have a Form with a TextEdit control ..
And a main RibbonControl with menu and other buttons ...
If I edit a value on TextEdit and confirm with Enter Key or Tab, every thing works fine.
And a calculation is done ...
If a click on Ribbon before to leave the TextEdit the sequence event is
Ribbon.Click
TextEdit.Leave
But this is not good for me because the Edited Value is not confirmed and the calculation start with a not updated value.
is there a convinient way like to make TextEdit.Leave before Ribbon.Click?
other suggestions?
Thankyou

I get this error when I try to render Devextreme controls in my Asp.Core application. 
Initially when I tried to setup Devextreme, I got some errors which I got resolved by following the instructions here: 
I was able to get the devextreme controls to work but few days later when I ran the project, I started seeing errors in my browser console (See the image attached)
I'm attaching the sample project which has Devextreme configured. The page where the controls exist can be found at this location : /Areas/Agency/Views/Dashboard/Index
Please help me resolve these errors.

Do you have any plans to support Fabric UI theme? 
I know that there is ThemeBuilder but it would be great if we can have it out of the box.


Thanks.. That got me started.. 
The one I have in mind is similar to: 
I've added some of that logic.. 
A few changes
1) The row with the Bed Episode ID of 9924, I would like to have a white background.  
Thanks.. That really got me started...
Let me know if any errors occur so that I can send you updated data,,,  I see that the BedEpisodes are not displaying the DB sent. Let me know if these are a must... Had to change the private data, thus the issue...

2) Since these are 2 different Facility Types I'd like to have a sum for each one of them... (there could be multiples of the same Facility Types, to which, the sum would be needed)
5)  I think it's showing the Sum of the entire group and I will also need separate sums for each FacilityType (See 2 above)

Do you have a simple example how to create a mind map in the Diagram Control from data in a sql table? Can it be a self-referencing table? How is that different from the tree view approach? I find the demo center a bit difficult to dissect. 

We are using PivotGrid control and below is my xaml which I defined.
XAML:
<dxpg:PivotGridControl Grid.Row="1" x:Name="MainPivotGrid"
                             CustomCellDisplayText="MainPivotGrid_CustomCellDisplayText" >
        private void MainPivotGrid_CustomCellDisplayText(object sender, PivotCellDisplayTextEventArgs e)
        {
            try
            {
                var pivotGridDataSource = PivotGridControl.GetData(MainPivotGrid).PivotDataSource;
                PivotGridNativeDataSource ds = pivotGridDataSource as PivotGridNativeDataSource;
                var dataController = ds.DataController;
            }
          
        }
We are using dataController in order to get ExpressionEvaluator as below. 
ExpressionEvaluator evaluator = dataController.CreateExpressionEvaluator(filter, true, out evaluatorCreateException);        
But when we upgraded to 17.1, we are getting  dataController as null but it was working in 15.1.
Can you please let me know, how do we get ExpressionEvaluator from PivotGridControl inside a CustomCellDisplayText event handler?
   

Good day,
I have added an "add" icon to the column in the Datagrid on onCellPrepared

Now I want to change the color of the icon acordingly some setting.
i.e. icon green for adding or red for removing the data.
How can I accomplish this task for colloring the icon?
Please advice.

Hi,
I am using your MVC Dashboard, and in the dashboard I have a Grid and a Bubble Map Item.  I enabled Cross-Data-Source-Filtering in the Grid, so when I click a row in the grid, the Bubbles on the map gets updated.
However, if the map is zoomed to England for example, and then I click a row in the grid, for which the coordinates are in Denmark, then the map is not set and zoomed automatically to Denmark, and the end-user would have to manually zoom out and zoom in to Denmark in order to see the bubbles in Denmark map.
Is there any way to make this automatic? 
Best regards,
Fadi 

Hello,
if grid is grouped on one column it is then sorted  as well. This is clear and as 
 says they are inseparable. My complaint is that option remove sorting should be removed in this case. It is confusing in this way where it also removes grouping on column.

Hi,
I invoke a PopupMenu when I right click on a node. I would like to change the caption of a subitem's button at runtime when I click on it.
My PopupMenu has the following structure:
Button
Subitem -->  Button
                       Off
I need to change the caption of the button "Off" in "On" when I click on it.
I can do it for the "first level" of the popup menu but I don't know how to change the caption for the buttons inside the subitem. 
Attached you find a sample.
Cordially,

Hello,
using all the great new features in versions 17.2.x of Winforms controls, I am currently making our desktop application DPI-aware. Our app behaves well in many different DPI scenarios in Windows 10. However, I realized some misbehavior when running the app on a Remote Desktop session on Windows Server 2016 or 2012. This does not happen if the RDP session runs on a Windows 10 host.
For demonstration purposes, I used your  Ribbon form template and made it DPI aware by adding a manifest file. 
When running the demo locally on Windows 10 (Surface pro 4 with 200% display scaling), everything is fine.
When running the demo in a RDP session hosted by another Windows 10 computer, it's also fine (see first screenshot). 
When running the demo in a RDP session hosted by Windows Server 2012 or 2016, the default skin font size is not scaled which results in unreadable text. Conventional Winforms controls are not affected.
Could you give me some advice about this or do you know a workaround? It is essential for us to host our application in a professional Remote desktop environment using High DPI settings.
 
Thanks in advance.

Hi guys,
I want to pass some additional information along with  the files I upload; normally I'd use customArgs on the begin callback  but I note that the MVC UploadControl doesn't have a begin callback and  the 'FilesUploadStart' event's 'e' property does not contain a  customArgs property.
While searching your help forums I found this: 
 which says it can't be done directly and one needs to use an ASPxHiddenField control; but I cannot find any reference to this within the mvc framework versions (I also not it is in the ASP demos but not in the MVC set).
So, do I need to use the HiddenField control; and if so how? Or is there another way I can send additional data along with the file upload?
Thank you,
Stan

Hi , 
I Have added new grid column to grid control 
 Dim Newcol As New DevExpress.XtraGrid.Columns.GridColumn
Then I have declare one RepositoryItemLookupEdit  to populate my dataset column 
and when i run the code  i was able to select the item from grid control but when i have move mouse from that cell it vanishes.  Please provide sample for the same version 15.1.
 
Also please let me know how can i get the selected items ID?
 

Does the devexpress provide any tools to help with usage tips? e.g. presenting popups to the user with useful hints on how to get the most from a specific element of the UI they have accessed?
These are usually provided in GUIs with a cycling set of hints on how to use specific screens, but which can be dismissed if the user prefers. They can of course be relatively easily created using standard popups, I was just wondering if devex has a skinned control for this purpose?
 

I have a GridView and a Toolbar. in the toolbar there is a button to Add rows.
The GridView is in InLineEdit mode and NewItemRowPosition is set to Bottom.
How can I bring the new line automatically on the screen? In other words how can I jump automatically (scrolldown) to the new (last) row?
In the attached picture the Grid is adding a new row but the user can't see it untill he scrolls down.
 

I'm having trouble converting a mouse pointer location to a pdf textbox location in a pdf viewer.
I know i'm close... BUT
Here is my code... when i let go of the mouse button, i want to get the location and create a textbox at that location.
I'm using the pdfdocumentprocess and viewer in tandem to attempt this.  But Cursor points to PDF points not working correctly
I've tried different ways... but the text box either doesn't show up at all OR the textbox shows up in a different place.  Cursor Position is NOT equaling the pdf position.
Thanks very much for any help!

Hello!
I'm using your WPF control suite together with the docking-solution from actipro  (
)
In my vb.net project I have a serious issue.
I have two actipro document tabs. I'd like to activate the second from within a RowDoubleklick Event of a DXGrid.on the first tab.
If the grid has set
everything works perfect. But if I set 
the tab will not be activated.
I have to set Row-Style in my UI because I do not want the editmode. Also if I set the Navigation style to Cell and disable editing the DoubleClick does not work.
In my opinion this is an issue coming from DevExpress. What do you think about?
In the attachment you find a Vs2017 sample solution   with three tabs. One tab that should be activated, one with a grid with Navigationstyle Row an one with cell. On both you see a standanrd button that activates the inactive tab, too.
Can you reproduce  the issue? Do you allready know this Problem? Do you know a solution?
It would be great if you could help me !
If you have any further questions please let me know.

Hi, 
I am trying to hide the items of a grouped menu items in a dxSlideout, however, the group header would still remain. 
How can I hide the header as well, please?
Thanks.

Clicking on options such as 'Design in Report Wizard' (definitely happens), Field List (sometimes) and others causes a different window to be highlighted.
For instance, whilst filling this report flicking back to our application and selecting  "Design in Report Wizard" causes the browser to be re-opened rather than the wizard.  Other times it's our main application from where the designer is launched - so it seems to potentially open the previously active window rather than the expected window.
We do run the designer in a separate Thread, so it could be that it only does it under these circumstances. 

Hello DevExpress Team, 
I am using a TreeView as a content template for a dropdown box. 
To make the TreeView update its content automatically depending on the selection of another dropdown box 
I bound the datasource of the TreeView to a knockout observable. 
My code works so far as the observable is updated, but the TreeView shown in the dropdown box is not. 
What are possible issues causing this problem or are there any alternatives to knockout observables?
Thanks in advance.
Sincerely 
Hendrik 
 

Using an object datasource that has complex objects within it in the fields list, double clicking the ">" (expand) on an object with the base object causes a complete lock up.  Memory does not increase, but the designer is in some kind of code loop from which it is not released.
Single click to open then close multiple times seems to work, as long as the object property tree has already opened/closed.  Would suggest thread/timing issue.
We do run the designer in a separate thread, in case this may be the trigger for the issue. 

Dear Support Team,

How do i show the marker with location in map?

Hi, 
I have a parent container which has two controls inside it I want a splitter to split these two controls panels for that currently I am using DevExpress.XtraEditors.SplitterControl() class object which only provides options to dock this splitter on Right, Left, Top and Bottom of the parent container. If I am giving Right to Docking style, splitter gets stick to the right edge of the parent pane and the right control gets invisible. I want splitter to be in between both the child control panel or we can say in the middle of the parent container. 
Thanks,

Hello!
I need to prevent the user from selecting certain values (these items have tag=1) online.
I could not find an event like CheckStateChanged.
P.s. These items must behave like  radioButton. If the user checks the second item, when the first is checked, the first checkState must be unchecked. I will remind, it concerns only those items at which the tag is equal '1'.
Thank you! 

In new version something happened with loolups. We use Get text function on dataset to change text to user friendly.
eg. 
"This year %yyyy% " => "This year (2018) "
"Next year %yyyy+1% " => "Next year (2019) "
Unfortunately after upgrade components we received reports about not formatted values are displayed in lookups. If you dropdown edit then correct value is in list but ones you select some wrong one is in present in edit.
See my sample project compiled with 16.2.5 (correct)  and 17.2.4 (wrong)

you described in this ticket, on how to add an export action to the actions in a listview. 
but is it somehow possible to access the dashbaord export options as well?
would be nice, if you could provide a small example.

Hi,
I have a problem with the "format" option of a dxDataGrid.
In a multilingual context, I can not dynamically pass neither the value "currency" nor the value "precision", because they are different for each row of the table.
At this point I managed the currency in the option "calculateCellValue", with the "formatter" of "Globalize". But when I go to exprtare the data in an excel file, these come back as strings, while I would need to read them as numbers.
Could you help me to understand how to implement the "format" option passing dynamically both the "currency" and the "precision" option?
Best regards.
 

Greetings,
I recently updated to the latest build of your VCL components.
My users are now notifying me that when you open the scheduler for the first time the reminder screen is displayed briefly and then disappears behind the scheduler.  If you move the scheduler  to access the reminder dialog it is not there.
If you close the scheduler, then open it again, this time the reminded it partially in view, but behind the main form.  You cannot click on it to access it and therefore have no ability to dismiss or snooze any of the reminders.
I have a 34mb Mpeg available to show this if you would like to see it.

Hello,
I'm using DevExtreme.AspNet.Data package (version 1.3.0) to transform data on server before sending it to dxDataGrid on frontend.
Currently I need to implement custom summary type for string columns and the problem is that DevExtreme.AspNet.Data does not support custom aggregators.
I've looked at library sources and found that summary types are hardcoded although there is an internal abstract class Aggregator. 
I've also found the same question on github: 
Do you plan to support custom aggregators in DevExtreme.AspNet.Data and when?

Hi,
I have a Devextreme Datagrid using popup editor in my project.  I used columns and then forms item group  to arrange the layout.  I have arranged my controls as follows;
item#1 - Textbox but disabled
 item#2 - Lookup control
 item#3 - Lookup control
 item#4 - Lookup control
 item#5 - Textbox but enabled
etc, etc.... 
When i clicked edit or add(+)  button , I need to press tab in keyboard so the first enabled item (item#2 lookup) will have the focus.
 Can someone help me so that when the edit page loaded it will automatically focus on the first enabled control which is the lookup control.
I tried also this code in OnEditorPrepared  >>>>   e.component.focus(e.component.getCellElement(rowindex, <columntofiocus>))
but no luck.
I attached  my .cshtml file so you can check.
Thanks,
Simon 


as you can see in my question i set the SettingsHeaderFilter.Mode
but that doesnt work because he shows header filter list without ranges.
that due the problem that we only set the displaytekst in your answer .
this happens in the page.init handler



Hello,
please can you help me with a query. I am struggling to understand why this is happening or what I am doing wrong.
I have included a sample project for your attention which demonstrates the error. 
The scenario is, while I am creating an order I would like to add a dependant to a member. Now I realise I could just create a new dependant using the lookupeditor of the dependant property on the order, but in my real world project this is not possible so please bear with me.
I have created a viewcontroller with a popup action that opens the member detailview where I can create a new dependant, but it seems that during the save of the member object it is also creating a null member object which is why the firstname validation is failing. if you debug the code you will see this object being created.
The steps to show this error are
1. run the application and create a member without dependants.
2. run the order screen create a new order and select the existing member, and click on the view controller "add dependant"
3. the member screen opens correctly. 
4. enter a dependant on the member and save the member
5. you will see if fails with the first name being empty
6. this error is not from the current member object but this phantom null member object which is being created at the same time.
Please let me know if this is a bug or if there is another way to do this, or what needs changing,
thank you 

Hi,
I am updating my code that draws custom button in a colu mn's header.
I am using RepositoryItemButtonEdit with 
RepositoryItemButtonEdit.Buttons[0].Kind = ButtonPredefines.Plus;
or 
RepositoryItemButtonEdit.Buttons[0].Kind = ButtonPredefines.Minus;
Code is subscribed to CustomDrawColumnHeader event.
In order to adjust caption's rectangular i need to know button's dimensions.
In runtime RepositoryItemButtonEdit.Buttons[0].Image is null and other characteristics such as Width and Height are unavailable.
How do I get  button's dimensions?

Is there anyway to have a LayoutControl where the Layout Groups wrap?
Basically  we have a reading pane that can be resized. We usually show the data in two columns using your layout control, layout groups and layout items. But depending on the space, it would be good if these Layout Groups could wrap into a single column?
How might we be able to go about this. This issue has mainly come up because we usually support 1920 x 1080 resolution for some of users are using Microsoft Surfaces now and by default that runs at %200 dpi which effectively reduces horizontal space by like 40%. So mainly to get that back it would be good if we could get this scenario working somehow.

See attached project (from which you can see that I selected wrong IDE when creating this ticket. Correct IDE is Delphi 10.2).
When running this project and opening  a PDF, the code in the ShowFindPanel event should set the search to a case-sensitive, whole-word search for the term "search text". But when the panel opens, only the two first parameters actually happen. As can be seen from the settings dropdown in the panel, the setting of these booleans manifests in the UI, but not the search text change. 

I have attached a sample that contains a dummy select Statement with 3 lines.
The report shows a table with 3 columns:
- a number
- a Picture (the property Keep Together=true)
- and a rich text 
If the rich text contains text that exceeds the length of a page, the picture is split although pictures property "Keep Together" is set to true.
Do you know how I can tell the report to show pictures together?
 

Hello!
I have buttons which are in a callback panel. These buttons are disabled by default but can become enabled (with button "Enable" in attached project). 
The problem is as following: when I perform a callback of the callback panel  (with button "Callback" in attached project), we can see a flash of the color of the button. But the button is always disabled after a callback (ClientEnabled = false), so it would be always grey.
In the attached zip file, there are a sample and a video which demonstrate the problem.
So, how is it possible to prevent this flash after a callback?
Thanks for your help !
Best regards!

Dear Support Team,
Recently we started a new MVC project intended for internal use.
Because we started to use DevExtreme in our 'Onview' webapplication, we desided to make full use of Devextreme in this internal webproject.
So we started this project as an DevExtreme MVC5 application.
Now the basics are in, and we started to implement reports.
We used: 
 
And when we run this, we get Error E0024. (Occurs if a DevExtreme bundle is linked more than once on a single page).
Also, when we place the next code in _Layout.cshtml we also get this error:
So when we use DevExpress in combo with DevExtreme, we always get this error???
Maybe we must just start over with a regular MVC project, and add DevExpress Scripts.
Then we can also use the DevExtreme widgets, because that's how we do it now in our commercial application.
What route should we take?
Best Regards,
John van de Pol



I have a unique field, when I remove the files from the application level, and then trying to re-set the deleted record, I get a message that the rokord already exists! 



I have attached a sample that contains a dummy select Statement with 3 lines.
The report shows a detail part (property "Keep Together" is set to true)
containing a table with 2 columns (a number and a richt text )
and a Group Header for that table with property "Repeat every page" is set to true.
If the text shown in rich text element exceeds the lenght of a page, the Group Header is printed on the first page without any contents of the Detail band.
Is there any property that should be set to prevent this behaviour?

Hello
from your example treeListDemo\dynamicNodeLoading, I just set the Theme to TouchlineDark
when I use a Microsoft Surface in touch mode:
- it's very hard to open a directory node (with double touch down)
- it's quite difficult to select a node (also double click)
I would like to modify the way this control is working:
when user touch a node, the node must be selected or be expanded.
So I need to add code inside TouchDown event.
here is my problem:
I need to get a TreeListNode from the event
and i don't succeed.
  



Do you have a solution?

In picture 'discrete.jpg' only the labels with a value are shown. That`s exactly what I am trying to achieve, except from one thing.
The problem is all segments between the ticks have the same size, while the datetime interval varies. The perception of time get's lost.
If the argumentType is set to 'continuous', the spacing between ticks is correct, but it is almost impossible to only display the ticks with a value. 
I have tried this by using the customizeText propery and setting the tickInterval and axisDivisionFactor to a very low value.
The problem then is, besides the much longer calculation time, not all labels are shown because empty labels overlap with non-empty labels resulting in no label at all.
If overlappingBehavior is set to 'none', all labels are shown but labels can overlap with nearby labels.
'continuous.jpg' is the result I want, but it would be nice if the labels didn't overlap and the calculation time didn't explode because of the low tickInterval.
Is this combination of showing discrete values in a continuous way possible, or is it possible to implement this as a feature

Hi,
we have a large TreeList with lots of nodes and a wide column. Typically the tree is made smaller by the user so its column will not be fully visible.
(See screenshots attached)
There's an action that needs to find a node and make it the focused node, it should be visible to the user as well. Ideally the node is centered within the trees area. In my example the node is almost invisible because the node is on e deeper nesting level and its text is drawn outside the trees visible area.
 I managed to center the focused node vertically, but I need some ideas on how to make the focused node visible horizontally.
 As you can see in the screenshots, a possible way could be to scroll in such a way that the expand button "+" is centered horizontally in the tree's width.
How can I do this programmatically?
Thanks in advance,
Walter

I am unsure on how to set the fields in a Filter builder for an Ienumerable datafield's sub properties. I understand we can use the "Allow Hierarchical" if the datafield is not an IEnumerable.
Below is a sample code, where I am trying to filter the "Products" datamember in the ViewModel, by its name!!
  @(Html.DevExtreme().FilterBuilder<PageViewModel>()
                .AllowHierarchicalFields(true)
                .Fields(fields =>
                {
fields.AddFor(m => m.Products.First<ProductModel>().ProductName)
                            .Lookup(l => l.DataSource(Model.Products.Select(s => s.Name)));
})
)
I understand this is wrong, but could you guide me on how to set it right? Also, the results of this datasource I am populating to a dxlist.

The vertical code analysis bar on the right of the coding area is missing. This is the CR bar that would have markers for issues, and you could hover over the marker to see the issue and suggestions for fixes.  I use that a LOT, and now it's gone!

Hi,
I'm having trouble converting my project from version 15.1.4 to 17.2.5.
I have used the Project  Converter but got errors executing the application.

If you need any more information about what I am using, please let me know.
Otherwise some complete instructions about doing the whole upgrade from the beginning to the end would be appreciated.

Hi,
I am having some difficulty trying to get a lookupedit box to act like I would like. Currently we use Autocomplete filtering to limit the list when they type and this works well. However we would like the user to be able to type things not found in the list and use that text instead. Unfortunately, the autocomplete seems to not allow characters to be entered that are not found in the list. Is there a way to keep the current autocomplete filtering dropdown lookupedit while still allowing users to type a custom value? 

Hello XAF Team,
I have a problem about XAF ASP.Net Project, 
I have aggregated Master Detail object relation. Activated Nested ListView Inline Edit  mode.
When I open a new Master record ( called DemandDocument ) filling some dummy data to master. After that adding a new detail record ( called DemandItem ) to this Master object. 
Clicking Master's Save action,  committing this 2 object ( I observed from a controller ObjectSpace_Committing event ) successfully completed.
But inline update action still exists, so when leaving to another NavigationItem, browser pop's up Unsaved Confirmation Dialog box.
You can see from attached images. 
My question is that, 
How to execute this nested listview's inline update command action when I click Master Object's Save action.
I tried GridView's UpdateEdit method in Committing -> not worked. ( Visually worked but browser asked again )
I tried to Suppress unsaved confirmation -> not worked  (

Hi,
Since updating our product from 17.2.3 to 17.2.5 , the export behaviour crash when the customArgs that must be sent to the server is too complex.
 -Create a gridview that handles client-side exports
- add a "BeginCallback" client handler
- in that callback, add a big chunk of data in event.customArgs (an 18k character serialized json in our case)
- then on the website, call the client-side "exportTo" method.
- the export callback is called, a file is generated and downloaded by the client
- the export callback is called but crash, with the following message : "HTTP Error 414. The request URL is too long.". 
It appears that customArgs are encoded in the form action and therefore have the same restrictions as all GET queries (including max query length). Should'nt it be encoded in the form directly ? It would not have any size restriction and should be easy to implement ("just" dynamically add one hidden input in the export form for each keys in the customArgs). This is what we had in our code while the export did not trigger the BeginCallback event directly (one of bug corrections in either 17.2.4 or 17.2.5) and it worked quite well.
The "culprit' line in DX Javascript code :
Is there a way to handle that case elegantly ?
Kind regards,
Jean-Christophe Chalt?

Hi,
Is there a way to open and access the full Dashboard Data Source Wizard, say at the click of a simple button on a form? 
i.e. all pages going from Data source type -> Connection Parameters ->  Query Builder -> Parameters -> Finish
I've seen that you can create a SqlDataSource and open either the query builder, or connection parameters screens individually using various methods. However I want to be able to run the full wizard and create my data source (SqlDataSource or ExcelDataSource) based on the results. Is this possible?
Apologies if a similar question has already  been answered, but I haven't been able to find it.
Kind Regards,

Hi
I'm trying to increase the size of the row indicator programatically depending on the size of the row number so that the use sees the whole row number in the gridview.  The code below is working fine except that the row indicator only increases in size when I click on the row indicator with a mouse click.  Is there anyway that I can get it to increase in size automatically without having to click on it.  I've tried grid refresh and gridview.refresh, but neither seem to work.
 

Hello,
In a pivot, I use a DateRecolte field in the row area. I display the week of the year of this Date and I would like to be able to sort on the value Date and not on the value week. Which is illogical, because 2017-12-29 (week 52) is before 2018-01-13 (week 2) if we sort ascending this field. So 52 is before 2 and not the other way around.
Do you have workaround for this problem.
See image.
 

Dear DevExtreme Team,
we are using dxDataGrid with enabled group-panel in an angular5 application. We have our own backend attached (which does all the sorting / filtering) of the data and therefor use a CustomStore which maps your LoadOptions onto our QueryParameters object.
All of this works very nicely!
Now we have the following issue:
- When dragging one column to the group columns, everything is grouped nicely
- Now when collapsing one of the groups inside the grid, the LoadOptions get a filter for "<>" (not equal) for this specific group, so that this group is no longer returned => also this works nice
- When finally changing the sorting of the group column, things go bad:
=> We now receive multiple load calls in the CustomStore. Some of the calls don't have filters set, some don't have sortings set
It feels like that the grid throws multiple events when partially filled LoadOptions.
 Please see the attached screenshot. This is a "console.log(loadOptions);" in the load method of the store.
All three logs have been dispatched by a single click on re-sorting the group column.
Also you can see from the screenshot, that one of the LoadOptions tries to filter ">" (GreaterThan) on a string value which is obviously not possible and results in a server-side error for us. 
Thanks for any help on this topic!

Hello,
My use case is to convert a CSV file to a TXT file, converting various values in between.  The CSV's format is: Integer, Date, Integer; converting the integer executes fine, but the date value from the source file is trickier.
I load the worksheet like so:
The conversion function executes one part rather quickly
But this part is crazy slow
I'm thinking that maybe during the first conversion I can build a datacolumn, and just append the column to the worksheet. is that possible/reasonable? Or is there a way to just create a column of a certain length with all the same values?

Hi, was poking around looking in the standalone Dashboard Designer - wondering if it's possible to add additional (text) header rows as shown in the image I attached to this ticket.
The business group presented an excel file showing how they'd like their columns arranged, and they have additional colored "grouping" headers above the cell columns - I wanted to be sure if this was possible, or not, with the Dashboard Designer?
Thanks!

See attached example including 2 jpegs. 1 showing the open password error, the other showing the decryption error.
I have an existing HTML "Test.html" located in the bin debug folder.
I load it into the RichEditDocumentServer , set some defaults, convert it to PDF 1.7 via setting encryption, which requires me to set a permissions password. Well this password is sometimes randomly becoming the PDF open password.
Also, randomly, I'll get an error upon opening the pdf that says " There was an error opening this document. Acrobat cannot decrypt this document."
I've written a test program for you. It loops on read console if nothing is entered.  I have been able to duplicate both errors with this test program.

These do not help me.. 
I have a main report - Daily note
On it, I have several subreports that need to populate if there is data in the subreports
1. Order Subreport
2. Results Subreport
3. addendum subreport
If the detail of the subreport is empty, then I do not want to have it Print ANYTHING.  No labels etc that are on the report.  I also want the space the subreport occupies to shrink and disappear.  All fields below the box on the main report to slide up.  
I see many articles but no solutions on how to do this..
Please help.
 The attachment shows: 
Results: BIG SPACE   
Order: BIG SPACE
Addendum Note: BIG SPACE.
None of these and the space should not be there.. 

Please refer to the attached screen shot.  My Customer Notes tab is highlighted in red to bring users' attention to the fact that they need to read these notes.  Similarly, the buttons are color coded; for example, Case Folder is green to indicate a case folder exists on the filesystem.
Is it possible to not hit the user over the head quite so hard with Customer Notes - can I place a similar border as the buttons?

I have a column that displays an image. I created a repositoryItemPictureEdit1 attached to it and put the property MaskType = Circle, but it does not work in tileview.

Hi,
Some users get the below error on best fit of the pivot grid. Why is this happening and how do we resolve? Thanks

How can I add an OK button to a BootstrapPopup control as shown in the attached screenshot.
I want the OK button to close the popup when it is clicked. 

I have a ASPxDateEdit set up like this:
<dx:ASPxDateEdit ID="dateEdit" runat="server" EditFormat="Custom" Date="2009-11-02 09:23" Width="190" Caption="ASPxDateEdit">
    <TimeSectionProperties Adaptive="true">
        <TimeEditProperties EditFormatString="hh:mm tt" />
    </TimeSectionProperties>
    <CalendarProperties>
        <FastNavProperties DisplayMode="Inline" />
    </CalendarProperties>
</dx:ASPxDateEdit>
On Page load I do this:
  dateEdit.TimeSectionProperties.Visible = true;
  dateEdit.UseMaskBehavior = true;
  dateEdit.EditFormatString = "dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm tt"; 
  dateEdit.DisplayFormatString = "dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm tt";  
        
When I enter a date of 02/28/2012 it looks like this 02/02/8201. 
This happens on your web site as well. :
 
Why?  Can you tell me why your demo web page behaves this way or way y code copied from the web page does?
Thanks you.

Hi Guys, 
We need to adapt the Responsive web template in order to respect some internal guidelines.
I think all changes will be matter of changing css styles without touching the html template layout.
How can we edit the CSS? 
Is there any theme customizer tool?

Hi,
i want to open dashboard developed with your ASP.NET Core Dashboard from a specific url like this
is ther a way to configure this?
Thanks 

I didn't find answer for simple solution if it is possible to accomplish.
Simple model:
  public class TestModel
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Customer { get; set; }
        public string Country { get; set; }
        public List<Program> Program { get; set; }
    }
Need to bind Program in GridView (not in edit mode) from model, not executing look up table for each row.
Test project has implementation for binding from look  up value but there is problem with filtering - if it is combobox or list box - filter doesn't recognize values in column, if it is custom displaying - it could be filtered by group of values (ex. Description 1 1, Description 1 2, Description 1 3).
Is there anyway link column strait to the model and filter by it?
Thank you.
 

Hello,
I have seen there is a new patch available for Tokyo 10.2.2.
Do we need a new version or to recompile the existing components before we can  use them ?

I  need to be able to calculate quartile information for a specific group in the reporting suite. For example in group 1, I need to show quartile1, 2, 3, and 4. Is this possible using your suite with regards to the report builder?
I see we can do this for a spreadsheet such as here: 
 

I'm having a weird issue with the DataItemTemplate and binding to properties on my data source specifically after calling the filter builder.
My grid view is binding via BindToLINQ  to an IQueryable Datasource. Initially the DataBinder.Eval within the template works, however If I use the filter builder button I have enabled in the toolbar and then cancel out of the Filter Builder Window, my DataItemTemplate is missing the DataBinder.Eval data.
An example would be:
  
Initial Grid View render displays the following;
<a href="/Contact/Edit/123">Test Contact</a>
After calling the Filter Builder window the column displays the following;
<a href="/Contact/Edit/">Test Contact</a>
I see that the field is inserting the value my column's FieldName is set to, specifically ContactName however the Databinder does not seem to evaluate the secondary property on my data source, ContactId.
All other interactions with the grid is working correctly such as paging, grouping and sorting. This only occurs after calling the Filter Builder.
 

Hi support, I want to use the codeRush templates, but is not working, even when I set the option in the codeRush setup: 
 

Hello,
I'm using a datagird with record grouping, I need to be able to add a button or a checkbox to the grouping header which allows me to "apply" to both the selected header and the items contained within it.
I'll attach a picture so I can  make myself clearer.
 

I'm experiencing a problem within the dxDatagrid control when a column contains a dxLookup control. This is what happens:
When a new row is initialized within the datagrid, four of the five columns contain a lookup mechanism to suggest choices (once you enter enough characters). On lookup selection, the cell updates, and the grid row functions as intended. However, when the row is saved, the four columns with lookup mechanisms do not display their value; the 5th column (which does not use a lookup control) displays its value appropriately. 
I've used alert() functions to read back each column's value, and the values are present. Though invisible, they are correctly populated.
The invisible behavior continues. When loading the page, and the page model possesses data within the datagrid's datasource, the datagrid is blank (even the 5th column is now invisible). From my debugging, I know that the page model contains data; the datagrid just doesn't display anything. Even more odd, the datagrid suggests there is data as it doesn't display "No data" in the main body of the control.
Here is a code snippet containing the dxDatagrid control:
Here is a breakdown of the screenshots included:
1) dxDatagrid_ColumnsLookups_DataSelected_PriorToRowSave
Shows the page with controls for a new page object. I've used the lookup controls to populate fields and prepare to save the row.
2) dxDatagrid_ColumnsLookups_DataSelected_PostSave
I've saved my new row with all the values selected in the previous photo. You can see only the non-lookup column displays its value.
3) dxDatagrid_ColumnsLookups_ModelSaved_PageLoad
Shows a retrieved object after it was saved with datagrid rows, despite the invisibility issues. The datagrid for this segment of the ViewModel possesses data, even though you can't see it.
4) dxDatagrid_ColumnsWithNoLookups
I performed another page load of another saved model object, but commented out the ".Lookup(...)" attributes from each of the four columns. You can see that the data is visible.
---
What can I do to correct this invisible behavior?
 

Hello guys,
Iam having an issue as "Session Expired"  when 2 users open the same excel file and user1 save it . Then user2 looses the session and get the error "Session Expired  "

I am following the examples in the KB for adding file attachments to my project. It is proving difficult to follow them.
I am failing to see where to add the FileAttachmentBase. I created my table (XPObject), but I can't add the FileAttachmentBase base class since it is already a XPObject base class.
Do you have a sample project with a simple file attachment with the ORM Data Model? 

Hi,
I have a report with a PivotGrid, and one of the fields of the PivotGrid contains multiple words, separated by comma. I am trying to auto resize the row height of the PivotGrid to fit whole words on one line. I almost achieved it, however some of the rows display additional space (please look at the attached screen snapshot), which makes me think my CustomRowHeight code is not entirely correct. Would you please check if it is correct? Is there any other factor that might be interfering? 
Thanks a lot!

 I am facing one problem when I make a filter in a query utilizing TcxDBPivotGrid
When I fire the event DblClick I am realizing a filter to manip ulate a selected row in other screen. When I disable the filter and come back to the grid, I lost the selected row, always that the selected row is after scroll row (for example select the last record).
I am attaching a video and a pro ject with the example about the problem.
I would like to come back to the selected record independently of the grid position. 

I am using your richeditdocument service to translate HTML into RTF.
I create a  new instance of document server and set the RtfText property to the html I'm passing in:
var reds = new RichEditDocumentServer();
reds.RtfText = myHtml;
If the html I pass in does not have any margin setting or style info, then the richedit document server is putting space before and after every paragraph. 
For example, if I pass the html "<p>test</p>", I get the following RTF:
{\rtf1\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0 Calibri;}{\f1 Times New Roman;}}{\colortbl ;}{\*\defchp \f1}{\stylesheet {\ql\f1 Normal;}{\*\cs1\f1 Default Paragraph Font;}{\*\ts2\tsrowd\f1\ql\tscellpaddfl3\tscellpaddl108\tscellpaddfb3\tscellpaddfr3\tscellpaddr108\tscellpaddft3\tsvertalt\cltxlrtb Normal Table;}}{\*\listoverridetable}\nouicompat\splytwnine\htmautsp\sectd\pard\plain\ql\sb240\sa240{\f1\cf0 test}\f1\par}
 Note the \sb240 and \sa240 in the paragraph.
I tried doing the following to remove the spacing before and after the paragraphs:
            var pp = reds.Document.BeginUpdateParagraphs(reds.Document.Range);
            pp.SpacingBefore = 0f;
            pp.SpacingAfter = 0f;
            reds.Document.EndUpdateParagraphs(pp);
The problem is that this always removes spacing from every paragraph, even if my html has paragraph spacing set in a style. 
For instance, the following HTML has a bottom margin of 10 pts on the paragraph
"<body>\r\n\t<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n\t\t.cs40314EBF{text-align:left;text-indent:0pt;margin:0pt 0pt 10pt 0pt;line-height:1.15}\r\n\t\t.cs957795DE{color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;}\r\n\t</style>\r\n\t<p class=\"cs40314EBF\"><span class=\"cs957795DE\">word</span></p><p class=\"cs40314EBF\"><span class=\"cs957795DE\">paste</span></p></body>\r\n"
What I want is to just have the richeditdocumentserver not set any default paragraph spacing but to keep whatever spacing is in the html (and if there is none, don't set any spacing at all or set it to zero). So in the first example above, it would not set any spacing and in the second example, it would  preserve the spacing after (bottom margin) in the html.
Is there a way to do this?

Hi,
I am trying to implement drag  and drop between two grids on the same control using the AllowDragDrop property  in version 17.2.  From what I have read I don't need to use a Drag and Drop Manager.  Both grids are bound to a IList of the same object.  The goal is to have users drag items from on grid that is populated with items to the other grid.  Below is the XAML for the form.
I can drag items within the first grid but when I try to drag them over the second grid I get the circle with the slash in it showing its not allowed.  I have allowed drop enabled on both and I set up a EventToCommand to handle the drop event.  I looked at the examples in the help but they were not geared towards MVVM.
Thanks in advance for your help.

I'm trying to setup a nested grid as in this example: 
However, I'd like to block the user from selecting anything in the child grid. I tried the following with no luck.

When I new up the DocumentPreviewWindow class, the background color for the buttons in my application are changing.  
      DocumentPreviewWindow previewWindow = new DocumentPreviewWindow()
      {
        Owner = Application.Current.MainWindow
      };
Something in that code is overriding global settings.  How can I either fix that or work around it?
Before and after screenshots attached.

Is there any way to highlight the negative area of a sparkline? 
I'd need to indicate to my user once the values turn negative. 
Thanks

I have been cracking my head on a problem that at first seemed trivial. I have a dxList with custom item template in which I display a button. I want to be able to click on that button. The problem is that there is a onItemClick event for that very same dxList so that event gets fired first although I called e.stopPropagation() in my event.
Please look at this CodePen 
 I put together to show you my problem.

i tried to set the cell background fill color and set ALPHA (A) to 10, which means it is very light version of color, and after exiting dialog, i see it did not do this and reverted back to alpha 255.
i think background color is ok, yet needs to be very light (i.e. alpha < 33)

Hey:
I own one current ASP.Net license.  I authorized my associate Wayne Fair to use it and I got a trial subscription which has just expired.  Wayne no longer needs my license.  So I removed him as a licensed User.  Your site says I don't need to register myself as a new user because I am the Owner.  However, I am still getti ng the "EXPIRED" dialog when I try to start a page with VS17. What do I do to take over the rightful use of my one Asp.Net license and have my web app under development compile and run properly??

Hello, 
In my WPF application, non-MVVM, I have a Window and code behind:
The mouse switches to the blue spinning wheel on click, but it's frozen in place. I can't move the mouse, keyboard is stuck (no Ctrl+Alt+Delete), etc. Once the event is done, I can move all throughout the app/OS. Any thoughts on what is happening?

Hi,
I am about to renew my support subscription .  I have had it for years.  
My question:  I want to refactor a current responsive web application to take advantage of the new Progressive Web Application techniques. But I want to use DevExtreme components as well (particularly the dxDataGrid..
How can I simply use dx components? Do I just include the Devextreme javascript references in my old application? I don't want the default Knockout framework setup.
Is there a way to add the devextreme toolbox to the old applications built in Visual Studio?

Hi
I am using ASPXTreelist in two places in my project. In one place it works normally when I expand and collapse  nodes at any level. However, on the other one I can expand the first level child but when I try to expand any child at the 2nd level, all child nodes collapse. I am loading similar kind of data on both trees. What could be the problem? 
Thanks,
Sanjeev 

Hello,
Before the question I'll ask in the end, let me talk what happened to me using XAF, so it justifies why I need to change the form OIDs are generated and also hopefully your engineers do something to fix this problem out of the box.
Here is:
========================
I was always fighting about why my XAF database is kinda slow, sufering to add 1000 lines of data by taking 50s to accomplish that.
Wonder how my customers complained with me saying that is unacceptable.
I agree with them, even with those who have abandoned me because of this.
After  too many hours wasted to create workarounds to mitigate this and get some breath, finally I got a time to investigate this problem deeper.
Result:
** The problem is everything to do with OIDs being GUIDs (with inserts at least) **
After discovered this problem, I got to research over Web, and now I found several articles saying that, even with a real nice solution, which I share here for the posterity (I resumed to the ones I found most important in this case):
 <-- ***this one is very detailed and useful
In my tests, without tweeking anything else in database, I went from 50s to **0s** to insert 1000 records into database.
Zero seconds. Amazing.
Now I think my business cell which is all set with XAF has a better chance to succeed. 
====================
After the explained, I ask you:
How can I change my DCs to completely use CombGuids?
I say completely, because I've tried to use AfterConstruction() method, but then I noticed I have implicit object relations which I don't have control over the generated OIDs
 

aI am trying to add a mobile project to my application.  I have my main views in the default navigation node, but I can only get the About view to show in the app.  Any thoughts on what I might be doing wrong?  I also have other nodes besides default in the mobile app, but I don't expect those to be in the mobile app.

I am trying to seed a spreadsheet with several tabs.  I don't need two-way databinding, I just need to load each tab from a different SQL datasource.
Perhaps my approach is incorrect, but I could not find a way to simply import from a datasource in the ASP.NET controls..
I am using the following command to load the  data:
Note 1: code cut down for brevity.
Note 2: the first tab loads correctly.
       Dim worksheet As DevExpress.Spreadsheet.Worksheet = Nothing
        worksheet = Spreadsheet.Document.Worksheets(0)
        Dim dt As DataTable = CType(SDSBuildingUse.Select(DataSourceSelectArguments.Empty), DataView).Table
        worksheet.DataBindings.BindTableToDataSource(dt, StartRowIndex, StartColumnIndex, opts)
... format column widths and some formulas
...
...
Second tab....
        Spreadsheet.Document.Worksheets.Add("Additional Renewal")
        Dim AddRenewalWKS As DevExpress.Spreadsheet.Worksheet = Spreadsheet.Document.Worksheets("Additional Renewal")
        Dim dt2 As DataTable = CType(SqlDataSource1.Select(DataSourceSelectArguments.Empty), DataView).Table
        
I get the following error on the last line:

How can I hide the gridview column headers when it is resized in adaptive mode.
The gridview is using material theme. 
I try to use below css to override but it did not work; it only worked when the default theme is used instead of material theme.
.dxgvAdaptiveHeaderPanel {
             display: none;
}
The column headers I want to hide are circled in red in the screenshot.
Thanks 

Hi.  We have a WinExplorerView that shows images selected by a user.  If they add a short image, the context buttons do not show on mouseover.  In our program, this causes the user not to be able to delete or open the image full-screen because the context buttons are the only way to do this.
I suggest that context buttons should show on hover even if the image is short.   Users can't understand why I can't fix it for them.  Ugh.
Please see the attached image.  The one on the right does not show context buttons on hover.
Thanks.

Hi,
I have created a WPF project using scaffolding wizard and selected "Hybrid UI View". I am using "17.2.5" version of DevExpress.
My ADO.NET Entity model is connected to northwind database which has a "Categories" table..This table has a field "Picture" whose datatype is "image".  
Scaffolding wizard has created view and View Model for "Categories" table. When I run the project and add a new record with picture, the record get saved in database table. However value of "picture" field is NULL. While adding record when I select image I can see its preview on screen but not sure why the picture is not saved in database. 
I am attaching source code of my project also copying database "Northwind2010" in root folder.  
Could you please fix the issue and share the updated source code as soon as possible?
Thanks

Hi DevEx Support
Your demo code for ASPxTreeList > Editing > Validation refers (
)
Using your sample code, I made one small change: I changed the mode of the editor from "EditFormAndDisplayNode" to "PopupEditForm"
<SettingsEditing Mode="EditFormAndDisplayNode" />
<SettingsEditing Mode="PopupEditForm" />
When validation returns an error condition (i.e. after applying changes), there is a moment that the popup disappears before it becomes visible again to show the error. This causes a flashing effect which is not present in the "EditFormAndDisplayNode" mode.
 Although it is quite brief in your sample code, in my project the database is quite large and the popup disappears for more than a second or two, which is a bit irritating for the user. Is there any way to force the popup editor to remain in view during validation? Or show Loading message? We really prefer to use the popup editor and not the standard edit form.
Thanks for looking into this
Regards

Hello,
let we have flow of with following characteristics:
* Buy or Sell
* Currency
* Volume
I need to visualize structure of this flow taking into account both Buy/Sell and Currency, e.g.
Buy
 - USD/RUB: 100
 - EUR/USD: 250
Sell

How to do it with DevExtreme? 

Hi,
When porting code from a previous .NET 4.7.1 application I encountered the following problem:
When the unit tests projects are .NET Standard/Core projects the unit tests are detected but not executed.
There is already a support ticket for this issue that seems to be resolved. Maybe it will be included in the next version.
As a workaround I changed the test projects to .NET 4.7.1 as target framework.
Afterwards the tests are executed again unless they are inherited from a base class that is located in another assembly.
When placing the base class in the same assembly everything works fine.
This functionality worked fine in the past (even across assemblies) if all projects are referencing .NET 4.7.1 as target framework.
I attached a Demo project and screenshots of a loca test run (Run all)
Kind regards

Hi,
according to the documentation, it should be possible to access all items in the DataSource like this:
    const items = $("#gridContainer").dxDataGrid("instance").option("dataSource").items();
BUT I recieve this error:
myvacantwatches.js:28 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).dxDataGrid(...).option(...).items is not a function     at t.onClick (myvacantwatches.js:28)     at Object.execute (dx.all.js:13)     at t._executeAction (dx.all.js:13)     at t.execute (dx.all.js:13)     at t.<anonymous> (dx.all.js:12)     at t.l [as _clickAction] (dx.all.js:12)     at t._executeClickAction (dx.all.js:25)     at HTMLDivElement.<anonymous> (dx.all.js:25)     at HTMLDivElement.dispatch (jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js:3)     at HTMLDivElement.q.handle (jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js:3) 
The data source object is created this way:
           fetch(curUrl)
                  .then(data => {
                      return data.json();
                  }).then(result => {
                    watchesStore = new DevExpress.data.ArrayStore(result);
                    $("#gridContainer").dxDataGrid("instance").option("dataSource", watchesStore);
                  });
And all the data is shown perfectly.
What am I missing?

Hello
I binding the filtered rows of gridcontrol to a DataTable in Vm like your code:
when I  change values in  the visible dataTable, the grid control is not updated.
How can I change values only of visible rows?

I recently upgraded to version 17.2.5.   Initially I had a problem where the popup menu to add devexpress item was greyed out.  I searched the support tickets and found a hot fix that solved that problem.  The issue I am having now is that the "designer"  I am not sure what it is actually called, that shows when you first create a view that lets you add controls no longer appears.  I included a screen shot from your documentation of what I am supposed to see and instead I see a blank form when I first create a view.  I am able to add controls from the toolbox but being able to quickly setup layouts in a new view using the screen shown in the attached image saves time.  I don't know if part of the problem is that I have version 16.2.5 installed as well.  This problem happens in both existing and new projects when I go to add a view.
Thanks in advance for the help.

Is there a way/event to listen to whenever an user changes the month for the dxScheduler (month view)?
We would like to fetch new data on a monthly basis for optimization purposes,  since there is quite some processing of the data on the server.

Hi
I use an ObjectDataSource to  provide data access to a TreeList. I then use the DataSource postback event handlers (Deleted, Inserted, Updated) to provide feedback to the user on the outcome, by setting the text of a label. 
For example, if a user tries to delete a TreeList item, and for whatever reason it fails, then the user should be notified that it failed and perhaps why it failed.
The problem that I have, is that the feedback label text  does not change when I set it in the DataSource event handlers.
        protected void dsProject_Deleted(object sender, ObjectDataSourceStatusEventArgs e)
        {
            bool ok = true;
            if (e.ReturnValue != null)
            {
                System.Boolean.TryParse(e.ReturnValue.ToString(), out ok);
                if (ok)
                    lblFeedback.Text = "Deleted ok";
                else
                    lblFeedback.Text = "Delete failed!";
            }
        }
Please let me know how to get around this restriction? It is vital that I need to provide feedback to the user on any errors.
I have created a small test app to illustrate the problem. Build, run, then try to delete "Apple". I have explicitly prevented the user to delete this record, to illustrate the problem. The feedback label remains unchanged.
Thank you for looking into this.
Regards

Hello,
let we have flow of trades with following characteristics:
* Trade direction (Buy or Sell)
* Currency (USD/RUB, EUR/RUB etc)
* Trade Volume
I need to visualize structure of this flow taking into account both Buy/Sell and Currency features:
Buy
 - USD/RUB: 100
 - EUR/USD: 250
Sell
 - USD/RUB:120
 - EUR/USD: 300
 - CNY/USD: 120
I.e. we have two categorical dimensions (trade direction, currency) and one floating-point direction. 
How to visualize it using DevExtreme? (I have posted related ticket with two pie-chart-halves)

A form is defined in Angular app using DevExtreme 17.2.5 as following:
For items with colspan=2 occupying entire row, a right padding of 15 px is displayed, via css rule:
This does not seem correct, as it created visual interference;
It seems that when an item occupies entire row via colspan, it should have "dx-last-col" class
Please consider attached screenshots for more details.

Hi guys,
I have applied bestfit to the async completion event so my Pivotgrid will autofit:
I only really need this to happen on the top 20 fields  (my XAML has area set to all and visibile rows). When this runs it causes the async loading symbol to freeze and it takes quite a long time for something so simple.
Is it possible to speed this up? And ensure the loading doesn't freeze?
Many thanks,

I want to convert files with Fiele attachments from other types to PDF
I begun with jpg to pdf:
but my result data is corrupted . I want to use memory stream (avoid any temporary files). What I do wrong ?
When I try with temporary file all is ok, but I get temporary file :(
?

In the dashboard designer, if the user creates a calculated field with an error in it, for example, attempting to convert a an empty string to date, the user is thrown from the designer to an empty page with the error. I would like to allow the user to gracefully handle this error instead of redirecting to another page. What event is thrown when a formula is invalid?

Hi again,
I have a problem trying to bind an observable collection to a chart.
I took one of your examples, the E2595, I've modified the code according to  my needs but I'm not able to reach my goal.
I have three problems, the first one I want to change the graph type, from pie to bar chart,
the second one I don't understand why if I move the filling of data from constructor to the populate button method the program doesn't show anything.
And the thirdh one when I click on add point, nothing happens.
Could you please help me?
Thank you

I have a FilterControl with the SourceControl set to a GridControl.
The user has the option to rename the column caption at run-time, However, the changes do not get reflected in the FilterControl. 
I have put together a sample application, where you can rename grid columns, and it will not reflect in the FilterControl. 
Please let me know if there's any way to trigger the FilterControl to update the column captions.

Hi,
I have a basic winforms project with the dev express datagrid, a binding navigator, and a bindingsource. I'm retrieving data from SQL server 2016 via an oData service.
The data is returned to the datagrid as expected but when I edit the values I'm unable to write them back to the database.
Before using oData, I would have bound the grid to the binding source which in tern was bound to a table adapater and that to the SQL database.
To write changes back to the SQL database I would have used something like;
When using oData (which is very new to me). I'm unable to achieve the same and my changes are not written back to the database;
Would it be possible to get a simple example of how to write data back to a SQL database via oData v4.
Many thanks

Dear Support,
in my application I have defined a state diagram. I have specified the corresponding transitions for each status. That's what I did when the application was done in English. The users who run the application in German also have the English buttons. It's not pretty. How can I do the localization?
Thank you very much!

Hello,
 
I want to make a layout of the attached type to edit the master and details rows simultaneous
in one XtraForm using the following objects:

Hello there,
I have a particular grid that I am grouping and ordering by an unbound column . The column value is set by a timer in a behavior class....When the row is expanded (by clicking on it with mouse) the row gets automatically collapsed again (when the behavior timer ticks over)...
I am wondering if there was a way to change that?
(I have attached a mp4 video that demonstrates the problem I am having. I hope that it helps)
For reference the timer behavior code is here;
I have noticed that if I expand ALL the rows. They remain expanded. It is only if I expand individual rows that they get collapsed. The code I use to expand the columns is as follows;
Thank you kindly for any thoughts

Hi guys, I have some further questions stemming from this thread 
;
In my scaffold wizard generated app, I am trying to achieve the following requirements;
- I want to be able to have any view type listed in my NavBarControl (I.e. Others as well as those generated by the scaffold wizard, whether based on an an entity or not.)
- I want to be able to control which modules are open in the DocumentManagerService on application startup
- I want to prevent duplicate documents being opened when the document is a module in the NavBarControl (for example. If I have added one manually to the documentManagerService, I don't want it to be duplicated when I choose it from the NavBarControl)
What is the best approach to achieve that? I could be wrong, but it seems to me that the modules have to be based on entites? I cannot seem to add a module that is just any old viewmodel...I feel that I need to remove the complication and just write something simpler? Would that be a better way to go than trying to modify the wizard's code?
If anyone could point me in the right direction that'd be super helpful
Thank you

Hello,
     While I'm waiting for my order to be processed, I am using a trial version to get familiar with the DevExtreme controls for .NET Core 2. The issue I'm having is related to MasterDetail configuration using a RemoteContoller. On the child grid, I am trying to pass the ID value to a webservice and everything would work if it wasn't for the extra stuff passed in the query string.
For example:
&_=1519004105944
I don't like having to pass "id=" but that's workable for the most part. The ? character is what's causing me the issue with the grid saying it cannot find the remotecontroller. I would like to simple pass the GUID but I can't figure out how. Any idea's on how to fix this??

Hi there,
I need some help here. I keep following tutorial from youtube about DevExpress and make it Try and Error for myself.
But here I got something that I can't handle even I read the documentation, I still can't make it.
How do I select CurrentRow for Data Grid Control?
Here is my code. 

Hi, I'm having a problem with new forms that are opened through the KeyDown event of a searchControl fixed in the ribbon status bar.
To explain what happens, run the attached project and check the following:
 
1- Create 2x a new form via the Ribbon Open Form button
2- Click on any area of the RibbonPageGroup2 and see that the last form is still active
3- Now, focus the searchEdit on the form's statusbar and press enter
4- Click on any area of RibbonPageGroup2 and see that the penultimate form is activated, but the focus should remain on the last created tab (form).
I noticed that this only occurs when the form is created via the searchControl's keyDown event.
I'm doing something wrong, how do I solve this?
Thank you very much for your help.

Hi
I am trying to do a custom calculation for a GroupSummary item based on other group Summary items.
For example my group summary has total GP and total Sales for thier columns i would like to make a group summary that calculates Sales * GP, but at a group level.

I am using a LookupEdit in my grid view. I am using the GridViewCustomRowCellEditForEditing event to assign the correct repository editor at runtime.
When I set the language culture to Arabic for the application the items in the list and editor are shown incorrectly. I have two strings in the datasource that is assigned to the editor.
 
3840 x 2160 
1920 x 1080 
 
When displayed in Arabic culture these strings are shown as
 
x 2160 3840 
X 1080 1920 
 
Any reason to why this is happening? 
 

Your wpf accordion control documentation shows it collapsing to the left when the iscollapsedbuttonvisible is true.  Is there a way of collapsing the winforms accordion control to the left in a similar fashion.  I can't find a property that enables me to switch the collapse direction from vertical to horizontal.

For the official demo, when expand the detail datagird of last master row at 1st time, the datagrid only can show half of detail page. After collapse and re-expand the detail page of last master row, then the detail content could show fully. Please help to check. Thank you.

I'm trying to create a report made of 14 pages and for each page I am loading the image watermark by code.
Below is the method I'm using to generate the watermark for each page :
When I preview the report for the first time using the ASPxWebDocumentViewer , all goes well, but when I try to preview it again 
, I get the below error :
I know this is a normal exception as I'm using lots of resources especially that the total size of the 14 images is 41 MB, but is there a way to release
the memory used  after assigning the watermark ?
Please note that this app will be used by several users and I can't decrease the size/resolution of the images  otherwise the text will be unclear when printing the report.

I have looked at article T502110  to find a way to expand all detail rows fully when a form is opened.  The form has a master with 2 levels of detail.  The first level expands, but the 2nd does not.  Even expanding manually takes a lot of resizing.
Please look at my attachment.  The first screen shot is how the form presently opens using the example cited.  The second screen shot is how I want the form to open (ie,  expand all the detail rows to show all the child rows in each detail row.)   Note:  the grid control is docked in a split container which is docked in the form.


Hi,
I've just created a basic asp.net mvc app using the DevExpress wizard which includes a grid as its main content and while it seems to be resizing correctly in some browsers, it doesn't seem to be the case for all browsers.
I've included a screencast to highlight the problem. Hopefully this will help in resolving the problem.
In the recording, I've included a couple of other questions i.e. 
I'm only getting started with this new app and I will have a lot of questions over the next few months but I really need this new app to be compatible with all browsers on desktop (and hopefully on mobile devices as well but not as important right now).
Thanks.

Hi, I have a DockLayoutManager placed in a BackStageView. After undocking some LayoutPanel and closing the Backstageview I need to keep this FloatGroup visible. OwnsFloatWindows works only in case of minimizing the main window.

I attached the simple app to demonstrate this - just run the app, undock the "Title" LayoutPanel by mouse and close the BackstageView and this LayoutPanel will hide.

Hi Support,
I know I've seen a similar ticket to this however I thought I'd shed some more light onto the issue.  I've upgraded laptops, on the previous laptop I had VS2015 with DevExpress 16.2 installed, with a working Add Item menu.  I upgraded that version of VS from 2015 - 2017.  The Add Item menu still appeared fine.
On the new laptop I just installed VS2017 and 16.2, no Add Item menu.  So the functionality does work in 2017 but the installer doesn't add it to a fresh install of 2017, rather the 2017 install on top of a 2015 install must migrate it.
Is there a possibility of a workaround for 16.2.3 as updating to a later version isn't going to be realistic over the next 6 months.  Also, when I add a ExtraForm using the template gallery it doesn't have the consistent look and feel of the other forms when added through the Add Item menu.  Strange I know but true.
Thanks

Hello,
We plan to migrate our product ot WPF.
The current customize layout functionality in Xpf (DevExpress for WPF) be it DXLayoutControl or DXDocking is missing some of its WinForms counterparts.
More precisely the ability to customize the properties of controls contained in LayoutControlItem if using DXDocking after they have been added. We saw that a 
 issue was raised 7 years ago. In that issue it was suggested to use DXDocking instead of LayoutControl. In the meantime its dependency (the PropertyGrid) was implemented in DevExpress 13.1.4. but this feature stil lacks in DXDocking customization window in DevExpress 17 (based on demo).
We'd like to know how we can have roughly the same customizations as in WinForm in XPF also?
We need the same customization features as in WinForm's LayoutControl i.e:
- control's property editing (colors, sizes, captions etc.)
- being able to drag and drop elements from a customization window.
Thank you.

Hello,
I'm using the spellchecher on a form and I would like to show the "asyoutype" visual feedback on all controls of the container at the same time.
I create the spellchecker by:
var spellChecker = new DevExpress.XtraSpellChecker.SpellChecker
                             {
                                 SpellCheckMode= IsEnabled ? SpellCheckMode.AsYouType : SpellCheckMode.OnDemand
                             };
            spellChecker.OptionsSpelling.IgnoreUpperCaseWords = DefaultBoolean.False;
            spellChecker.OptionsSpelling.IgnoreMixedCaseWords = DefaultBoolean.False;
            
            spellChecker.Culture = _currentCultureInfo;
            spellChecker.CheckAsYouTypeOptions.CheckControlsInParentContainer = true;           
And I assign it to a "container control:
  public void CheckContainer(Control control)
        {
            var spellChecker = GetSpellChecker();
            spellChecker.ParentContainer = control;
            spellChecker.Check(control);
        }
However the feedback is only being shown for the editor that have the focus.
The only way that I found to accomplish this is to create one spellchecker "per" control but it means that I have to manually create it and assign it to each control on a form. Also I'm concerned about the performance in such case.
Is there any other way to do it?
Thank you in advance

I would like to be able to keep the column headers on screen at all times while the gridview itself is show.

Is it possible? 

Hello, DevExpress support, 
I have descendant of PopupContainerEdit which is used for searching in the inner grid, just like lookup. 
And I need that PopupContainerEdit's TextEdit still focused even if popup is opened, which was working perfectly in 17.1.4 when I upgraded to 17.2.5 
it's not working as intended, popup closes right after text edit got focus. 
Please check attached project (17.1.4) and compare behavior after update to 17.2.5
Thanks.   

If the text is longer than column width it will currently wrap and the row height will increase. Sometimes this will mean that some rows are different heights which can look messy.

Is it possible to disable the SUM functionality from the Value section ? (Image attached). I would like to have no function associated with this because as it is now the row values (red circle) do not coincide with the database values.
Can you help me with this issue ?
Thank you 

Hello,
 I have GridControl  and one of the column has a combobox. GridControl is bound the a UserList (User Class ). Combobox is bound to a UserGroupList (UserGroup Class). I want to bind Combobox's SelectedValue to a User Class property but I could not figure it out.
What should be the XXXX ?I. I could not get the bound user class from GridColumn. 

I have a tag box in application and i want to search over large amount of data in type ahead mode. and i want tag box to display grid in the dropdown.
is that something possible without slowing down application?  
Please find my code attached. 

The attachment, focus.png, shows a Treelist with the root node identified by the text "All Groups" and with the focus set on a lower node identified by the text "temp1".
The focus has been placed on "temp1" with a call to Treelist.SetFocusedNode() and is shown by the marker/pointer to the left of the node.
However, if I set the focus on the node 
, the  node also appears with a border round it. How can I achieve the same outcome programmatically?

Hi! I've faced very strange issue with the table being incorrectly rendered when it is split over two pages.
We are using subreports to crate isolated table-like part with 
 and 
 in our reports. 
When it happens that 
 does not fit the page - then it and the page header are cut and split across two pages.
See an attached example. 
I've fond a lot of similar tickets but none of the approaches helped to solve the issue. I've tried to:
- set 
 to Smart on both root report and subreport  - as 
- set KeepTogether  to True on all tables, table rows and table cells - as 
 and 
(we have higher version so I expect that I do not need any patch)
There is also one 
, but it is a little bit old. 
While I was experimenting with this issue I found a strange case - it is not reproduced if there is some content before the subreport control (e.g. other labels). So for now I'm just adding empty label of 5px height (minimum that I was able to achieve) to avoid this. But for me this solution seems not reliable. 
Could you suggest some better way to fix this issue? 

Hi,
What I wanted to achieve is SimpleButton which look a little bit different, so I've come up with this code:
I have several problems with this code:
1.) The BIButton doesn't show up in Toolbox, despite setting [ToolboxItem(true)]
2.) In runtime button looks as expected except AppearanceDisabled.BorderColor value is ignored. It seems that Appearance.BackColor is used instead.
I tried as well achieve this by creating skin, but couldn't set independent BackColor/ForeColor for activated/deactivated states.

Hi DevExpress !
I need to speed up the display of a LayoutControl with many controls.
In my application, the end-users can customize the LayoutControl at their convenience, and so, in the end, a lot of controls are actually hidden.
Generally, they do it once and for all and most of the time they use the customized layout.
So, the main idea is now to detect which layout items actually visible and to only restore (and generate edit controls) these ones.
Could you guide me in this task ?
Thank you.

hello,
i have an optimisation to make, i have a scheduler on GuantView,  conflicts are allowed but we manage appointment to have no conflict, as we have calculate automatically when to move them on drop. the show more button are active.
when we drag an appointment that is already planned on the scheduler the drag creates a shadow of the appointment that is always visible, even when draging over existing appointemnt.
when we drag an appointment not planned from a XtragridView  to the scheduler, the shadow shows when there is an  empty space, but shows "More buttons" when dragged over an existing appointment.
how can i have the shadow, when we drag an unplanned appointment, over an existing appointment.
it is not on drop, only the drag part that interests me,
 Thank you for you support.

hi!
we re using some richeditcontrols bound to the same windows forms binding source.
the problem occurs if we try to add text to more than one richedit at once.
we are using 
and usedeferreddatabindingnotifications is set to false
if we dont use: databindings[0].WriteValue() then the inserted text gets lost if we try to save.
the richeditcontrols are in tabcontrols and layoutcontrols etc.
any suggestions?

HI,
I'd like to partially paint a grid cell with multiple solid colors in terms of percentage where each solid color represent something (not linear gradient)
See attached sample for example - here green color represent % OK, red means % wrong, yellow means % warning.
Would you suggest how to achieve something like this, so far all the API and documentation i've read fills rectangle in one or two colors. Please do correct me.
Many Thanks,
 


I found it that why i am getting this issue. I have used summary properties in my data grid and i have to show some custom value to the column. The same i have created in sample project and now i am getting the same issue in sample application also.
PFA of the attached sample project where this issue has been illustrated.
Thanks,

Thank you getting back to me.
I see the issue. but now in the column I am not seeing drop down. I need a drop down in the column so that I can choose any data from the drop down. 

Hi,
i'm using the an uri pattern to show a hyperlink in the dashbaord viewer.

Hi,
with 17.2.5 still got this same error as the one described in the 
 ticket. HTTP activation is checked (for both .Net 3.5, and 4.5), and "svc-integrated" Handler Mapping is set to System.ServiceModel.Activation.HttpHandler.
Any idea?

Hi,
After the upgrade from 2017.1.5 to 2017.2.5 my scheduler control comes up with an ArgumentOutOfRange exception. After some research I found out that the exception was caused by using date range in the scheduler until the max DateTime value in C#. The calendar of the scheduler now tries to add anonther day to the max value which is not allowed.
So in code we set the LimitInterval like this:

Hi,
There seems to be a problem with the XtraCharts.SeriesSorting property.
In the screenshot "SeriesSorting.png", you can see the property "Reihensortierung" selected. Changing this property has no effect whatsoever on the sorting of the data series.
If I use the following script it works fine though:
private void chart12_BeforePrint(object sender, System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventArgs e) {
      chart12.SeriesSorting = SortingMode.Ascending;
}
Please note: the screenshot shows the chart within an XtraReport. The problem exists both when I put a chart on a windows form as well as within an XtraReport.
I could find no way of setting this property correctly through properties only in the XtraReport.
However, using both the Chart Designer and the Chart Assistant on a WinForm it is possible to set this property, see screenshot "chart_assistant.png"
If I may hazard a guess then I'd say that something got confused about sort series order and series sort order or some other very similar looking terms.

I have an application where end users can design reports.  I open the report designer using ReportDesignTool.ShowRibbonDesignerDialog.  The application works when built as x86 ok, but when built as x64 the designer hangs after certain operations.  
In the x64 version, once the designer is open, the user can manipulate some aspects of the design.  But, if (for example) we select a field and try to assign a style, the design hangs and must be killed at the moment of the style selection.
I have tested this error by rebuilding ReportMainDemo solution after building it as x64 platform (rather than Any CPU) in configuration manager.  When the demo is run, there are errors loading SqlLite (which is built for Any CPU), but we can still open the report designer and demonstrate the error as described above.  Contact me if you can not reproduce the error easily. 

I have a problem with the LayoutControl.
I want to add a custom control with a fixed width to the layout control, but it does not behave as I expect.
My code:
* I have a custom "FixedWidthControl" where I add buttons.
* If the custom property Orientation == Orientation.Horizontal, I want the buttons to appear next to eachother and the custom control should then have a fixed height of 22px.
* If the custom property Orientation == Orientation.Vertical, I want the buttons to appear underneath eachother and the custom control should then have a fixed width of 100px.
As an example, see the code in attachment. The Form1 has 2 of my custom control inside. One with Horizontal (bottom) and one with Vertical orientation set. What does not work is:
* In the case of Orientation.Vertcal, the buttons show up like I want, but the LayoutControlItem width is larger than 100px (while the custom control is only 100px). This means that the LayoutControlItem takes up more room, which should be allocated (I expected) to the TextEdit instead.
See attachment.
I expect the Action 0 - 2 to align to the right of the form and have the TextEdit (test edit) to be the full width of the form (minus 100px).
Can you help me or give me some directions where I should look?
 

Hi Kirill,
The Editing works know great. If you try to sort the a column you got a Exception "DevExpress.Data.Helpers.InconsistencyDetectedException" in DevExpress.Data.v17.1.dll" . I checked the database of double entries and there aren't any. Maybe this is a new ticket. I found such cases in T569116 and T478749 and much more, but didn't help me. 
I checked the first Project I sent you 
 and this also has the exception. May also a binding is not correct. I tried, but I don't know what the problem is. I can't debug it.

Hi,
I am examing this sample 
I want to update a record with form layout. But i am not binding the object id to layout, i am getting it from the querystring  .
In this sample , the related id passing to  the controller and object getting from database(actually Session) and changing its properties with the new ones .
Is this the best way ? Can i get all the new object with new values from form layout without getting the old object from database.I can post the updated object  to controller but its own id is missing. Can you provide me a sample ?

Hello,
I am trying to implement remote paging using the data grid component. While doing so, I face issues when I select and de-select all the items. The out of box checkbox solution of data grid for doing so , seems to be completely broken. Once I select all the curren items , I cannot deselect them. Moreover, the select all checkbox from data grid selects only the contents from the current page.
The request that gets fired during the paging remote operation has loadOptions as "null", during this ajax call, which leads to invalid request. The select all checkbox only selects the current page records.
Since I did not any apt example for this on the website of yours, can you please  have a look and provide me with assistance. 
I have attached the simplified code base for your understanding.I have also attached the screenshot of the checkbox that I am talking about.
Framework used:- Angular 5 .

I've mentioned in another post that I have a form in my current project that has a great many controls on it. In VS 2012 it's very slow to make modifications. It's a nightmare in fact. I avoid working with it. Someone outside of DevExpress suggested the notion of using something like frames where each group of controls in a tab page for example is on its own form and then I refer to that form as a sort of "sub form" in the main form when running the application.  
In MS Access this is easy. It's also not a big deal in Delphi. But there's no native ability in vb.net to put a subform on a form. 
It seemed from this other guy's suggestion that he might have been talking about your EditFormUserControl but I looked into it and that doesn't seem to be right.
Is there a way to do what he suggested? It might make code behind a little more awkward but it would relieve the nightmare of the speed problem with a form with a great many controls on it.

This is the part I do not understand.
Nowhere in my code I used DockLayoutManager , yet this exception is thrown. I wonder if it is something in the DialogBoxService or richeditcontrol and I am not closing it properly? I have 3 buttons for the dialog box, 2 of them closes the dialog box. If I click the one that doesn't, everything is fine. If I click either of the 2 buttons that closes the window or the X at top right, the application would enter the break mode.
I copy  the code from the example in the documentation, and the code works fine with textbox or richtextbox. It only happens when I use richeditcontrol.
Thank you very much for all the help. 

Hi,
I have to quick questions regarding the use of an collapsible accordion control
1)  I have the accordioncontrol in a layoutpanel to the right of the screen. But the collapse arrow then points the wrong way. Is there any easier way to change that than to override the collapse button template? If not do you have an example of that for reversing the arrow? Using the FlowDirection sets the scrollbar on the wrong side... Am I overlooking some property? 
2) If the layout panels allow resizing, and you resize the panel containing the  accordioncontrol and then collapse it, the accordioncontrol will collapse to the left rather than to the right and the size of the panel won't resize

I've encountered a problem when copy-pasting filter strings within the Text tab page from the FilterString editor the filterString is processed incorrect when dealing with a Boolean Value.  
Steps to reproduce in demo center:
1. Open report designer
2.  Add boolean field
3. Add filterString via FilterString editor on band and use boolean field in expression
4. Close  FilterString editor dialog via OK button -> Results in FilterString "[FIELD] = 
"
5.  Reopen FilterString editor 
6. Copy (Ctrl-C) expression in Text tab page "FIELD = 'YES'"
7. Clear filterString in Text tab page
8. Close  FilterString editor dialog via OK button -> Results in FilterString ""
8.  Reopen FilterString editor 
9  Paste (Ctrl-V) expression in Text tabpage "FIELD = 'YES'"
10. Close  FilterString editor dialog via OK button -> Results in invalid FilterString "[FIELD] = '
'"
See attachment for example in demo center. 

Thanks Nikolai!

We have introduced some dragdrop functionality which is only active when the dragged data contains 'Rich Text Format' data. This works fine, but there's one thing I don't understand: we see two cursors when dragging. I've attached a screenshot of the two cursors: one with a solid line and one with a dashed line. 
These cursors behave differently. We're adjusting the position of the solid-line-cursor in OnDragOver. This is done like:
            float x = ToTargetUnit(richEdit.Unit, richEdit.DpiX, (float)position.X);
            float y = ToTargetUnit(richEdit.Unit, richEdit.DpiY, (float)position.Y);
            System.Drawing.PointF point = new System.Drawing.PointF(x, y);
            return richEdit.GetPositionFromPoint(point);
If this returns not null, then we set the CaretPosition to the retrieved position. When dropping, the data is inserted at this position.
The dashed-line-cursor, however, moves much smoother. My questions are:
1) What is this dashed-line-cursor? 
2) Is it possible that the caretposition follows this dashed-line-cursor?
 


Hi,
Our application is still on version 14.2.6 and we cannot upgrade to a newer version due to various reasons. Is their a way to fix this issue in version 14.2.6? 
Using a boolean flag to remember that the event is already processed during the current request does not seem to be a solution.
When I add trace logging in the SelectionChanged Event handler of my controller I find that the SelectionChanged events are not 'nested'; they are triggered one after another. Hence I do not see how a boolean local variable would help me in this case? I did notice that every time a selection change is made in the listview that for the 
 SelectionChanged the 
, whereas for the 
SelectionChanged the 
 (My listview only allows a single row to be selected):



By testing the value of the CurrentObject I can solve the issue for this ListView. Can you explain to me in more detail how and where I would set a local variable to keep track of the current request? Setting it to true at the start of the SelectionChanged and to false at the end of the SelectionChanged event handler will not help me as they are triggered one after another, right?

Hey folks
i studied your documentation and read many tickets like 
 or 
, however i having trouble getting it to work.
I'm trying to build a ReportDesigner for Win and ASP.net  which supports all kind of 
 like the ones you supports for your Dashboard Control.
Win ReportDesigner (without OLAP) works like a charm. But i have enormous problems to get it to work for the ASPxReportDesigner.
I attached a sample, which shows what i'm trying to do.
I have to support SQL Databases, XML and Excel/CSV Files.
I have to support CustomQuerys (
) for all kind of sql data sources
It seems there is no wizard like the Excel/CSV Wizard  for handling this kind of Files (I created always a 
)
Since i can not define a query for each data source, because i do not know the schema, tables and so on of any(!) data source (data sources are created by End-user) i struggle to get any Table/View/SP item of the data source - although I set the 
at Application_Start, the "Select data member" and "Select data fields" lists are empty.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Regards,
Micha

Attached is a sample project demonstrating the current progress. Refer to the SearchMyPersonController.actionNext_Execute method. I am trying to get the selected item from the listview and then set it as current object so that the second tab is populated with Person Data.
The approach suggested in the 
 ticket does not seem to work. The second tab is always blank. For selected person it adds a dropdown whereas I need the entire object to be displayed in second tab in editable format. That's the reason I had inherited from Person object in the first place. Also SelectedPerson is always null so it goes to IF only and never goes to ELSE.
 I don't think the functionality required can be implemented as it is too complex for a design like this.
Anyway thank you for your help.

Hi!
I have a control ASPxSplitter. When panes of this control are dynamically formed in the server-side with specified ContentUrl and ContentUrlIFrameName, the client-side event PaneContentUrlLoaded is not fired. But when I add these panes in the html-code, the  client event PaneContentUrlLoaded is fired. Please, help me! Why the client-side event PaneContentUrlLoaded is not fired in the first case. Moreover, can the client side event PaneContentUrlLoaded be fired after changing the ContentUrl during callback in the server-side.

Hi,
I'm trying to use the localization features of DevExtreme, but I can't make it work.
There are 2 problems:
a) loading messages 'fr' does not work. When I right-click on the datagrid headers, I still see the English texts.
b) the number editor isn't formatting it's value using the current locale (with a komma as a decimal separator)
I've added a testproject in attachment.
Note: to be able to import the 'fr' messages as a module, I've had to modify the typings.ts file .

Hi,
When I copy this exactly: 
I get these errors in SplashScreen1.cs:

What is wrong please? Do I need to add references to my project?

Hello!
Suppose there is a GridControl with GridView, and latter displays SQLite table rows in async server mode (readonly). GridView allows us to filter, order by column values, etc. After applying such operations we have different order of rows, and the question is how to get a list of indices (indices of original rowIDs) in order of their presence on GridView, especially in case of large datasource.
Attaching an application initializes large SQLite table (Person info) and then GridView connection to it via XPInstanceFeedbackSource session. This application already includes selection of rowIDs (by clicking at right upper button) using a simple approach by selecting all rows and then retrieving 'id' values from related cells of each row. Is there a way to improve a performance for such operation, and the other question, is it possible to impelement so in case when 'id' column is omitted?
Thank you!

Hello support team,
I cannot get the standalone ImageComboBox control binding working with XPO. Perhaps you can give me a direction what I'm doing wrong. This is my code:
XPO Status has properties: short Oid, string Text
XPO SomeObject has properties: ..., Status Status, ...
Then I try to setup the standalone ImageComboBox 'icboStatus' with binding to the SomeObject.Status property:
Binding of other properties works fine. When setting breakpoints and inspecting the controls everything seems to be okay. ImageCombo is correctly filled with status text and image. But the binding doesn't work. Let's say SomeObject.Status is 'Status1' the combo doesn't show this and remains blank. If I select another status, say 'Status2', the bound field isn't changed in any way.
When checking the combo in EditValueChanges the EditValue is never of type Status but some XPCollection. I think that's why the binding doesn't work since I have to assign a valid Status object. Am I thinking wrong?
Thank you

Hi,
When navigating through different records in a detailview [in edit mode] the caption shown in the header is incorrect . 
In the Model Editor we have set the ObjectCaptionFormat to a simple DisplayName as  {0:DisplayName}
When clicking the 'Next Record' button, we expect to see:
Client1
Client2
Client3
Client4
Instead we get:
 Client1
 Client1
Client2
Client3
Client4 .
All edit fields in the view are shown correctly and also the 'please wait..' screen is shown while loading.

Hello Team,
We have upgraded dll's from 16.2.3 version to 17.2.5 version and generating the reports using .repx file path, but in upgrade version not export generated report design to .pdf file properly, getting some zooming issues at 100%, line spacing, truncate lines etc.
Please let me know how to resolve these design issues in 17.2.5 and provide any example to solve the problem.
Please run the attached sample applications and observe the export pdf files in both the versions.
Pdf and .repx files.
Sample application for 17.2.5
Sample application for 16.2.3

As far as I can see these do pretty much the same things.
1. If there any information on what scenarios suit each control?
2. What are the main differences?

Hi,
I am desperately trying to get a CheckBox column into my TreeList.
I can display the CheckBox but I can't manage to get it editable.
I need it editable as soon as I display the TreeList. 
My current approach is  to set the  DataCellTemplateContent:
But when I display the TreeList I get some javascript error:
How can I get a CheckBox column that is editable right away?

I need to change the default property of Find panel in grid view.
Instead of having a clear button separately  can we change any property so the "X" button is in the find panel textbox.

Hi Team,
I'm using below controller for disabling Detailview for ListView.
public partial class DisableDetailViewController : ViewController<ListView>, IModelExtender

But when I click on Listview record. it redirecting to blank Detailview. 
It should restrict DetailView 
Thanks. 

Hi Support,
I have a datagrid with the usual 'insert new row' inline, one row each time, validation and then save to the SQL DB.
Now the customer is asking for multiple 'insert multiple new rows', it means add some rows and then with ButtonClick fill specifig colunms (bt1 for Date, bt2 for Material....). After that some field will be changed manually and at the end all new records should be committed to SQL DB.
Could u suggest how to solve the 'multiple' matter?
Tks in advance and regards, Giovanni

Hi,
I have a pivotGrid in my page.
I've added to the column array a new attribute "tooltip : xxx" with different value for each column.
onCelllPrepared I want to add function onhover that will show a tooltip  with value from the tooltip attribute
My function:
It works fine.
I have one problem:
When i have 2 fields in row area, and i click on the first one to open the second field
Then the tooltip of the first field stays open
Please find attached a small video that showsthe problem
Thanks 

I have a table called "Provision Hold Edits" bound to a grid control. The table has 7 fields:
1. biHold_id          bigInt            Identity     Not Visible
2. biPCR_id          bigInt
3. biClient_id        bigInt 
4. Description       varchar(200)
5. biUsePCR         bigInt
6. bActive              bit
7. cClaimType       char(1)
 When the grid control loads the table data, the first row has the focus and all visible columns appear as expected. However, in every row following the first row, the column representing the value in biPCR_id is not appearing but every other value for the other columns in the row do appear. If you move the focus to the next row, the value for the column representing biPCR_id in that row now appears, but the value for biPCR_id for the row you just left, disappears. That same thing happens for every row that you change focus to or from. I cannot figure out why that BigInt value should be any different from any of the other BigInt values in the table that display perfectly.
Please see my attached documentation. Thanks! 

Hello,
how can I change the color of the arrow for a Barsubitem which is used in the QuickAccessToolbar of a ribbon with Ofiice 2016 Colorful style?
I use a custom ribbon in Office 2016 Colorful style, but modified to paint the title bar color as gray instead of blue
this is because I need ribbonform controls whithin it with Office 2016 Colorful aspect. The problem is that the ribbon should be blue, and the arrow for a barsubitem in the quickaccess toolbar is white, but I need to set it to a darker value because I'm overriding the title bar back color to paint it as gray.
How can I achive this? 
Also, the user can change the theme of the application between Office 2016 Colorful, Office 2016 Dark and Office 2016 Black, therefore I need it to have the arrow in white color in Dark and Black themes, but something dark when I use the Office 2016 Colorful theme.
Could you help me?
Thanks!!!

I am evaluating rewriting one of our DevExpress Winforms Apps to a Windows 10 App.  It's a Mapping Application.  I am trying to migrate our custom map provider over and I cannot seem to get it to work.  We have this working for WinForms so I'm not sure what I'm missing.  I've noticed there are a few overridable methods on the Winforms platform that I cannot implement for a Win 10 App but these don't seem like important methods that could be causing the issue.
Do you have a working example of a custom provider for the Win10 Map Control?

Hello,
we're evaluating your Report Suite and are running into some problems. 
First off we're trying to convert our CrystalReports documents into your format. We tried the converters  we found in this post (
), but we didn't manage to get it running.
Our CrystalReports-Version is 13.0 .22 and XtraReports Suite Version is 15.2.16.
The second problem we are dealing with is, how we can  pass the DB connection-string to the Report Wizard? We are using a InterSystems Cach? Database and tried our "standard-connectionstring" but it didn't work. Can you please provide us a sample custom connection string?

Hi,
I would like to point out a couple of errors in the Italian translation of ASPxScheduler.  I am aware I can change those by creating a custom translation (and I actually did), but these completely change the meaning of the labels, so I thought it would be useful to share them with you.
String ASPxSchedulerStringId.Form_AllDayEvent should read as 'Intera giornata'. The current translation 'Tutti gli eventi del giorno' actually means 'All the events of that day'. 
String ASPxSchedulerStringId.Form_ButtonDismiss should read as 'Elimina'. The current translation 'Respingere' actually means 'To reject'.
String ASPxSchedulerStringId.Form_ButtonDismissAll  should read as 'Elimina tutti'. The current translation 'Licenziare tutti' actually means 'Fire them all', as in firing an employee (!).
String ASPxSchedulerStringId.Form_SnoozeInfo should read as 'Clicca Posponi per rimandare il promemoria a tra:'. The current translation keeps the word 'Snooze' untranslated and uses an awkward phrase structure.
String ASPxSchedulerStringId.Form_OpenEditForm  should read as 'Apri la finestra di modifica...'. The current translation sounds like 'Open shape edit...'.
String ASPxSchedulerStringId.Form_StartTime should read as 'Ora di inizio:' . The current translation actually means 'Startup timeout'.
 
I hope to find them corrected in the future,
Thanks and have a nice day 

Hi!
I'm trying to create events by dragging from a TcxGrid to a TcxScheduler. I want the drag operation to look and feel as if dragged from the scheduler, so with the event being drawn at current mouse pointer position. Attached is a wmv video of our Silverlight application to illustrate. 
Examples I found are more plain, creating the event when the drag operation finishes e.g.. But lacking the drawing of the event during drag. 
I have attached a sample project with one approach that seems to be the farthest I've gotten. The access violation when drag finishes is not the main issue.  The issue is that the event is invisible during drag, during debugging I sometimes saw it, but as soon as drag started it is gone again. I'm not confident that this is the correct approach. 
Any help in accomplishing this task is appreciated. 

Hello, i am actually working with a dxSelectBox to load some itens that are loaded from a database, they are all loaded at the same time,
but i need them to be loaded dynamically depending on the date that the user inserts, the data being loaded based on date is working,
but to make this work, i need the datasource of the dxSelectBox to be reloaded in order to refresh the data in the selectBox everytime that
the user changes the date, i was trying to create an instance of it in my component file, but is getting undefined, there is another way of
dynamically reloading the datasource or is my approach for this situation wrong?
dxSelectBox HTML:
<div class="dx-field">
    <div class="dx-field-label">Entidade:</div>
    <div class="dx-field-value">
      <dx-select-box 
      #dxEntidades
      [dataSource]="entidades"
      [disabled]="disabled"
      [(ngModel)]="entidade"
      placeholder="Selecione uma entidade"
      displayExpr="ds_entidade"
      valueExpr="id_entidade"
      noDataText="Nenhuma entidade encontrada.">
    </dx-select-box>
    </div>
  </div>
loading function:
@ViewChild(DxSelectBoxComponent) selectBox: DxSelectBoxComponent;
public getEntidades(ano) {
    let selectBoxDataSource = this.selectBox.instance.getDataSource();

Hello
In our XAF web application we often invoke reports directly from Actions.
We have 2 common situations: a Simple Action that just shows the report preview, and a Popup Window Action that prompts for some details then show the report.
Since moving to the ReportsV2 module the Popup Window scenario does not work.
I have attached a sample application but here are the details:
 In a View Controller I have the following code to show the Print Preview:
And this is invoked from a popup window action like this:
When this runs the popup window after the popup window is accepted, the popup window closes and the word 'undefined' appears in the top left of the browser window.
Is there a different way to invoke the report preview?
(I have attached a backup of my test db as well, but that is only to get the dummy report, you can create a new one called "Thing Report" if you donlt want to restore that db.)
Thanks

Do you have any suggestions?

Hi
Xamarin.Forms, XAML and Visual Studio 2017
I'm not sure if it is something related  to CodeRush or related to Visual Studio.
Until now, when I was inserting a control (like a button) in the xaml file and added an event then automatically when I was pressing the '=" (equal sign) I was prompted to press the ENTER (if I'm not mistaken) to introduce the event handler in the code behind.
Now, after some updates (Visual Studio and Code Rush) I don;t see that prompt any more, I'm just left with a code line like the following
How can I correct this and get back to the status where I was prompted to create the event handler in the code behind?

Hello,
I have a BootstrapGridView with enabled paging:
However, this only pages data on client side which is not very efficient when you have lots of rows in the grid view. My goal is to filter data (based on page number and page size) on server side, ie. inside controller method when retrieving data (eg.) from database.
Is there a way how to make a grid view to request only data for the desired page (ie. by passing page number and size to controller)?
Thanks,

The method that is described in documentation as cellValue(rowIndex, visibleColumnIndex, value) is implemented as cellValue(rowIndex, columnIdentifier, value) where the column is retrieved in cellValue() with this._columnsController.columnOption(columnIdentifier).
ColumnOption accepts the index of the column, but not the visibleIndex.
Therefore the index should be used  as argument for cellValue instead of visibleIndex.

Hello Team,
I'd like to format data in RowArea  but i've no succes !

Just reporting this issue that happens randomly both in deployed as in development versions, I'm using a DXWindow descendant opening it as a dialog and waiting for the return value.
I'm attaching two screenshots from development and below the stacktrace for the same exception coming from a user. Since it happens randomly I cannot point to where the problem lies, just rebuilding makes the problem go away, until it happens again some times. Looks like a threading issue.



Hello,
The controller works as exptected but breaks action enable status functionality in the nested listview.
I have presented the unwanted behavior in the attachment.

I have created a custom control created as above. I want the same logic to be applicable for RepositoryItemLookupEdit. I wrote below logic which works however,  I am unable to set custom properties of above control AComboList i.e. ModelName, One2ManyModel, FieldName etc.
Any advise would be highly appreciated.

I have the following routine to read Binary columns (BLOB) from an Oracle Database and concatenate the binary data into a Memory Stream and then open the Memory Stream using the ASPxRichEdit field.
Only the first column of Rich Text data is displayed in the RichEdit field.  Even though the Memory Stream length shows a total length for both columns.
The binary columns in the database include rich text data and can be opened individually using the Open method using a single binary column.  

We are having page with grid and edit layout for the grid is using model edit for the selected record. When we save the entered value in the edit layout. We are validating the same and showing message box. We are not able to retain the edit layout in model mode with value once the message box is loaded. The user have to click the grid edit again to enter the value. How do we retain the value after the message box.







I believe I found a bug in the layout algorithm of the LayoutControl. If the layout item whose label is the longest character-wise is not the longest width-wise, layout of the input control fails. It doesn't happen always and I'm afraid I can't invest more time in finding the specific circumstances.
It happens when 
is set and 
.
So on the off chance that I made a mistake, here is XAML code that produces this error.

We've written a report for a client that has a couple of parameters used to control "column" visibility.  When they turn off a column, they want the remaining columns to shift or resize to consume the empty space left by the hidden column.
I've poked around looking for something to do this, and nothing has jumped out at me.  Is there a script or non-script way to handle this?
Attached is a screenshot for reference. Imagine the client elects to turn off the "% Of Total" column.  As a result, the client wants the Total and Cost/SQFT columns to shift to the right.

Hi
Some years ago I cloned a simple DevExpress spreadsheet application  and added some of my custom functions.
I need to convert this to a dxSpreadSheet and am frankly struggling with the number of changes to be made an no obvious help in the current demos.  For example  I have a function which allows only certain values to be entered into a cell, previously I used OnEditing which from the help is defined as below, however there is no clue as to which to unit  TcxCustomEditProperties belongs.  The help below is of no use as when you click on TcxCustomEditProperties you get  'selection is not associated with any topic'
Do you have a simple dxBased Spreadhseet application from which I may be able to glean some ideas on how to convert my current cx Based application?

I have attached a sample project showing the functionality missing.
When you run the app, you will see 2 ComboBoxEdit controls:
The first has  ApplyItemTemplateToSelectedItem set to False.
The second has ApplyItemTemplateToSelectedItem set to True.
On IsMouseOver both ComboBoxEdits change their respective border's color.
On IsKeyboardFocusWithin only the first ComboBoxEdit's border changes color, while the second does not.
I wanted to know if you had any idea why this was happening? and if there was a way to fix it so the second ComboBoxEdit's border will pick up the IsKeyboardFocusWithin event?

Hi. The values of my chart's points are bounded to a list of doubles. I need to be able to stop drawing the line when the values of points are NaN, then start drawing the line again at the next point with a non-NaN double value. How can I accomplish this? When a point's value is NaN the chart doesn't draw that point, but the line continues to draw from the last valid point through to the next valid point. I see no line break.
Thanks! 

When there is a typo in the text typed in the RichTextEditor(RTE), correcting the text in the editor adds RTF control words in between the corrected text. For example if <--urlparam meber.memberId> corrected as <--urlparam member.memberId> then RTE content looks something like <!urlparam me\fs22\cf0mber.memberId>
Is there a way to remove the RTF control words from the editor content? If I want to search for the text, <--urlparam member.memberId> from the above example in the editor content how can I search ignoring the control words?

Hi,
I would create in my project a panel with a simple dashboard. My exiting project  uses normal DevExp controls. I would use dashboard items but I read in documentation that is not possible to mix in the same form standard control and dashboard items. Is it correct?
If yes,  I need to add to my DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl  a column similar to DevExpress.DashboardCommon.GridDeltaColumn provided by Dashboard Items (the  "Sales vs Target" column in the attached image).  I try to modify the grid_CustomDrawCell  but with no success.
Please, can you show me how to modify the grid_CustomDrawCell ?

Good Morning,
Original Thread:
I did a customer demo of their product in beta. Drawing on the PDF is working well as is other functionality - except rendering speed.
There was a thought presented in the above thread about a background mode for the PDFViewer - but nothing definitive.
I am now receiving pressure from my customer to speed up and smooth out the PDF rendering for AutoCAD drawings - their bread-n-butter.
Any suggestions, tweaks, or ideas would certainly be appreciated.
Also - if DevExpress is in the process of modifying the PDFViewer to address this issue - but is not ready yet for release - I would appreciate knowing that. I can use that to take some heat off of me and but us both some time.
Thank you!

Hi I am working with scheduler control i want  save the appointment using custom class . Please see attached class file where i inherits the appointment

We have a user that inserts PDF and Excel files into an Excel file.  When they edit and save the file using the MVC Spreadsheet, the embedded files are lost.  Is there a way to preserve files like these or at least indicate that there are files that will be lost when the spreadsheet is saved?

This issue was marked as fixed on ticket T233679, but I am seeing the same behavior with the latest version of the WinForm controls, 17.2.5.  I have confirmed this with ANTS Profiler.  The XtraTabPage is being kept alive by a reference from a TabControlAccessible object, even after all tab pages have been cleared.
This same behavior does not occur when using the Microsoft TabControl.

Hi,
How can I do to fix this issue:
Some grid display spcial characters correctly, but others no.   For example, the characters "?" and "?" is displayed correctly in the grid "gridComisiones", (please see the attached file) but in the grid "gridJefesSupervisores" a quiestion "?" character is displayed.
I attached web.config, my aspx page and an image to sign the issue.
Thanks in advanced! 

Hi,
Im a trying to show my uploader on a new record only - not on the edit .
this is my code but it does not work!
 

I have licanze vestion 15.2 . Can i install trial last version without problem with my licamze version?

Hi Paul,
This might be an additional ticket, but I noticed that the methods above didn't resolve the issue with scaling when there is no data present in the datagrid ("empty data row").  I did test against the project you sent back and the gridview column headers do not appear to adjust.
Thanks,
Troy 

Hi, Guys
I dont know if this happens just because i am using your trial version. 17.2.4 (Latest TRIAL) and DX 10.
I  am testing a CELL MERGED Column, and It shows pretty well in the cxGrid, but when i try to see it in the dxComponentPrinter or dxComponentPrinterLink it doesnt work.
for Example taTopJustify is working correctly in cxGrid with Cell Merge, but when you print it from the same cxGrid, then taTopJustify is ignored and taCenter is used.   
 ?

If you copy all text  and paste into richedit control, you can see it highlights it into yellow color. Can you check the problem and let us how to fix it please?

Hi Team , 
 Could you please let me know how to change the Icon for the autofilter in the WPF spreadsheetControl. Thanks

Hi
I recently just updated to the version 17.2.5 and when I run the web page, i'm getting this error:
And the code is:
@Html.DevExpress().PageControl(
        settings =>
        {
            settings.Name = "pcCallbacks";
            settings.Width = Unit.Percentage(100);
            settings.Height = Unit.Percentage(100);
            settings.TabPosition = TabPosition.Top;
            settings.EnableTabScrolling = true;
            settings.TabAlign = TabAlign.Justify;
            settings.EnableClientSideAPI = true;
 

I've seen several tickets regarding using a layoutview as the "Master" in a master/detail grid view, but I haven't found any that are the opposite.
I have it working using other views (GridView and AdvBandedGridView), but I'd like my details view to be a LayoutView. Is this possible? It shows the expand button, but clicking it does nothing when I have the layoutview set as the detail. 

Hi,
my cxGrid has a dblookupcombobox in one of its fields. However because the listsource of the dblookupcombobox has 50.000 records in it to list, it causes performance issues like slow scroll, slow open and close and so on.
Any idea how can I make it faster? 

Something in Coderush (17.2.6 and all previous versions) really slows VS 2017 down so I can only type about 1 character every 5 seconds. It seems to happen when I have a solution with about 9 projects. If I open just one project I dont see the problem as much. Any idea what's causing the problem? It makes VS utterly unuseable. If I disable Coderush everything is fine.

Hi,
I have encountered 404 Not Found problem retrieving css and javascript (.axd) asset publishing your Asp.NET Core Dasboard  under non root app url (for example

What about solution in case of Asp.Net Core Dashboard?
 

Hello there,
See in 
 the difference between my software and DevEx demo control.

    Also, how to make the 
lil bigger?
3, how can I customize the 
to be like the demo? a circle!
4, the 
has 
(0,10,15,20,25,.....), but mine doesn't?
5, how can I customize the

Hi, I have a titleview grid and I want to select the first title when the user opens the form.
I've tried to do it, using the following code:
This piece of code I've found on this post:
I've also tried to use view.MoveLast(); and view.ModeFirst() to see if the first element of my view appears selected, but without any success.
If you see in the attached prints, I have one screen with the first element selected and another with no element selected, even if I use the code above.
How can I force the grid to select and appears selected before any user interaction? 
Using the FocusedRowHandle = 0 seems to select the first element, but the element is not shown as selected.
Best regards,
Antonio.

Hi,
I am currently working with a gridcontrol in card view. When I drag one of the cards to a drop point it is removing the card from the gridcontrol. Is there a way to turn that feature off. I want to drag the card to a location and drop, but leave the card in the gridcontrol.
Thanks,

Hi,
We just upgraded to DE 17.2.5 controls. After upgrading, our gridview headerfilter checkbox labels are overlapping the checkboxes.  See the photo attached.
When I remove our custom theme, the control displays properly.  Can you help me identify which properties I need to fix in our theme?  The theme builder is a mystery to me.
CODE:

If you create a LabelControl with:
 AutoSizeModel Vertical,
MaximumSize (0, 50), 
AutoEllipsis True,
Padding.Bottom = 16,
Appearance.TextOptions.Trimming EllipsisWord (or any trimming)
and set the text to several lines or a single line which wraps enough, the top lines disappear and the bottom line overflows into the padding (which should stay blank):
I would have expected to see:
Can this be fixed?

Has this already been reported? I added a GridControl and click the Item Source Wizard. The wizard opens, but nothing happens. I can close Visual Studio, I can close any window NOT related to the Wizard. This is VERY frustrating

I have the same question as the link below but mine is asp.net webforms instead of MVC.
 
How should I solve the problem for web forms. 

We have a 32 bit application that start consuming 350mb of memory
I just tryed to make a select, that return 80000 rows
When I try to export this data to a csv file , my application get an Out of memory error, when it get over 3.5gb of consumption
There is a way to avoid this?
We are facing problems because the same select can export data with dbms tool

I am using a LookUpEdit in a cell in a GridControl with a TableView.  I need to change the border.  
With the TextEdit, I can do this using the following, and it works nicely.
How do I achieve the same result with the LookUpEdit?  The following template doesn't work.  
I've also tried setting ShowBorder="False" and BorderBrush="LightGray", with no effect.
These are both being set using a DataTemplate.

I have a ASPxSpinEdit control on a page which gets set to client.Enabled = false on the server.
it seems when someone attempts to select the text and delete it, it causes the browser to go back 1 page in history if using IE. While i'm not too worried about it because most people here use chrome (it's recommended), I do believe this may be undesirable behavior for your controls. I have not checked against edge, firefox, safari or opera.  On Chrome it works as expected, meaning nothing happens. The only time the backspace key should cause someone to go back in history is if the page is clicked (the page itself has the focus and not a control inside the page). 

I know that I can add included languages to devextreme-intl like so: 
But how do I add a new language .json file? If I have created my own `fr.json` for example where do I put it and how do I import it so that webpack includes it?
Also, I would like to provide my own `en.json` - how would I include and make sure it uses my en.json instead of the default?

I have built out a custom DataStoreBase implementation which also implements the ISqlGeneratorFormatterEx interface to handle the formatting of SQL query strings, although I have found some very strange behaviour. 
If I use the filterString "ID IN (?TargetIds)", with TargetIds being either a QueryParameter with a defined value, or a QueryParameter bound by expression to a ReportParameter, at run-time during report generation the 'TargetIds' parameter is directly subbed with a string representing its values without ANY call to the ISqlGeneratorFormatterEx functions... namely GetParameterName and FormatFunction
Upon inspection, the FormatFunction's operatorType parameter, of type FunctionOperatorType, does not include a definition for 'IN', nor does the BinaryOperatorType enum, so it appears that the use of 'IN' results in a separate code path to resolve the parameter to its values, WITHOUT making use of the ISqlGeneratorFormatterEx interface methods....
What gets stranger, is if I append additional conditions to the Filter String, for example "ID IN (?TargetIds) AND 1 = (?TargetIds)", the first condition is handled as described above, however the second condition is correctly passed and formatted by the implementation of ISqlGeneratorFormatterEx!
Is this a bug? Am I missing an interface implementation that would allow for the handling of the IN operator like all other operators? How can I ensure that the use of IN is handled and formatted like all other functions?
Many Thanks!

Hi,
I am seeing a problem with the output of a Merge Field that includes a Carriage Return Line Feed. In our scenario when there is a second address line we concatenate it with a Carriage Return and Line Feed to make one field. The attached Document has screen shots that show what we are seeing and a code snipit of the datasource being databound to the RichEdit as a list. This might be the same problem reported on T499902 RichEdit - Carriage return is incorrectly displayed on performing Mail Merge. If so, is there an ETA for this to be corrected?

I ahve BO class scans where I want add new record and attach a file to it in code like below:
but when I try to load data I get exception. This occurs because file.File is null. What I have to do while adding new record to have right value in FileData property ?

Earlier we used to sync the datatables on a Grid by using the Below code. This helped us to sync the parent child data on horizontal scroll..
After the conversion /Upgrade to 17.1.3 we are getting the below exception.
"Parameter count mismatch"
Is the method Deprecated? what is the new equivalent

Hello,
I cannot find any working example on how to confirm delete from client side. 
I wrote below code but it does nothing because once this confrimation button appears, it is too late, appoitment already deleted!
Any idea how to do this?
By the way, I can tell you that documentation on MVC Scheduler is weaker than others. It took my 2 days to add just one extra field on popup window.
 

Hi,
I have the following column defined in a DXGrid with a PopupColorEditSettings. How do I disable the hex code that accompanies the selected color? 
 

My calculated fields in Snapdocumentserver aren't loading properly. For the record, I did find this ticket: 
This seemed to have the solution, however I can't even seem to make that work.
Load attached project and click preview button. The calculated field just shows NoData.
What am I missing?
Thanks! 

Hello,
I'm using the WinUIDialogService and would like the window that contains it to be resizable.  My main goal is to have the WinUIDialog is a resizable dialog. How can I make this happen?
Thanks. 
 

I use event "EditValueChanged"  on some TextEdit to set error icon with DXErrorProvider.
But when form opening (TextEdit.EditValue is null), if I set "null" to  TextEdit.EditValue in initialization routine event doesn't fire and then error icon are not properly set.
To get around this I first set a none null value to the control, then set the real value (can be null or not). In this case event fire.
Is it a desired behavior or a bug ?

I am currently using an IDataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider to provide a dynamic MySQL connection string to clients using the web report designer. Is there a way for me to run some initial SQL statements once DevExpress uses the connection string to establish a connection?
To give some context, I am trying to run the following SQL statement after a connection is established:
SET time_zone = '<some dynamic time zone>';
Running this statement would allow each client to view timestamp fields within his/her own time zone. I've tried researching a way to run this statement as part of the connection string itself, but to my knowledge,  that is not possible.
Thanks in advance for any help your support team can provide. 

When using WhoIsWho.app.navigate({ view: 'clientesmultiview', id: undefined });
The menu is lost and is changed into an left arrow. 
See image.
How can I get the button again not the arriw
Thanks you very much
 

The ASPxHTMEditor currently strips style tags from the body.  However style tags are allowed in the body as of HTML 5.2 which is no a full recommendation.  Furthermore, style tags in the body are supported by almost all browsers.  When will you add support for style tags in the body.
Example below.
<html>
<head>
   <style>   <!-- this works -->
        .myclass { color: red; }
   <style>  
</head>
<body>
<style>  <!-- this is striped but allowed by HTML 5.2 and almost all browsers -->
      .myclass {font-weight: bold;}
</style>
 <span class="myclass">My Text</span>
</body>
</html> 

Hello, 
We have encountered a problem where changing user sessions causes an InvalidOperationException titled "Freezable Cannot Be Frozen" when a window based on the DXRibbonWindow is open. This happens when the Windows user logs out and logs back in or when a user is disconnected from a Remote Desktop Connection while the app is running. It has also been observed when the Windows DPI scaling changes. 
To replicate this issue, run the attached demo application. Sign out of the current Windows user account and sign into another. Sign out of that account and back into the first. The app should have crashed during that time.

Hi
I want to know how can i export data from a gridview  i want something simple export to pdf and excel.
thanks. 

Hi 
I have a customer requirement to specify the encoding of a text export. However, when the encoding option is specified, even with an explicit TEncoding.UTF8, the result is an ANSI file.
Since the environment is using FireDAC and the Oracle instant client , I investigated the database encoding. For this product it is UTF8. As the FireDAC parameter Characterset was blank, I specifically set this to UTF8 at designtime. This did not result in any improvement.
At one point, NotePad++ Encoding DID say UTF8, but Notepad indicates it is ANSI, as does another encoding checker I downloaded.The customer verified it was not UTF8.
Even if the data being exported was ANSI, I'd expect an explicit conversion to UTF8 from the ExportGridToText procedure.
Am I missing something here?
as an aside, the file format required is actually CSV and we abandoned the CSV-specific export some time back as we could not get ANSI from it. I tried reinstating ExportGridtoCSV, but it  a) is still ANSI and B) contains two quote characters rather than one (eg ""12"").

I have the above code for the Loaded event of my grid. However it is still calling the all get properties in the entity that are not in the gridcontrol that I am running in my viewmodel which seems to be causing a performance issue.
My app is using EF, Generated Code HyBrid and my viewmodel has InstantFeedbackCollectionViewModel.
 

  Is there an event or is it possible to create some event so that I can detect the
 PopupMenu "OnPopup" event of  "FixedDataRows"  ?

This is the code in question:
        // see which direction are they going
        XDiff = Math.Abs(line.startPosition.Point.X - line.endPosition.Point.X);
        YDiff = Math.Abs(line.startPosition.Point.Y - line.endPosition.Point.Y);
I am working on limiting the person drawing lines on the PDFViewer to orthogonal only. At issue, is that the "X" and "Y" positions are reversed.
Let me explain:
When I set a debug breakpoint just under this, and then move my mouse from left to right, AKA: the "X" axis, it is the "Y" axis that reports a change.
Conversely when I move the mouse vertically, it is showing up in the X axis - for horizontal - not the "Y" axis.
What on earth is going on?
Sincerely,
Dave

I'm following an example for creating a radiobutton column with single selection in a DevExpress gridview/control.  I understand how the code is supposed to work (using an unbound column to determine the boolean state of the selected row), but I cannot get the control/view to call my unbound column data handler.  It's very difficult for me to untangle the code from the data infrastructure, but here are the relevant bits:
Gridview creation:
            _gridView = new GridView();
            // Remove lots of options so that it's mainly just a table
            _gridView.OptionsView.ShowAutoFilterRow = false;
            _gridView.OptionsView.ShowDetailButtons = false;
            _gridView.OptionsView.ShowFilterPanelMode =
                          DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.ShowFilterPanelMode.Never;
            _gridView.OptionsView.ShowFooter = false;
            _gridView.OptionsView.ShowGroupPanel = false;
            _gridView.OptionsView.ShowIndicator = false;
            _gridView.OptionsSelection.EnableAppearanceFocusedCell = false;
            _gridView.FocusRectStyle = DrawFocusRectStyle.None;
            _gridView.CustomUnboundColumnData += CustomUnboundColumnData;
Radio column:
                _radioItem = new RepositoryItemCheckEdit();
                _radioItem.CheckStyle = DevExpress.XtraEditors.Controls.CheckStyles.Radio;
                _radioItem.EditValueChanged += RadioSelectionChanged;
                _radioColumn = new GridColumn();
                _radioColumn.Caption = "";
                _radioColumn.ColumnEdit = _radioItem;
                _radioColumn.OptionsFilter.AllowFilter = false;
                _radioColumn.MaxWidth = 20;
                _radioColumn.UnboundType = DevExpress.Data.UnboundColumnType.Boolean;
                _radioColumn.Visible = true;
                _gridView.Columns.Add(_radioColumn);
It creates a gridcontrol with the above view and a 'regular' DataTable containing static row data that is added based on other operations.   It calls _gridView.RefreshData() anytime a new row is added to the data table.
However, my CustomUnboundColumnData handler is never called.  So, unfortunately, I can't handle the dynamic retrieval and binding of the unbound radio button changes.   The RadioSelectionChanged call does occur (just calls _gridView.PostEditor()) and the radio buttons are there, it just seems that the unbound data mechanism is broken for no apparent reason...
 

I would like to be able to change the columns of the GridControl according to the the data that is being pushed into it  using MVVM. I have created an example of what I am trying to accomplish I hope this helps. Thanks in advance.
 

I am using Chart Control having more than two series of data to be plotted as Line Chart. Some of the series have same valued data hence their lines are overlapped with the one which is added later to graph. 
I need to increase the thickness of the line which is overlapped by other in case of any overlapping so that both(can be more) the lines are visible. But I want to keep the thickness same if there is no overlap.

Hi,
I  have been looking into XtraReports for quite some time to replace our Crystal Report based reporting platforms. However, till recent times, XtraReport was lacking some critical features which prevented us from doing so. I am now again evaluating XtraReport after coming to know of the latest developments. While doing so I am finding some issues which are "critical" and some which are "good to have". As a software organization developing products, I know that collating multiple issues in a single ticket would be difficult for support tracking but you can split the questions into different tickets if you wish.
We used Crystal Report primarily for Invoice designing for our end users. Every customer of ours request a customized format suited to their business needs. The number of layout customization requests handle by our services team is at least 50-100 per month. 
In our software, the invoice data is generated as a .net dataset at runtime by our reporting service routine (sometimes from tables, views or stored procedures/functions) with all transactions and related masters populated in the same dataset. Our current RPTs do not connect directly to the database but is designed with an XML (dataset based) and is supplied a live dataset (of the same structure) at runtime. All reports work with same dataset structure, only at runtime the live dataset is supplied in the ReportDocument.DataSource property (Crystal Report).
1. 
 - As our conventions, we export ADO.NET DataSets  with sample data and schema (DataSet.WriteXML with Schema option) to XML files. This enables us to design the reports in Crystal Report offline but at the same time view the data in preview mode, right from the designer. Similarly, I have tried using the same XML here as an XML data source and loaded the same into the XtraReport. The tables were populated but the DataRelations were not populated. But in Crystal the relations are also populated. It will be very difficult for us to recreate the data relations every time an XML is loaded, since we keep customizing quite a few Invoice layouts every month. Am I missing something which is preventing the DataRelation from being loaded? I did not try the load only the schema (XSD) as mentioned in 
 since I believe that would prevent me from seeing the loaded sample data in offline design mode in the previewer.
2. 
- When I am creating a Calculated Field, and subsequently trying to map the field to a label, through 
, I cannot find the field from 'Search'. For example I have created a calculated field named [v_Report_POSBill].[f_heading] which is not showing up when I am searching 'f_heading'. Tried different ways of searching, but it does not show up.
3. 
- It is very inconvenient for developers to search for calculated fields from a single tree node. while trying to drag them into the design . The 'Field List', irrespective of wherever it shows up, e.g. as a tabbed window 
or from 
 can't we have a separate tree where all the calculated fields are shown under a single hierarchy. I am using 27 datatables and it is very difficult to track under which tables I have the Calculated Fields. Please give a separate hierarchy where all such fields will be displayed under one node in addition to their positions in actual source table hierarchy. It will be very easy to track how many Calculated Fields I have created and drag and drop / binding will be very easy. Refer arrangement of formula fields of Crystal Report for this.
4. 
 - It is very convenient for the developer to view the underlying data while designing the report. Crystal Report has a View Data option where data for each field can be displayed. Every field should have a view data option and if not the 'Calculated Fields' but at least the Data Source tables, and direct table.column bound fields should have the option for 'View Data'. Yes, you can ask for a 'Limit' for design time fetching of data (e.g. 10 records, or ask from user). This helps immensely for offline designers (using XML files) since often you might need to look at the underlying data shape before you apply any formatting or create a formula (Calculated Field).
Hope you will address the critical issues with urgency.
Thanks in advance.

helo,
i have a problem.
when i create role navigation permission, appears error while saving data.
how to handle it.??
screenshoot, see attachment.
thank you.

I am trying to alter the background colour of a row based on the contents of one field.  The grid is populated from a datatable without the fields being defined at design time.
The datatable will not contain any more than about a maximum of 50 rows and 6 columns, mostly less than 20 rows. 
In the code below, I am checking the one column for the value -1.  Only one row will ever have that value and will usually be the second row but I don't want to assume the data will remain like that so I want to look for it when the grid is displayed.
Can you give me an idea of why the code below does not work?  Thank you.
 

Dear DevExpress Support Team,
After successfully upgrading my ASP.NET Core Bootstrap to the latest version (v17.2.5) , I tried to install NuGet Package "DevExpress.AspNetCore.Bootstrap" to v17.2.5 many times, but never success (the Error Message can be seen in the attached file). It would be very much appreciated, if you could help me solve this problem.

Hi,
Could you tell me what the equivalent is in WInforms of how I print in ASP .NET?
Basically I have the Report and I want to only display a PrintDialog to the user when they're ready to print, I don't need to display the PDF.
Thanks for your help, Jack
This is the code I use in ASP .NET Page_Load:
Dim r As New XtraReport()
r = CType(Session("MechReport"), XtraReport)
Using ms As New MemoryStream()
r.CreateDocument()
Dim opts As New PdfExportOptions() With {
.ShowPrintDialogOnOpen = False
}
r.ExportToPdf(ms, opts)
ms.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin)
Dim report() As Byte = ms.ToArray()
Page.Response.ContentType = "application/pdf"
Page.Response.Clear()
Page.Response.OutputStream.Write(report, 0, report.Length)
Page.Response.End()
End Using
 
 

Hi, we've got the following code that compiled in D7, but in D10.2.2 Tokyo, the references to 
[...] is returning an error E2003: Undeclared identifier: Values
I can't tell exactly what's going on from the source unit cxSchedulerStorage, so perhaps you can tell me how to refer to this property?
It's not clear if it's referring to an event or a field or what exactly.
        if AItem.Parent is TcxSchedulerReportEventCell then
        begin
          vRecordIndex := TcxSchedulerReportEventCell(AItem.Parent).Data;
          vPatNameIndex := Storage.CustomFields.Items[cPT_NAME].Index;
          vReasonIndex := Storage.CustomFields.Items[cST_DESC].Index;
          vFGColorIndex := Storage.CustomFields.Items[cFONT_COLOR].Index;
          vBGColorIndex := Storage.CustomFields.Items[cBKGND_COLOR].Index;
          vLockedByIndex := Storage.CustomFields.Items[cLOCKED_BY].Index;

[vRecordIndex, vChkdInIndex]) + ' ';
 

We've got this code fragment that's compiling under D7, but under DX10.2.2 Tokyo, it's throwing an error saying RecordIndex is not decleared.
Either it has been renamed or moved under another object. 
Can you tell me how to fix this?

VCL PivotGrid desperately need a new features. Last new feature for PivotGrid was in Build 16.2 -> OLAP Support.
I think this year PivotGrid should improved its performance such as Loading time, Filtering, slide & dice.

Hi Support team,
I am a beginner and on my way going through the XAF tutorials.
Now I want to change the given Base Class Library, like described here:
But how to e.g. delete the MiddleName in Person.cs or the StateProvince in Address.cs? Of course I can edit the file Person.cs, but then I run into a problem where I cannot proceed. 
Because I cannot change the corresponding class PersonImpl  and the interface IAddress. How to add fields to that classes and interfaces?
How to deal with that restriction? Or should I better build all my domains from scratch instead of modifying yours?
Btw. what is the reason to have this "shadow" class PersonImpl or AddressImpl?
Thanks Florian

Hi Support Team,
I am new to XAF / XPO  and studying your tutorials and examples.
Two questions came up, where I hardly find an answer:
Some of your XPO class definition examples have private fields with  public properties:
Others only have public fields?
What's recommended in general? Do there is any difference in how the application or database will behave?
The other question is: 
I have, that in your examples and Business Class Library  you never use the [Size(n)] annotation for string fields, which results in a nvarchar(100) field in a MS SQL Database. Why? How I can change the size and datatype to varchar?
I will have very big tables in future where size matters... 
Thanks Florian

Is there a way to set column width based on headers. I tried everything I could think of, but it's always to wide or it clips the header. Also, I'm unable to make best fit to work. No matter what I do, all the columns are the same size (except for those with set width). Also, I would love to stay away from code behind if possible (ideally all in xaml). Thanks

I am using a datebox inside a form as follows:




How can I get the date format as "dd-MM-yyyy" for the same. Also, how can I validate if the "from" date is older than the "to" date by using separate dateboxes?



I have same problem as described in the 
 ticket, is it solved ?
I'm using version 17.2.5, do you have any sample project in 17.2.5 for this problem ?

Hi,
I have implemented trigger for the Row element. But I am facing some issues:
1) I am not able to change the text color on the Mouse Over event.
2)  The background color gets changed in sometime automatically. This could be because as I can notice if I remove the background color setter, a gray background comes by default. So, this could be the reason why the background color gets changes as it gets mixed with gray. But I am not able to remove the default gray color.
Please refer the screenshot and code. Please let me know if you need more info on this. 
  

Hi DevExpress team,
I have a Multichannel app and I built a Web Api OData Service to use as a source for an ODataContext (Web API instead of Wcf because I need to use DTOs). 
I used the DevExtreme Web API OData Service Template, and so far as I can see the necessary CORS support is already implemented there and should not lead to any problems. But when I actually use the service in my app, I get an unspecified network error; when I use dx.all.debug.js instead of dx.all.js I get an error telling me that CORS support is missing.
This seems very strange, especially because the actual GET request returns 200 Ok and the expected objects in the response body. Also, there is no error in the web console. I tried to set breakpoints in the errorFromResponse and interpretJsonFormat functions in the dx.all.debug.js to maybe find out more about the error, but the error message appears before the breakpoints are actually hit.
1. Is there some CORS support still missing in the template, or is the error message misleading, considering the success of the actual GET request?
2. Could you give me some hints on how I can find out more about where this error is coming from?

Hello,
I use a custom property editor(ASPxCombobox) which is inherited from ASPxObjectPropertyEditorBase, I've implemented a custom filtering for this editor by using ItemsRequestedByFilterCondition and ItemRequestedByValue events.
Filtering does not work correctly when searching with some Turkish characters, these characters are '?' and '?'.
For example if I have this following objects
- TEST KL??E
If i type 'test kli?e', i should find this item. 'i' is the lowercase and '?' is the uppercase in Turkish.
Same for '?' letter
- TEST FIRM
I should find this item if i type 'test f?rm'.    
If you need to debug and see this issue, I've attached a small sample project. You can search these 2 objects(MT_Firm objects) above in MT_Proposals. 
I've found a ticket(T566399) which is similar to this issue and tried this solution in my case but it didn't work.
Can you suggest a solution for this issue please ?
Regards.

I have a ASPxGridView with a GridViewDataDateColumn. This column has a header filter with a date-range (from - to).
 
How do I get (or set for that matter) those from/to values from my codebehind?
Currently I read the columns filterexpression and extract the dates with a regular expression, but I suspect that there's a better way of doing it, but I can't find any from/to property.
Thank you!

Hi,
yesterday I created a theme based on "Office 2016 White".  Basically I just added 3 colors to the palette and applied them just on 2 controls.
Today I wanted to continue my work on the theme, but it looks like all colors have changed to random values.
Please have a look at the attachment. It shows the 3 colors I've added and it shows the CardView as example.
Yesterday the Card View looked like it should, based on Office 2016 White, today it looks like just random colors.
Basically all views look like Card View. Tinted to a weird blue.
Actually it makes the theme designer  unusable. 

Hello,
I have the following scenario: 
I'm using a Grid Control, that displays properties of a model. The Grid Control contains a Cell Template for one of the Grid Columns, where I'm using a Data Template to  add more UI Controls in that Column( Image + Text Edit Controls). When I'm in EditFormShowing Mode, I would like to disable the ability to write to the TextEdit control of that GridColumn. In order to do that I've added a IsReadOnly boolean to the model, binded that to the TextEdit IsReadOnly property and then I've captured the event "EditFormShowing" of the TableView, and tried to set the IsReadOnly property to true for the current Selection, but this does not have any effect, only after I click the update button of the Edit Form ...when obviously it's to late.
How should I fix this ? I wany my custom cell template to be readonly when the EditForm is active, just how it is working for the other columns, where I didnt make any custom UI displaying.
I have attached the working project with the problem that I've described here.
Best Regards,
Olteanu Radu

Hello DevExpress team,
Small description of my situation. I want to add some data attributes to the toolbar item, so i can obtain them in a ToolbarItemClicked event on a client.
This is how i add my toolbar items as a 
:
I'm using the TextTemplate for the subitem, where i add my data attributes to the rendered caption.
On the client i handle the ToolbarItemClicked event. I have the current menu item (ASPxClientMenuItem), but i didn't find a way to get its html in order to get the data attributes (via JQuery, for example).
The menu object though has the GetMainElement() method, so I have tried to get at least the ASPxClientMenuItem.menu (an then maybe find my attribute via jquery), but i get the top 
menu in this case. And my 
is not even a child of the toolbar menu (in html).
In theory, i would like to have in typescript smth like this:
Is it possible to achieve it somehow?
Thank you,
Aleksandr.

Hello.
Yesterday I experienced this confusing experience, a combolookupedit, which no longer activated its behavior of change of value! As I have just resolved this situation, I want to share the cause of this situation that I find strange.
I use a repository lookupedit to fill a full-time, column from a large list of value, however, when you need to make an entry, the list of values   is less. So I use CustomNodeCellEdit mecanism, to determine the display repository (wide list), CustomNodeCellEditForEditing to specify, according to the type of line, the appropriate lookupedit, with the appropriate data (reduced list).
As I manage data rights, I consider the author of the information, and the user currently logged in, for or against the change. And I thought it was enough that the management of the readonly is only dedicated to the editing repository! But after research on this blocking behavior, where no modification is possible, I can say, that this is not the case.

Hello team, 
  I should create spreadsheet during runtime to meet customers needs.
  but I stuck on how to create menu bar. 
  I saw one ticket before. (but now I can't find it.. sorry..)
  If I want to use the existing menu (like in the attachment, FormatNumberDecreaseDecimal button)
  then I should  follow up the designer code. 
  Anyway, I tried to do it but it draws the menu and icon as well
  however, button is not working. 
  (plz check WATCHME.gif! try put 0.9281 and click the FormatNumberDecreaseDecimal button) 
 [Attached solution, VS 2013] 
  Design project - I add menu with design mode. 
  Trial project - It's my trial to imitate the design code.
I hope the FormatNumberDecreaseDecimal works and I can create the menu by code.
thank you in advance. 

Hi Team,

Hello
I have a question to the layout of the print-Output from XtraScheduler-control to the daily-appointment-print:
A user has made me aware that the time information is no longer in line. Thus, it is sometimes difficult to read the schedule times easily.
Please see the attached Image - you can see , that the time-line and time-setting of (for example) 13 is the 00 under the 13. 
In previous versions (or in the online-documentation) was the full-time-indication in one line.
Is it possible to change a s etting or property for this time-indication?
Many thanks in advance for your help & best regards,

We have an unbound column acting as expression column. How can we order the Column names in the expression editor?

Hello support,
I have following problem with custom filtering. In the sample I have three objects - MyObject, MySecondObject and TreeNode. The TreeNode shows tree structure in MasterDetailView (list and detail view) and each node has property "DataObject" which is of type MyObject. MyObject has property, which references MySecondObject. MySecondObject has bool property called "IsTrue", according to which I'd like to filter the MySecondObject's list views - I'd like to see only instances, which have property IsTrue set to true.
I have created a ViewController, which applies filter to list views and nested list views of MySecondObject and it works fine when viewing the list view of MySecondObject or opening nested list view of property from MyObject. My problem is here - when I'm viewing TreeNode MasterDetailView and looking at DataObject, I'd like to change MySecondObject it references. Here I need the filter not to apply.
I was thinking about possible solution of going from the nested list view up, by finding its parent detail view and going further up, to see If i could find detail view of TreeNode and, by this I would clear the filter manually. In the said controller, I'm able to access the parent detail view, but I'm not able to go further up. And since it is the same nested list view as the one when viewing from the detail view of MyObject, I don't know if I can differentiate between those two and apply the filter only to the correct one or remove it.
So I'd like to ask if there is any way of solving this problem.
I have attached sample project and screenshot, which demostrates this situation.
Thank you for your help.

Ahh yes that was it sorry. I was 17.1 now I upgraded to 17.2.3

Hello. 
Within my XAF solution, there will be no data shown direct after program start.
When i change the sort-mode, which is set to [oid  last - first] to [oid first -last] all records are shown.
Now i change agait to [oid  last - first] and the use key [Pos1] (may by [Home]) to go to the first entry in the list.
How can I change the behavior to change the data displayed in the sort order and the first record (highest oid) is selected directly after the program start?

The first launch of a report it's taking a long time. 
But the problem occurs every time.
For exemple, we have an application with 2 reports.
The scenario we encounter is the following :
- Launch the application
- Preview report 1 : it takes 10 seconds to show the report preview.
- Close the preview
- preview the report 1 again : it takes 1 second to show the preview
- close the preview
- preview the report 2 : it takes 5 seconds
- close the preview
- preview the report 2 again : it takes 0.5 second.
- close tha application
- launch the application again
- Preview report 1 : it takes 10 seconds to show the report preview.
- Close the preview
- preview the report 1 again : it takes 1 second to show the preview
- and so on ...
Our application is a XAF application.
Will Ngen improve the performance of the 1st preview/print ?
What is the difference between printing report 1 and report 2. Aren't the DLL already compiled at the first preview of report ?
Many thanks in advance for your answer.

As demonstrated in the example solution, when using a RepositoryItemDate Edit column edit to edit a date stored in string format the editor switches to EN-US date format and back to EN-GB format swapping the month and day values and blanks where the day is greater than 12.
My DateTime is  provided to the GridControl as a string because I allow different editors per row meaning it could be a number or a text string being edited but in this simple example it is always a date.
Notice that, assuming you are running using the EN-GB culture and your date is displayed as "dd/MM/yyyy ", you will see in the grid two rows. The first shows blank in gridColumn2 where it should show 18/02/2018 and the second row shows 02/12/2018 where it should show 12/02/2018.
Now try and edit the first rows date  via the drop down calendar. It shows the 18th February correctly. Click on it and it is displayed now in the grid. But when you click out of the cell it goes blank again.
Edit the second rows date in the drop down calendar and it correctly shows  12th February and when you click on the 12th it shows the correct format in the cell but when you click on another cell it flips back to US format and shows 02/12/2018.
This is clearly a bug somewhere.
So I tried to fix the format as dd/MM/yyyy in my data source  but that has no effect.
If I use a DateTime instead of a string then it works fine so it's the code that takes a string and tries to convert it into the display format that is forcing the US date culture instead of the threads culture which is GB. 
Can you recommend a working solution or do I have to write my own RepositoryItemDateEditThatWorksInCulturesOtherThanUS class?
Many thanks,
 Malcolm. 

Hello Dear Andrey,
I implemented what you say, and it is working but another problem is that; The value I selected by filtering, if a second filter does not contain that value, the filter I first selected disappears. I attached a video which i described.
Thanks for your help and support.

Hi Support,
I am binding the Scheduler to an Observable collection of my appointment class retrieved from SQL.  There are two bools in my class (IsNew and IsDirty) for tracking what needs to be saved. After handling the AppointmentsUpdated event I send the collection off to be saved. Afterwards I set all items in the list to false for IsNew and IsDirty on a successful save. 
Trying to set the two bools is generating a NullReference exception and based on research it appears the scheduler disposes the items after binding to the list. 
My questions are:
Is it possible to switch this behaviour off ? 
or
Is there an event where I can detect when there is a change of appointment or  a new appointment as I don't want to refresh the whole list every time an appointment is added or changed just to reset the IsNew and IsDirty bools. 
or
Is the scheduler supposed to be used in a different way?
Thank you. 

Hi,
I have a DataGrid with PopUp edit. 
I wan't to be able to validate if a user is free in the selected time period. I have created a method to do that, but it is on the serverside. Is it possible to create a similar method like that in JavaScript? Where I can compare the dates, and check if the user is used in another project at that time. If so, which method should I call?
If not, then how can I show the error message from server?
The ValidationErrorMessage is never shown. I've read 
, maybe a similar solution could work? (i'm using MVC, not api)
Hope you can help :-)

Hello DevExpress,
I want to make it possible to drag and drop a recurrence appointment from 1 resource to another . Then an exception(changed occurence) must be created. In the schedulerControl_AppointmentsInserted event I get two objects, a deleted one and a new appointment of a Normal type. I want this Normal type be a appointment of ChangedOccurrence type with the index of the deleted appointment. 
When I want to create the exception an error occured with an invalid recurrenceindex. 
 

Hello,

My problem is now that I can't choose any MarkerModel in my PropertyGridControl.
What have I done wrong?

Hi Support,
Like in WinForm we are using your 'StateIndicator' component in normally.  But in Devextreme HTML-JS i have not fond the same. I mean can it possible in your Web platform as well ?
I will be happy if you would please share me a solution on this.  My requirement is, i have a HTML Input element, which gives me the Value as in True or False. I want If the Input value is True, then the StateIndicator will show GREEN, if False then the StateIndicator will show RED simply.

Hi, I have a problem with Mail Merge function: I want to load an html document into a RichEditControl and apply some mergefields.
In the same time I apply the mergefield, the "view merged data" function works correctly, but, after saving the html document and reload it, I can see only the original filed name between "<<" and ">>" and the "view merged data" stops working.
Is this behaviour correct?
Thanks 

Another problem discovered in new version. ScrollBox is useless in current release. Scroll bars are not present on runtime. This is expected behaviour with new style scrollbars but there is no way how to make them functional. Sometimes they appear for split second but when moving mouse from outside of box into box but it's not usable.
See attached sample project compiled with 16.2.5 (correct) and 17.2.4 (wrong)

Hello,
I'm using DevExtreme.AspNet.Data package (latest version 1.4.0-rc1) to transform data on server before sending it to dxDataGrid on frontend. 
On one of the screens I have a large dataset with over 180 columns and group summaries for over 160 columns.
Unfortunately currently DevExtreme.AspNet.Data does not support such a large amount of summaries: "Too many type arguments" exception is thrown.

Hi 
Please find demo attached.
In scheduler you will see Budget and Journal section for a date. In which Red  one is non editable and green one is editable.
And you can not move task from budget column to journal column. you can do editing and adding in only Budget column. 
You can do anything with task in Journal column. Now this is how the demo works.
Now I am looking to just copy and paste Red one task to Budget section and 
Ability to move task from Journal-column by dragging a journal entry to the Budget-column. And the one we copy should exist there.
Its like a copy of Journal-column task.
How to achieve this. Can you make changes in demo.
And one more thing how we using keyboard copy and paste task/ or any other options you provide in your control?
Thanks

Hello,
I am using AutoFilterByColumn to set filter to a gridview column. However there is no reverse method to reverse the filtering to previous state, aka removing the Auto Filter from a specific Column.
I can use grid.AutoFilterByColumn("Field",null) but i suggest adding a new clientside method to make it easier.
Take it as a suggestion.
Thanks

Hello,
I have a SideBySideGantt chart and I want to display the full datetime for the Two Labels option.
I am aware that I can change the text pattern, but that overrides the possibilty to display two different labels for the same bar.

Hi Team,
I'm trying to implement the following feature, but I would like to get your advise how to approach it.
Here's a description of a sample task:
I have a PivotGrid with orders. Execution date field is in the column area, price and quantity are in the data area and Client name is in row area.
So the grid shows the amount of products and their prices ordered by a client on a particular date.
What I want to achieve is to show the difference between the  current and the previous date value (the delta) for each field instead of showing the actual values. E.g.
instead of this:
             Order Date
             |      01-01-2018  ||  10-01-2018      ||  15-01-2018      |
             | Quantity | Price || Quantity | Price || Quantity | Price |
Client1 |   100       |  300  ||   150       |  400  ||  50         |  100   |
I want to have this:
             Order Date
             |      01-01-2018  ||  10-01-2018      ||  15-01-2018      |
             | Quantity | Price || Quantity | Price || Quantity | Price |
Client1 |   100       |  300  ||   
|  
||  -
|  -
|
*the numbers explanation: 
 = 150 - 100 | 
 = 400 - 300 | 
 = 50 - 150 | 
 = 100 - 400 
Please see the screenshot as well.
I guess I could do this in CustomCellValue event handler, but I'm not sure how to access the other data outside of the current DrillDownDataSource.
Any help would be greatly appreciated . Thanks!

Hi,
it is possible to sort the  Row and Column fields in the dashboard designer.
Wondering if there is a way for an end user to change  sort mode in the dashboard viewer. With a normal grid this does work, but within the pivot in seems impossible ?
Also there is no way to sort by Value field.
Since the idea of a dashboard is that the end user shoud be able to easily see management information this would be a necessary feature ?
 I have found a ticket which is over 2 years old with the same question, but it is still not implemented...
Thanks

Hello,
I am taking reference to this ticket: 
After testing and some in-depth debugging I have figured out what the problem is:
When you create a custom Palette using the DevExpress "PaletteEditorForm", the read-only ScaleMode property is set to the "Repeat" value.
However, this value should be "Extrapolate" to allow for color gradation.
The only way I know about how to fix this problem is to change the property in the CXP file to the desired value afterwards.

Basic question but im trying to line up controls and hoping theres an easy way.
 I want My button to be lined up with the date fields.

Hi,
I'm trying to get the filtered or the non filtered items of a ComboBoxEdit.
Here is a small example.
So, what I want to do now is to query either the filtered(everything except 5) or the non filtered items(5).
Any idea?
 

 is an example of code to highlight matches, we changed it a little:
But the problem is, text is trimmed and ellipsis is displaying sometimes. See

How can we never see ellipsis but always full text even when searching?

Hi
This piece of code causes the program to slow down 
When this code is turned off, the program starts quickly. Why?
In previous versions there were no problems

I would Like to display multiple Graphs in a Report. But I am facing the Issue that  same Graph repeats for each element in first element of the List.
example: My datasource is a list of Products, so I have 2 items in this Products List. Each Item in this has a List of child Items say{ x,y}
I have to show in my report that first Item graph with its {x,y} list, and second graph with its list of {x,y}
List<Products>{
                         [0]{ (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),(x4,y4)},
                         [1]{ (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),(x4,y4),(x5,y5)}
                        }
But issue is that graph for [0]th item appears number of times of its items. the [1] item will not appear (when I put the graph under detail slab). 
expectation is to get one graph for each item [0]th and [1] and so on.


For instance, it is impossible to specify the {V:MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss} format to format both labels at once.

Please see the attached sample, where you can reproduce the problem. When a template is settled in a helper class, a exception is throw.
Simply run the project and expand the first node.

Open the customization-window by right click on any column and click on "column chooser". The popup with the gridview is now hidden.
This is since v17.2.5 

Hi.
I have several GV:s where I have  comboboxfields. The comboboxes are filled with items from a SQL-datasource.
This works exellent.
But now I have the same situation with one difference: The combobox items are filled from a SQL-datasource that is connected to another database than the datasource for the gridview.
I also works but the value instead of the text is shown  in this field in grid collapsed mode and also in edit mode.
The combobox shows the list of texts, selection is possible and the right value is stored.
But it will always display the value and not the text.
This only happens in this situation, with the items coming fron another database.
I have checked and double checked the settings and they are similar to tha other cases when this works ok.
Especially the VaueType is checked (both Value and Text are strings in this case)
Is the different database the problem here?

Hello,
I want to have, and so I'm thinking about propertygrid, a grid to edit object properties, some properties are boolean, others string... but I need to have one column more  with a checkedbox to allow to the end-user to apply or not the property change to the bound object.
Do you have a solution ?

Hi,
I'm writing a Winforms application following the MVVM pattern. I have a main form using a main view model.

Hi,
when loading a CSV or Excel file to ExcelDataSource, I have an issue.
The first column of the Excel/Csv file is called "#ID" and it contains mostly a number, but few of values has a "#" in front of the number (e.g. #123).
After loading the file, the PropertyDescriptor of the column shows, that the PropertyType is set to Double instead of String (as I would expect because of the "#" in some values).
This leads to Errors later on (I get a DataTable from the ExcelDataSource and try to add an additional column to the DataTable with an Expression, which uses the #ID column).
Is there a recommended way to handle the Data Type issue ?
Here is the source code used:
// Get the ExcelDataSource from File
public static ExcelDataSource GetExcelDataSource(string filePath, string sheet)
{
 ExcelDataSource excelDS = new ExcelDataSource();
 excelDS.FileName = filePath;
 ExcelSourceOptionsBase options = null;
 if (filePath.ToLower().EndsWith(".csv"))
    options = new CsvSourceOptions() { DetectEncoding = true, DetectNewlineType = true, DetectValueSeparator = true };
 else
    options = new ExcelSourceOptions(new ExcelWorksheetSettings(sheet));
 excelDS.SourceOptions = options;
 excelDS.Fill();
 return excelDS;
}
// Extension method to get DataTable from ExcelDataSource
public static DataTable ToDataTable(this ExcelDataSource excelDS)
{
 IList list = ((IListSource)excelDS).GetList();
 DevExpress.DataAccess.Native.Excel.DataView dataView = (DevExpress.DataAccess.Native.Excel.DataView)list;
 List<PropertyDescriptor> props = dataView.Columns.ToList<PropertyDescriptor>();
 DataTable table = new DataTable();
 for (int i = 0; i < props.Count; i++)
 {
    PropertyDescriptor prop = props[i];
    table.Columns.Add(prop.Name, prop.PropertyType);
 }
 object[] values = new object[props.Count];
 foreach (DevExpress.DataAccess.Native.Excel.ViewRow item in list)
 {
    for (int i = 0; i < values.Length; i++)
    {
       values[i] = props[i].GetValue(item);
    }
    table.Rows.Add(values);
 }
 return table;
}
// Then an additional column "ID" is created which gets the value from "#ID" 
string formulaFromUnboundColumn = "Iif(StartsWith([#ID], '#'), Substring([#ID], 1), [#ID])";
CriteriaOperator co = CriteriaOperator.Parse(formulaFromUnboundColumn);
string expression = CriteriaToWhereClauseHelper.GetDataSetWhere(co);  // iif(([#ID] like '#%'), Substring([#ID], (1) + 1, Len([#ID]) - (1)), [#ID]
dataTable.Columns.Add("ID", "String", expression); 
-> Exception {"Cannot perform 'Like' operation on System.Double and System.String."}

Hello,
I'm trying to remove the "All" value in a ComboBox filter and select an unique initial value to show into the ComboBox. 
After this, the user can check one or more values, but the initial state needs to start with one value.
Thank you!

How can I exclude a region from serializing it's state during the Save? 
Disabling the DXSerializer is not working.

I'm trying to develop a custom GroupControl, where a specific header button is available by default, and a specific event is fired when that button is clicked.
I've tried to do this by using inheritance, see following code:
Now, when I add this control to a 
 whose 
property is 
, and I switch between languages, every time I switch language this custom button (reset) keeps getting added to the CustomHeaderButtons of the GroupControl. In other words, after switching between 5 different languages, the reset button is duplicated 5 times.
Previously, before overriding `CreateButtonCollection`, I used the designer of FilterPanel to add the custom button, but this resulted in the same problem.
I hope the problem is clear from my description, if you need screenshots or other information please let me know.
Thanks in advance.

Hi,
We are using a PivotGrid in our application and we have noticed that when setting the data source (SetDataSourceAsync), the pivot grid is retrieving the data of all the properties defined in the data source, 
.
We have some properties defined in our data source aimed to relate a row in the grid to a business object in our application, in order to, for instance, display its properties when selected, but they are not displayed as they are not bound to any column in the grid.
The problem we are having with this is that it is causing a big impact in performance, as it is, recursively retrieving all the properties of this business object (exposed as a property) in our data source.
So the question is: How can we prevent the pivot grid to retrieve data for a specific property in the data source?. We have tried several things with no success, among them:
- Decorating the property with: [Display(AutoGenerateField = false)]
- Setting the pivotGrid.OptionsData.RetrieveNestedFields to  DefaultBoolean.False
-  ...
Any clue?
Thanks in advance,
Carlos. 

Hi Team,
We are using DXTabcontrol, we haven't applied any Theme for it. But after execution default Theme is getting applied. Later we have declared dx:ThemeManager.ThemeName="None" , however we are able to see the default theme.We don't want theme to be applied for TabControl. Is it possible to remove default theme for a particular control?
Please check the attached screenshot.

Hi Dev Ex,
I know this is possible i have a gri dcontrol that i load via Datatable and I want to insert an image on the last row, my image is stored as byte in the database. 
How can i accomplish this task .
Can I insert image on datatable and  show it in DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl ?

Hello,
I'm trying to follow these instructions without success:
 
But when there's an image and a dropdown arrow they get overlapped (see the root node).
I'm attaching a demo Project , can you help me?

In the past, I've been using 2 TcxImagelist components to contain all my toolbar button images in 16x16 and 24x24 resolution, about 200 images each.
 After I noticed that DevExpress supports SVG images, I replaced about 95% of the images by SVG graphics.
As a result, the loading time of the datamodule  that contains the imagelists increased from below 1 second to more than 7 seconds.
As far as I understand, each SVG gets converted to a bitmap, when the application starts, even if the bitmap is not used on startup.
That explains the increase of the loading time. 
Is there a better solution than changing all bitmaps back to BMPs? 

I have a custom column which has a drop down and a clear button.
 However, in the UI the buttons for this column appear with the dropdown button to the left of the clear button. Is there any way I can get this order flipped? I'm just trying to provide a quick way for users to clear the active selection of the combobox.

For my PropertyGridControl I want to be able to set custom editors per row at runtime. Therefore, I set them during the CustomDrawRowValueCell event. However, this prevents the UI from updating/drawing automatically.
The appended example shows the problem. Changing the properties should show/hide the legend or the title of the chart.
 I am guessing I am missing a certain event?

Is it possible to change the type of a row filter for a DateTime column to something more similar to a slider that we get on the numeric columns?
My use case is on this particular column we always sort on a date range - while I know you can construct that in the existing filtering options - was hoping there was a more simple way to filter similar to the slider on the numeric fields.
Thanks,

Hi There,
I have a generic Dashboard Web Page which creates and displays specific Dashboard. I need to limit the Stored Procedure shown,  as I have sensitive SP not to be displayed, by user that will be able to create the dashboards themself. For example only allow SP with the key word "sp_Dashboard". 
Is this a possible solution with your system?
Eagerly awaiting your reply

Hello
I have a strange problem, but I can't reproduce it in sample project. I also cutted my project to have simple objects, but still can't reproduce...
So, could you tell me how could I debug this? I need to understand why does the protected content appear and disappear in this case (see video)?
Totally my problem is opening by popupWindowShowAction an persistent obect to create it (instead of new button). But first time it is show protected content even at bool property. If I once open this object with rowView or new/addPerson button, then it open well without protectedContent till I change view (go to another list and open Registration detail again).
What could I check to understand what is cause of this? Or maybe you could suggest to check/change something?
This is simple opening popupWindowShowAction handler:

Hi.
I'm working with the gridview, and wanted to add some drag-drop row functionality. This led me to the following example of using the behaviormanager to manage drag-drop functionality (
) 
After adding the behavior manager into my app, the mousedown was firing twice every time I mouse-downed.  This is a problem because I have special logic that needs to happen in mousedown, and having it fire twice is an issue.
I took the example supplied, and added a mousedown handler, and: 
Even in the example, it fires mouedown twice.  Put a breakpoint at line 22 to see what's happening. 
Please help! 


                                This example demonstrates how to restrict the 
 navigation to display seven days, Saturday and Sunday excluded. 
To accomplish this, the project implements a custom 
 to handle the left and right arrow keys. Navigation commands execute custom methods defined in ViewModel. Commands are replaced with methods using the 
property and 
 binding introduced in the DevExpress MVVM Framework . 
A custom set of days is assigned to the 
 property. 
The project handles the 
 event to adjust visible dates if a view's visible intervals are changed with a method other than the navigation commands.

                            

Hi,
I want to use DxDataBox with two way bindings. I think there is an error. I copied your demo to plunker and changed some code.

A 
 docked as MDI document to a 
 with 
 property set to false can't be docked into another 
. Changing this behavior should make 
 with 
 usage more convenient.

I am facing an issue with the PopupContainerEdit+PopupContainerControl controls.
I have a Form (MDI Container) that has the "TopMost" property set to "True" .
Inside that form, i have a simple Form (MDI Child) which contains a PopupContainerEdit+PopupContainerControl .
When i want to open de Popup, it shows behind the MDI container (because it is set to TopMost=True).
So, i figured i could just set the MDI container TopMost=False when showing the  PopupContainerControl, and then, when i close it, set de MDI container back to TopMost=True.
This worked in DevExpress 16.2 . But when i upgrade to 17.2.5, the popup shows, then instantly hides. So it is unusable.
The MDI container needs to stay TopMost=True.
Would you have any solution ? 
I attached a sample project. 

1. Run attached project
2. Click "Add Band" button twice
3. In Column-Chooser window uncheck "Band 2" 
4. Unckeck "Band 1"
DataGrid doesn't contain any bands or columns now. If you close Column-Chooser you will stuck in this state.
Expected behavior: after step 3, checkbox for "Band 1" must be disabled.

So I have a list of buttons that I am trying to hide on my form.
I know to hide them I need to set the layoutcontrolItem for each Control to Visibility.Never.
I am also using a layoutcontrol which sets my buttons parent to the layoutcontrol which would then hide everything.
foreach (SimpleButton b in l)
            {
                if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(b.Text))
                    b.Visible = false;
            }
Anyway to access the layoutControlItem? 

In the demos installed by version 11.2 (usually in the folder C:\Users\Public\Documents\DevExpress 2011.2 Demos\Components\XtraReports\VB), you provide an XtraReports demo with drill-down for WPF forms in ReportWpfDemo\Modules \DrillDown.xaml.vb. However you do not provide the corresponding demo for WIN Forms. There is no ReportMainDemo\DrillDown\PreviewControl.vb. Can you please provide one?

Hey Devexpress,
I've been trying to translate the tooltips of the  RichEditUICommands but can't seem to figure out how to.
Currently we translate all other controls via  the DXLocalizers, but not only can i not find the right localizer for the job, i can't find the enums either.
Look at the attached image if in doubt of what property i want translated.
Help with being pointed in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. 

Dear Support Team,
In an Windows Forms application I am using the devexpress grid with a master detail view of own objects. All details are expanded. The user shall not be able to select the details so if the user clicks on the detail, the master row will be selected.
For a usage without a mouse, the user shall be able to scroll up and down with the cursor keys. 
That all works now but the last detail rows will not be visible when selecting the last master row.
I did not found a possibility to scroll down completely.
Attached there is a example showing my problem.
Hopefully you are able to help me to solve my problem.
Best regards,

I would like to have a single dx-form field which is a couple of checkbox controls where the user has to select at 
 one of the checkboxes. If they do not select at least one I would like a form validation error message to appear but for the group of checkboxes, not a validation message on 
 checkbox.
Basically, I would like something that behaves like a dxRadioGroup but allows one or more items to be selected. It would also be a plus if the controls could be arranged horizontally like what is possible with the radiogroup control.
How could I achieve this?

I have a model class:
This is set to the model in my page and my form looks like (from intellisense)
But the field is coming through as blank.
If I change the items to items.AddSimple().DataField("modelId")  then it loads the data but doesn't send it back up with the form submission.
Is this intended behaviour?  Am I going about this  wrong?
Incidentally the standard asp net @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.ModelID)  works.

Hi, I want to add a parameter to every new report I create with the end user Designer. I tried it with DocumentOpened event, where i add it like this:
Unfortunately my application crashes if I right click this parameter in the designer.
If it plays a role I have a custom Report Storage and implementation of IConnectionStorageService. I tried to add the parameter in the CreateNew() Method of IReportStorage but this works only for empty reports from wizard. From Database the parameter will disappear.
What would be the right way to add a parameter? Thanks!  

Hello Devexpress,
 I've been able to localize most of the font dialog via the DXLocalizer (As you can see with all the '$' in the screenshot below), but the value inside the combobox, that i marked in the screenshot, is something that i've been unable to figure out how to translate.
Any idea/help? 

Narrator does not read the selected TrackBarControl 
 
It only announces "Thumb".
 
It makes it impossible for someone visually impaired to manipulate  the "Trackbar Control"
I tried to set the Accessibility Name which works on all the other  controls.
 
Repro steps
1. Create a DevExpress WinForm
2. Create a TrackBarControl 
3.Compile and run 
4. Run Narrator
5. Set Focus to the TrackBarControl 
I can upload a sample but the above steps should make it simple enough.

I am trying to bind a data grid to a REST service. I have my service created and returning JSON, however I am unsure how to bind the data correctly. I have tried using the Odata example to try to bind my REST service to the grid, but I am unable to get it working. I keep getting the following error:

Hi,
I have a problem with deserializing the layout of my GridControl. As you could see in the project attached I have a custom grid summary item for my gridcontrol, I did that because I need the Tag property of my summary item after deserializing the layout, so I've created a custom summary item and added a SerializableTag property to it. The problem is that when I serialize the layout in one language and then deserialize it when my app's language is set to another, all the controls get their headers/names/contents and etc in the correct language except my summary item's contents. As you can see in the attached example I serialized the layout in English and then changed it to Russian and tried to deserialize it but I'm still receiving English summary items. What can I do to fix this issue?
Thanks in advance 

Dear, Devexpress Support
In TcxTableView (e.g.) when use Column.PropertiesClassName = 'TcxLabelProperties', then set TableView.DataController.FindFilterText.
In this case filtering is working but does not highlight text in this column. If  PropertiesClassName = 'TcxTextEditProperties' then filter text in column is highlited.
Is this behavior by design, or could be implemented?
We are using LabelProps for read-only columns, but need ability to filter with highlighting.

Hi, 
We are in the process of translating the MVC Dashboard component to Finnish and are nearing the point in time where we are ready to deploy the first version of the localization. 
We have extracted all resources from the relevant projects in the Localization solution, translated the resources, and inserted the translation into the corresponding *.fi.resx files. 
Trying to compile the Localization solution, provided when downloading a set of localized satellite assemblies through your localization service, I get a build error stating that the output could not be signed due to the signing key is not available

How to I get around this? 
Will it work if I disable the signing process?

Hi
im using visual studio 2017 with Asp Net Core 2.0 and MvvC, i have a grid with batch edit mode and a simple column to set a price for some items, this column is numeric, its declared as follows:
the value is saved with 2 decimals as expected but its not showing the decimals in the grid (unless you are editing the value  or adding a new value).
i have attached a couple of pictures showing this behavior, i have the grid where i set some prices for some call types and then in another i show some calls with their prices but again they are rounded and i am not getting the precise values as needed (because the summary values does take into account the decimals as they are registered as you can see in noDecimals03, the sum of all totals as shown in the grid should be 46 but in reality the values added gives 45.40 so it gets rounded to 45, i need to be able to show the correct decimal values and prevent any rounding).
so, how can i show the correct decimal values in the grids and prevent the rounding on all summaries? 
regards.

I want to mark required/mandatory fields to  my view so that user can easily make out which fields are mandatory and which are optional.
I am developing WPF app using DevExpress MVVM  Scaffolding WIzard (Hybrid UI View). I have many Views hence i don't want to do any manual step. I want a out of the box solution like all the fields which are mark as "Not Null" in database table should be marked as mandatory on view. 
Please suggest how can I achieve this without writing any C# or .xaml code.

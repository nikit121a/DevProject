Hi,
I have a slight problem using the grid.
If I add a column with 
then the column is ReadOnly immediately.
The same happens if I just say AutoPopulateColumns. The column Amount gets created but is ReadOnly.
Is there something I can do to prevent this?
I have a property called "Amount " in my data, and I'd like to bind to that.

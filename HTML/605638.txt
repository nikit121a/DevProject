I struggle to find a clean 
way to change the display text of a LookUpEdit two show a concatenation of two columns/properties. This is complicated by the fact that the data in the model is stored in a database via Entity Framework and the view is a single object view generated by the 
.
The entities of type Connector have another property "PartNo" and 
.
We abandoned using a 
or handling the 
 via 
, because both only get the ID and would need to query the DbContext to get the values of both properties. This seems wrong, since all required information are already there in the columns that are shown in the popup panel of the LookUpEdit.
Our current solution is to define a 
 in 
 and specifying it by adding 
 to all LookUpEdits we want it:
This does what we want, but we had to play around a bit to find the exact properties of the controls so it looks the same as other LookUpEdits without this ControlTemplate.
Is there a better way to do this while maintaining the MVVM pattern?

Hi,
I put a cxGrid and an panel on a TFrame Object. The TFrame has an Init procedure and a Tcolor property
From the main programm I create three of this Frame-Objects next to each other and set for
each Frame a new color property.



The result is, that each Grid on the frames has the same background color. The color is the
color I set for the last grid but the panels have different colors. That is what I want also for the
grid.
What is the problem.
Thank, you

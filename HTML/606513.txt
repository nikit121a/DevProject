Hi 
In the attached project which is really no more than a simple preparatory test prior to my building a wizard there is a comboboxedit which is populated from a linq query.  On selection of an item from that combo box another linq query is run which produces a result of type IOrderedEnumerable,XElement>.
How do I get that into the grid as its Items source.  A simple assignment seems not to do the trick.
Many thanks
Dom

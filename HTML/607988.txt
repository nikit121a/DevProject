Hello support,
I have following problem with custom filtering. In the sample I have three objects - MyObject, MySecondObject and TreeNode. The TreeNode shows tree structure in MasterDetailView (list and detail view) and each node has property "DataObject" which is of type MyObject. MyObject has property, which references MySecondObject. MySecondObject has bool property called "IsTrue", according to which I'd like to filter the MySecondObject's list views - I'd like to see only instances, which have property IsTrue set to true.
I have created a ViewController, which applies filter to list views and nested list views of MySecondObject and it works fine when viewing the list view of MySecondObject or opening nested list view of property from MyObject. My problem is here - when I'm viewing TreeNode MasterDetailView and looking at DataObject, I'd like to change MySecondObject it references. Here I need the filter not to apply.
I was thinking about possible solution of going from the nested list view up, by finding its parent detail view and going further up, to see If i could find detail view of TreeNode and, by this I would clear the filter manually. In the said controller, I'm able to access the parent detail view, but I'm not able to go further up. And since it is the same nested list view as the one when viewing from the detail view of MyObject, I don't know if I can differentiate between those two and apply the filter only to the correct one or remove it.
So I'd like to ask if there is any way of solving this problem.
I have attached sample project and screenshot, which demostrates this situation.
Thank you for your help.

Hello,
what is the right way to change edit value of a bounded TextEdit in a custom edit form using code?
For example i want to change the edit value using the closed event of a checked combobox in the same form:
sub cbx_closed(...) Handles cbx.closed
Â TextEdit.editvalue = "test"
end sub
The edit value is changed in this example. But clicking on the "update" button in the custom edit form has no effect for the bounded record.
Entering a value manualy in this TextEdit and clicking "update" works ...
thanks again for help
Michael

Hello,
What I have:
PopupControl acting as a login form, lifted straight from your Modal PopupControl demo. It has email and password feels, along with submit and cancel buttons.
What I want:
When the user clicks submit button, I have a callback go to the controller .
Controller takes email and password from textboxes in the LoginPopup and uses them to query my database for a matching user account.
If a user account is retrieved, I close the modal PopupControl - if no user account exists for the email/password combo, I do not close the popupcontrol.
How can I do this?
I currently have everything set up, except I cannot figure out how to close the popup from the controller. Do you have advice as to how to do this? 
Controller:
 public ActionResult LoginPopup(string email, string password)
        {
            ViewData["UserLoggedIn"] = false;
            var user = DataAccess.GetUserByEmailAndPassword(email, password);
            if (user != null)
            {
                ViewData["UserLoggedIn"] = true;
            }   
            return PartialView();
        }
View:
settings.ShowOnPageLoad = true;
        object userLoggedIn;
        if (ViewData.TryGetValue("UserLoggedIn", out userLoggedIn))
        {
            if ((bool)userLoggedIn)
            {
                settings.ShowOnPageLoad = false;
            }
        }
Thoughts:
I thought setting ShowOnPageLoad to false would have made this PopupControl disappear, but it doesnt.
I also thought that maybe I could do something with an EndCallback, but I can't figure out how to pass the boolean from the controller to the EndCallback. 
I've looked through a lot of help tickets, but none of them seem to be for MVC, and I do not know how to adapt what they suggest, besides the two courses of action I just outlined.
Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

I have some elements inside of the dxList itemTemplate that I don't want to trigger a selection such as a context menu activator for mobile.
My current implementation involves getting the current selected items and then resetting the selected items based off the item that was added/removed.
This would be solved if there were some form of e.cancel for onSelectionChanged.
Is there a more elegant solution available that I'm missing now?
Thanks.

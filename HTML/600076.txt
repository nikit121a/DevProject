Hi,
I need a solution how to set the color for a CommonSeriesSettings in the data source and just do use it in the preview.
I have in data sourceÂ newList.Add(new GridResArg { arg = nr, val1 = varX, val2 = varY, color = "red" });
and I want to use that parameter in chart settings.
Thank you in advance.
Best,
Zeljko

Hi support...
Is it possible to "add" to reflection dictionary a real POCO objects without decorating these with [Persistent] attribute? I've tried to do something  like this:
ReflectionDictionary dict = new ReflectionDictionary();
var classInfo = dict.GetClassInfo(pocoObject);
it works fine if pocoObject class is decorated with [Persistent] attribute... however it fails when it miss one.

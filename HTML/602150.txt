Hi,
I read below thread and works for me too but I have a quick question,  is there an easy way to keep some datafields(columns) of the same value as previously added row, our client doesn't want to re-enter again, but to change only what is needed.
This is the thread I used;
 
Let me know if someone can suggest.
Thanks,
Simon

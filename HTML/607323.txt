I didn't find answer for simple solution if it is possible to accomplish.
Simple model:
  public class TestModel
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Customer { get; set; }
        public string Country { get; set; }
        public List<Program> Program { get; set; }
    }
Need to bind Program in GridView (not in edit mode) from model, not executing look up table for each row.
Test project has implementation for binding from look  up value but there is problem with filtering - if it is combobox or list box - filter doesn't recognize values in column, if it is custom displaying - it could be filtered by group of values (ex. Description 1 1, Description 1 2, Description 1 3).
Is there anyway link column strait to the model and filter by it?
Thank you.

Hi, I want to add a parameter to every new report I create with the end user Designer. I tried it with DocumentOpened event, where i add it like this:
Unfortunately my application crashes if I right click this parameter in the designer.
If it plays a role I have a custom Report Storage and implementation of IConnectionStorageService. I tried to add the parameter in the CreateNew() Method of IReportStorage but this works only for empty reports from wizard. From Database the parameter will disappear.
What would be the right way to add a parameter? Thanks!

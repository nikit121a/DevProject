Hello,
I came across to some strange behavior with the MVVM framework under specific circumstances that I can't really describe :-) 
Please see attached sample and notice that the PropertyChangedEvent for the SelecedPerson property is fired twice and that  it's value does not correspond to selected person in the grid.
If you remove either the trigger or the binding, it seems to work.
Regards,
Theodore

Hi,
I have a dialog with a PivotGridControl and a ChartControl, where the ChartControl's DataSource is bound to the PivotGridControl's ChartDataSource. 
However, the ChartControl does not show any content when I change the selections in the PivotGridControl. 
What am I missing?
Rgds,
Petter Ballandby

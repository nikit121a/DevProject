Hello,
I have a nonpersistentÂ  type MyNonPersistentObject. In the WinApplication constructor I add it to the AdditionalSecuredTypes:
DevExpress.ExpressApp.Security.SecurityStrategyComplex.AdditionalSecuredTypes.Add(GetType(Solution18.Module.MyNonPersistentObject))
When checking SecuritySystem.IsGranted(...) I get different results, depending on which function is called:
returns 
: SecuritySystem.IsGranted(... .Read)) 
returns 
: SecuritySystem.IsGranted(... .Read, bo)) 
This was different in 17.1: both returned 
.
To reproduce this in the attached project, log in as "
" and click on the "
2" action. The MyNonPersistentObject_DetailView should show the "protected content" editor, too.

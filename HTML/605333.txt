Hi guys,
We are facing another odd problem now with logging in app.
We set TraceLogLocation to CurrentUserApplicationFolder value. In sample project log is stored into odd folder  AppData\Local\-\<App_Name> instead of into AppData\Local\<App_Name> folder. More over application must be run as an administrator to be able to create this log folder.
In our Main app otherwise we have diffferent problem - no matter if we run app with admin permissions or not we are unable to find log at all with TraceLogLocation=CurrentUserApplicationDataFolder. I can not find any mention about breaking change of this behavior in your documentation thus I am not sure if you forget to mention it or if there is some problem related to new updates to windows 10 or just some bug created by mistake.
Use case:
- Run Visual Studio as Admin (when I don't run app with admin permissions I can not find log at all)
- run the application
- look into AppData\Local\ there should be new folder with name "-" and inside it there is <App_Name> folder (in our case CurrentUserApplicationDataFolderProblem folder)
P.S.: Just little fix into your 
 there you tell in text we should set CurrentUserApplicationDataFolder into TraceLogLocation but in code example you add ApplicationFolder value into TraceLogLocation it is quite confusing.
Thanks a lot for advice.

I have configured a data grid to use Popup editing mode, and assigned a editCellTemplate to the only column on the grid that is editable.
The popup does not popup, but instead, it is displayed at the bottom of the page where the popup widget is declared, and I get this error :
Adapter for DevExpressValidator component cannot be configured .
Neither my data , nor my popup content uses any validator or validation  of any kind.
Please see the attached screen shots of the page and the error.Â  Also attached is my view.

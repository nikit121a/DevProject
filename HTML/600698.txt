Hi ,
I am using data-grid and in one column I just want user to input numbers. I tried using dataType ="number" but it  allows user to enter decimal point and comma as well. I want to disable user from entering comma in this number field. I tried using numeric type validation rules but it's not applying here. Using 
approach how can I achieve this?
In HTML:
<dxi-column id="gridSpotLength" width="7%"
 caption="Length of Spot (Seconds)"
 dataField="lengthOfSpot" dataType="number">
 <dxi-validation-rule type="pattern"
 [pattern]="numberPattern"
 message="Comma and Alphabets are not allowed"></dxi-validation-rule>
 In .ts (TypeScript) file: 
numberPattern: any = /^\d+([.]\d+)?$/;

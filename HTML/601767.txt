Hi Guys,
 I'm not sure what I am doing wrong, although I am unable to restore the filter string when calling RestoreLayoutFromStream.
I have a grid, with one band and one column.
If I save the layout,  I can see the filter string in the XML.
When I restore the layout, it sets some properties, but not the filter string!  
I have read online that we need to set the band name, that hasn't helped.
Steps:
* Load the sample
* Set a filter via the small icon on the column header
* Change the column width
* Save the layout
* Remove the filter and change the width back
* Restore from layout
- Column width is restored, auto filter row is populated with the filter, but the filter is not applied.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
David

I believe I found a bug in the layout algorithm of the LayoutControl. If the layout item whose label is the longest character-wise is not the longest width-wise, layout of the input control fails. It doesn't happen always and I'm afraid I can't invest more time in finding the specific circumstances.
It happens when 
is set and

So on the off chance that I made a mistake, here is XAML code that produces this error.

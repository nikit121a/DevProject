Hi
I removed the  <property name="Caption"> from the XML layout.
When restoring, the Caption is reset to FieldName
I did the same for ToolTip. After restoring the layout, the ToolTip still has the value it had before the restore.
Why is the Caption not working the same way ?
I was expecting that if a property is not in the XML layout that the property would keep its current value.
I have a few properties that I set automatically when the grid loads.
For instance, the Tooltip comes from a table.
If I change aToolTip in the table I want this updated Tooltip to always show in the views. I dont want the old tooltips in the layout to be used. 
That is why I remove the ToolTip property from the layout automatically before saving it.
It works for ToolTip but not for Caption.
Is there a workaround ?
Am I correct in assuming that if a property in not in the layout that this property will keep its current value after the layout is restored ?

Good morning,
I have a gridcontrol with the list of dynamically loaded columns. At runtime I change the list of columns (add a new column). The new column does not show the value on the screen, but in the bind list the value is there. 
How can I improve the content?  
Attached an example  
Thanks for the reply  
Luca

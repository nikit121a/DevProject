In may application (using HybridApp as Template) I have one TdxTilecontrol with three tiles used as buttons.
The buttons opens a second frame for some user entry.
The function is ok, but the dxTilecontrols shows unwanted scrollbuttons, see screenshot, they are not only unwanted, but have no useful function.
dxTileControls OptionsBehaviour.Scrollmode has no influence here.
The tileControl is contained in a dxLayoutItem, which is part of a dxLayoutgroup.
The LayoutgroupRoot has both scrolloptions set to smNone.
Currently the only known way to get rid of these buttons is to put a lot  of spaces after the dxTileControl.Title.Text ("create / delete").
This  is the only difference between the two lower screenshots.
Is there another way to suppress display of the scrollbuttons ?

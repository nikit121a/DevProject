Hi,
I'm need to setup the RichEditControls SimpleView.Padding  property in my project.
According to the documentation it is a System.Windows.Forms.Padding structure and the values are in pixels.
But the documentation does not precisely mention if these pixels are device independent or not.
In Wpf Padding properties usually are  System.Windows.Controls.Thickness structures with values in device  independent pixels (DIP in wpf 1/96 inch). 
Does the SimpleView.Padding property expect device dependent pixel units, so that I have to take into account a conversion if I have the source values in usualÂ  WPF units (device independent pixels = 1/96inch)?
or
Does the SimpleView.Padding property already expected device independent pixels and I could omit a conversion on my own?
Thanks for clarification!
Best regards,
Stefan
Btw: The jumps from Wpf into WinForms are a little bit confusing but I can understand the reasons (according to 
)

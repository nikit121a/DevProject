Hi Team,
I am trying to create a custom control with 7 ToggleSwitch controls with in a StackPanel. 
Content of the control will be a binary number Â ex: 0000001.
0 - Checked 
1 - UnChecked 
Now I am not able to figure out how can we assign these values to each ToggleSwitch when we change the content. ex: 0000011. 
Thanks,
Siva

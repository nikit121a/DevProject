2. How to rename view switcher in MVC Extension? (I already remained this question, but I did not get right answer.)
EX)
@(Html.DevExtreme().Scheduler()
...
 .Views(v => {
        v.Add()
            .Name("Week")
            .Type(DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.SchedulerViewType.TimelineWorkWeek);
        v.Add()
            .Name("Month")
            .Type(DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.SchedulerViewType.Month);
    })
...
)
Above code is not working..

4. How can I set All-Day appointment automatically?

Hello,
 we are facing a problem while exporting reports to csv.
In the result all headers and fields  should be wrapped in quotation marks.
I found some tickets regarding this topic. Most of them are for the grid control (eg 
).
In
one solution is presented.
There CsvExportOptionsEx is used with the CustomizeCell event.
But when exporting a report to csv, this event isn't called.
Why is that? Do you have an other way to add quotation marks?
Thanks
Matthias

Hi,
I'm using continuous scrolling on most of my grids.  How can I set it up that the initial render loads enough data to fill the screen and then reduce the data page size to say 10 rows at a time.
Currently I have it set to 40 rows, this is to guarantee that the initial page is completely filled with data.  but I would prefer the page size to be smaller than this for later loads.

I have a View with multiple TextEdits that are bound to properties of an entity object in my ViewModel.
When saving changes, I'm making an async service call that in case of validation errors returns a ModelState object with a collection of validation errors for each property that failed valication.
What is the correct way to show these validation errors in the View on each TextEdit that failed validation?

The method that is described in documentation as cellValue(rowIndex, visibleColumnIndex, value) is implemented as cellValue(rowIndex, columnIdentifier, value) where the column is retrieved in cellValue() with this._columnsController.columnOption(columnIdentifier).
ColumnOption accepts the index of the column, but not the visibleIndex.
Therefore the index should be used  as argument for cellValue instead of visibleIndex.

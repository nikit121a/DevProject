Hello,
please can you help me with a query. I am struggling to understand why this is happening or what I am doing wrong.
I have included a sample project for your attention which demonstrates the error. 
The scenario is, while I am creating an order I would like to add a dependant to a member. Now I realise I could just create a new dependant using the lookupeditor of the dependant property on the order, but in my real world project this is not possible so please bear with me.
I have created a viewcontroller with a popup action that opens the member detailview where I can create a new dependant, but it seems that during the save of the member object it is also creating a null member object which is why the firstname validation is failing. if you debug the code you will see this object being created.
The steps to show this error are
1. run the application and create a member without dependants.
2. run the order screen create a new order and select the existing member, and click on the view controller "add dependant"
3. the member screen opens correctly. 
4. enter a dependant on the member and save the member
5. you will see if fails with the first name being empty
6. this error is not from the current member object but this phantom null member object which is being created at the same time.
Please let me know if this is a bug or if there is another way to do this, or what needs changing,
thank you

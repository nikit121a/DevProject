When  performing a bookkeeping program, any unnecessary mouse click is  redundant and must be reduced to a lesser extent due to the speed of  typing the operator. Is there a possibility that  immediately after clicking on the UPDATE button on the parent table, you  immediately open a new children's form ready to insert data with focus  on the first item in the form. And after clicking on the  UPDATE button in the child's form, it saves the data and immediately  opens a new child form with focus on the first item? In this way, the operators on the program greatly accelerate the data entry without excessive mouse clicks. And  so every time until a click on the CANCEL button, then the child form  does not open automatically after the form has been quashed.Â

Hi
I believe that there is an error in 
in that the timer should be the first object destroyed.  
The current code is:
destructor TdxSpellCheckerCheckAsYouTypeMode.Destroy;
begin
  FreeAndNil(FCheckThread);
  FreeAndNil(FCorrectWords);
  
  FreeAndNil(FMisspelledWords);
  FreeAndNil(FViewInfo);
  DeallocateHWnd(FSyncHelper);
  DeleteCriticalSection(FCurrentWordInfoLock);
  DeleteCriticalSection(FLock);
  inherited Destroy;
end;
In a very specific scenario it is possible that the timer can fire after 
but before it is freed itself.  This leads to an AV in procedure TdxSpellCheckerCheckAsYouTypeMode.StartSpellingThread as FCheckThread is now nil.
I've managed to reproduce in a test app, but I think the timing may be critical so it may be difficult to reproduce if your PC is faster/slower than mine.  Anyway, to test, please create a new project, delete Unit1 and replace with the units attached, set TForm1 as the mainform and then run.
If you wait a second or two and then press the button, you should see an AV.
If I change the order in the destructor, to free FDelayTimer first, then the AV goes away.
Kind regards

Thank you very much that worked like a charm.
Based on the same lines, is there a better way to save the grip layout with a name on click of a button and then display the list of Saved grid layouts with name and load it.
How can this be done with the above approach on click of the bookmark button. Any help is appreciated.
Thanks

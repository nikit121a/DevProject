Hi,
I have a Devextreme Datagrid using popup editor in my project.  I used columns and then forms item group  to arrange the layout.  I have arranged my controls as follows;
item#1 - Textbox but disabled
 item#2 - Lookup control
 item#3 - Lookup control
 item#4 - Lookup control
 item#5 - Textbox but enabled
etc, etc.... 
When i clicked edit or add(+)  button , I need to press tab in keyboard so the first enabled item (item#2 lookup) will have the focus.
 Can someone help me so that when the edit page loaded it will automatically focus on the first enabled control which is the lookup control.
I tried also this code in OnEditorPrepared  >>>>   e.component.focus(e.component.getCellElement(rowindex, <columntofiocus>))
but no luck.
I attached  my .cshtml file so you can check.
Thanks,
Simon

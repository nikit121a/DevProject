Hi,
I want to move from codeRush classic to CodeRush Roslyin. I see that the documentation says it currently  does not support HTML, ASP.NET, CSS, Razor, JavaScript        . I would like to know when to expect this functionality and in which versions u intend to start supporting.
Thanks & Regards,
Naser Javed Malik

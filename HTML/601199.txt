I had also mentioned about issue with date column in my first query(the selected date is not highlighted in filter popup instead today’s date is highlighted.). Is there a way where we can highlight all the populated dates(populated under Date Column) in the pop up?
 I have modified the solution to demonstrate the issue. The zip file also contains DateHighlightIssue.png file showing the issue. let me know if you need more info.
Regards,
Rahul

I would like to know if it is possible and if so how to setup a page that would have say a grid or table 4 x 3Â  in size that contains an image from a particular folder that when clicked would show either an image gallery or image slider of all images that are in the folder from which the image was clicked. In essence, the initial view would contain 12 images from 12 different folders with say the first image from each folder shown.

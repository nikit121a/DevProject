Hi there,
I am using custom repository item in gridview by referring 
. 
But somehow i stuck by following issues :
1.How to Auto-Height the row as per custom repository item's content and
2.How to trigger event from custom repository item to its parent grid.
Do you have more simplified way to add custom repository item in v17.2?
Thanks

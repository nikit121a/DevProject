Hi,
I'm trying to fix a reported bug that has to do with the paste option from a context menu.  To duplicate, I created a simple test application.  This application uses a client dataset and creates 10 data rows in memory.  To duplicate the problem:
- make sure you have some text in your clipboard
- run the application
- put focus in either the edit field or the memo.  Leave focus there.
- right click from the field with focus and you'll see the standard context menu and the paste option will be enabled
- click the navigator to go to the last record in the dataset.  
- now when you right click on the field with focus, the paste option is disabled.  Scrolling through the dataset (via the navigator) doesn't fix it.
If you change focus to another field, the paste option is available again.   It's also interesting to note, that even when the paste option is disabled, ctrl-V still works (proving there is still text in the clipboard).
Can you help?  Seems trivial, but we have a customer who relies on this type of thing.
Thanks,
Dan

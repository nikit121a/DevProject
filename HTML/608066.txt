Hello,
I would like to toggle the check state of a custom gridviewtoolbaritem of a aspxGrid in client side.
What i've done so far is to add a toolbar item. Set the ToolbarItemClickÂ  client side method to execute a js function something like this:
However I am not able to set the button as checked as it was done in the builtin ClearFilter toolbar item.
Thanks in advance.

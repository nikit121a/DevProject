Hi 
I have a customer requirement to specify the encoding of a text export. However, when the encoding option is specified, even with an explicit TEncoding.UTF8, the result is an ANSI file.
Since the environment is using FireDAC and the Oracle instant client , I investigated the database encoding. For this product it is UTF8. As the FireDAC parameter Characterset was blank, I specifically set this to UTF8 at designtime. This did not result in any improvement.
At one point, NotePad++ Encoding DID say UTF8, but Notepad indicates it is ANSI, as does another encoding checker I downloaded.The customer verified it was not UTF8.
Even if the data being exported was ANSI, I'd expect an explicit conversion to UTF8 from the ExportGridToText procedure.
Am I missing something here?
as an aside, the file format required is actually CSV and we abandoned the CSV-specific export some time back as we could not get ANSI from it. I tried reinstating ExportGridtoCSV, but it  a) is still ANSI and B) contains two quote characters rather than one (eg ""12"").

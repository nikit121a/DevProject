Hello!
I need to prevent the user from selecting certain values (these items have tag=1) online.
I could not find an event like CheckStateChanged.
P.s. These items must behave like  radioButton. If the user checks the second item, when the first is checked, the first checkState must be unchecked.Â I will remind, it concerns only those items at which the tag is equal '1'.
Thank you!

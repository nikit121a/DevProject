Hi,
 We have had a few of our end-users get an error "Access violation at address 0C660A95 in module 'dxPSCoreRS22.bpl'. Read of address 00000000" (address varies) when opening a form that contains a TdxComponentPrinter, with a CurrentLink of a TdxCustomContainerReportLink (its Component property is set to print the entire form, and it's a fairly complex form with dock panels etc).
The issue is exceedingly rare - we've had only 4 reports of it so far out of hundreds of customers. We certainly have not been able to reproduce it ourselves.
It seems to happen after upgrading the software from a version that used DevExpress  VCL 16.1.2 to 17.1.5 (it's also possible the affected machines may have run earlier versions of DevExpress VCL in the past). So far it has only affected one user per customer - other users at the same customer running the same copy of the software from a shared network drive have no problem, but one user on one machine has the problem.
I suspect it's something to do with the user's Windows profile. One customer was able to resolve the problem by restoring the user's Windows profile from an earlier backup. Another resolved the issue by replacing the user's hard drive (they were doing this anyway to upgrade the user's machine to Windows 10).
I know it's not much to go on, but can you provide any information that might shed some light on this issue? Does ExpressPrinting store or use anything in the user's Windows  profile, or something else that is specific to the user/machine, that might cause this error? Could it have anything to do with the printers that the user has access to in Windows?

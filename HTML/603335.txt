Hi I have files in the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform and I am trying to load one into the aspxspreadsheet control for example
here is the format of the azure url storage (bloburi)
 Manager%5CiFishManager%5CifishManager%5CApp_Data%5Cfish_feed.xls
 and when I execute this code
the url does work and you can paste it into a browser and it downloads.

Hi,
I am having hard time implementing cellstyle to gridControlBand gridColumn. I can apply cellstyle property to other gridColumns but not to the gridColumns which are under gridControlBand.
My cellStyle looks something like this:  Style BasedOn={staticresource gridRowThemeKey ResourceKey=CellStyle, TargetType=CellContentPresenter>
<Setter Property=Back..> ..
This doesnt get applied to few gridColmns as I mentioned.
Please help

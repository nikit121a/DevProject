When I execute 
 'this.inventoryItemsTableAdapter1.Fill(APPATSDataSet.InventoryItems, false, null, null);' 
I get an Exception thrown with the message
  "Failed to enable constraints. One or more rows contain values violating non-null, unique, or foreign-key constraints."
I don't have any constraints on the table at the DB level.
How can I track down where this error is coming from?

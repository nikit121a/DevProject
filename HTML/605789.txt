I was wondering if there is a way of hooking up on a onClick event of the dxCalendar. At first I thought I could subscribe to onValueChanged but I quickly realized that this event doesn't suit me as I might be clicking on an already selected date so this event would not fire.
My idea is to present the calendar control for each month for the current year and than the user can click on various dates and will get a popup where he can enter the holiday name and description.
Right now I can deal with that by subscribing to onValueChanged but this only works if I want to select a date that has not yet been selected.If I click on an already selected date, nothing happenes(obviously since no change has been made to the value) .

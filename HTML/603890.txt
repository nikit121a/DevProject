Hi team,
The aspxSpreadsheet control is quite useful to us. Meanwhile we have some thoughts to beautify it or to make it a nicer look. Therefore we have a few questions here. If you can help or provide some suggestions, that will be appreciated!
For all these questions, you can always the your online demo for reference
2. The control has the feature of Excel that scrolling down or scrolling right reach es no boundary. Can we turn off that feature? for example set the right-most column to be column M or set the bottom-most row to be row 100?Â 
Thank you!
Best,
Jiong

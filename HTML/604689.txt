Hi, a question about MVVM WinForm framework.
I've a viewmodel with 8 properties, all this properties are bound to a gridcontrol on view.
Reading this 
 we have add 
on our grid.
The check box in not bound to a property model, see enclosed screen shot.
How could we add new button to this form in order to iterate on all the entity bound to gridcontrol and check if 
 is selected on gridcontrol.
Remember check box it's not bound to model.
Thank you in advance.
Fabio

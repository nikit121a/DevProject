Hello,
I'm struggling on centering the wait form on the parent form.
I have  a parent form(Form1) for example.
When I launch the wait form it doesn't display on the center of the parent form. 
splashScreenManager1.ShowForm(Me, GetType(WaitForm1), False, False, SplashFormStartPosition.Manual, Me.PointToScreen(Me.Location))
What Am I doing wrong?
Thanks
Edil

Hi support team,
I am using PersistentAlias in my domain object and I am viewing it with several persitent objects in a grid bound to the table through a xpServerCollectionSource - so we are using the grid in server mode.

Is this one of the feature limitations of server mode? For unbound columns I can understand this feature limitation, but for persistent alias-fields, I thought this would be a way to calculate values on server side, so a summary on server side should be possible as well.
Here is my persistent alias defintion:

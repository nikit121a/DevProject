Hello,
I'm using the DXTabControl .
I've created a custom style for the DXTabItems.
Now I want to use the Theme Office 2016 Colorful SE.
But in this theme the re is a black horizontal line on to of the Tab-Header.
Is there a possibility to hide this black line?
I've attached a screenshot to demonstrate it.
Thanks andÂ with best regards ,
Fabian

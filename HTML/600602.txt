Hi there,
I was in version 17.1.7 and migrated to 17.2.5.
I have two custom themes.
1. Based on MetropolisDark
2. Based on LightGray.
I have successfully migrated both themes to version 17.2.5  and able to compile it in WPF Theme editor.
Unfortunately when I preview the it in WPF Theme editor in case of LightGray theme, it didn't work. and WPF Theme Editor crashed.
Please find the converted to theme as an attachment.

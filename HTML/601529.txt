Hi,
I'd like to add a conditional appearance to an object of my xaf web application, but what I need is to set the color dynamically. I mean, for instance to set the BackColor property from a function to calculate the color depending on a condition.
I have a column that show an state configured in my database, and each state has a defined  color, so I want to show the state with the backcolor defined for each state.
I don't know how to apply this action.
Thanks.

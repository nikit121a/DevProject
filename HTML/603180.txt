I am trying to construct a WinForms application that has a ribbon and application menu that are always present with default buttons and menu items, but I add content to the ribbon based on the type of file that is opened.  I would like to support DevExpress RichEditControl and SpreadsheetControl ribbons, as well as my own custom ribbons.
As an example, I may have a Home category that is always present in the ribbon, but when a .DOCX file is opened, I dynamically add a RichEditControl with the full auto-generated ribbon from DevExpress (and perhaps minor customizations to the ribbon).  If I close the .DOCX file and open an .XLSX file, then I remove the RichEditControl and the associated ribbon content and then dynamically add a SpreadsheetControl with all of the auto-generated ribbon content to the main ribbon.  I may also open an image that has a different ribbon.  I do not wish to support multiple files being opened at the same time, or document panel floating, or MDI tabs. 
What is the best strategy to achieve this?  Thanks much.

Hey,
I have the problem, that if I group on a column which has only one value and ungroup it, the first line getsÂ corrupted.
This is only working with a certain setting of gridview.
I provided you a demo.Steps to repro:
Group on TypeTry.
Ungroup TypeTry.
You will see the problem in the first column
Best regards
Benjamin Schr?der

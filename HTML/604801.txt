In my grid I have columns that are bound to SQL Server DateTime columns but I am only concerned with the time part and use the RepositoryItemTimeEdit as their column editor. However, the excel style drop down shows options for dates and nothing for times.
Is there any way to configure this to display something suitable for times?  Ideally be able to specify a time range (i.e. 09:00 to 12:00).

Hi
I'm currently trying to write some unit tests (using standard VSTest, no 3rd party library like nUnit) and as long as I'm starting only the tests everything runs fine - the problem comes when I'm starting the test runner with coverage. Then the Test Runner freezes (I only have very few tests at the moment that usually finish in a few seconds), the only output I get is "Test started..." and a "loading" bar in the VS footer that stays there for long (I've waited for some minutes but it didn't disappear). Also the code coverage stays at 0 lines, probably because the runner never finishes. This isn't probably enough information to find the bug/wrong configuration, so please tell if you need more data. I'm using VS2017 professional, the solution itself contains some vb.net projects, LOC totally about 7000 (I guess this influences the execution time). The installed Devexpress Components version is 17.1.6 (not the same as CodeRush) as I need this one because of developing/fixing some already released software.
Greetings
Martin

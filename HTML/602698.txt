Been working with the camercontrol and have a working exe app. but now I am trying to create a dll but I am getting an error when trying to create the form with the cameracontrol on it.
procedure GetPhoto(AFile : pAnsiChar); stdcall;
var
  _aFile  : string;
begin
  _aFile := String(AFile);
  frmCamera := TfrmCamera.Create(nil);
  frmCamera.camPicture.Active := True;
  frmCamera.camPicture.Capture;
  frmCamera.camPicture.CapturedBitmap.SaveToFile(_aFile);
  FreeAndNil(frmCamera);
end;
when it runs the create line I get a MAV(memory access violation) error. 
What am I missing in order to get cameracontrol to work in a dll.

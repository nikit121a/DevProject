Hi guys,
We are facing aÂ  problem in XAF Web.
When user uses IE 9 or 10 there is strange behavior when user try to change filter above GridView. I attached a simple sample.
Use case:
- turn on compatibility view settings for domain you testing on - IE 11 -> Settings -> Compatibility View Settings -> Add localhost:port
- run app
- DomainObject1_ListVIew should be initial view
- Press F10 Developer tools in IE and change compatibility to IE 10 or 9
- Open some other app (chrome, word, Visual studio whatever application) in front of IE
- do not minimalize this whatsoever application just in taskbar choose IE again (whatsoever app should stay open not minimized behind IE window)
- then try to change filter above DomainObject1_ListView - after click on some filter IE is throwed to background and whatsoever app is pushed to front
 This behavior is pretty annoying and most of our cusomers uses IE 10 which cause problems a lot. From what I read on the internet some css could cause this behavior in IE9/10 (can not remember which one).
Could you please somehow fix this? IE 11 and other browsers are ok this roblem occurs only in IE9/10.
Thanks a lot

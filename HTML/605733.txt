Hi,
I want to use the TimeSpanEditor in my application, however I don?t know how to configure a mask that allow the user to pick only days.
TimeSpanEdit by default offers Dd:Hh:Mm:SsÂ  as the standard mask... I want to change the mask so it shows only whole days...
How can I do that?
By the way, Vb.Net here..

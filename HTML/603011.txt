Hello,
This ticket is related to the previous one:
Unfortunately not only horizontal scrolling works slow in IE.
We receive complaints from our customers that some features of datagrid works slower in IE than in Chrome.
Here is codepen example: 
Following things works slowly:
Column resizing: especially for columns located on the left side ('Employee', 'Order Date')
Column box grag/drop while trying to group data
Column reordering: column box drag/grop as well as column order change itself
I am using IE 11.850.15063.0.
Is there any way to increase performance?

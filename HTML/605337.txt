If the Annotations are defined with dates that are close enough there will be annotations "Colliding" with each other; that is, Annotations will overlap and when they overlap they become difficult to read. What guidance if any can you provide in predetermining when items overlap?
Your help here would be much appreciated.
That said, I believe this ticket can be closed as resolved.
Thanks for your assistance.

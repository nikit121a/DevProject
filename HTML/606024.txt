I have a grid whose columns are dynamically added on load. I am trying the batch edit functionality and wants to save only modified column values in a row.Â 
The row updating event provides me old and new values for all columns
protected void GvRatePlanner_RowUpdating(object sender, DevExpress.Web.Data.ASPxDataUpdatingEventArgs e)
{
} 
How could we find only modified columns values in this event. My number of columns could grow to be hundred with multiple rows, so i don't want to match each column value one by one (this will have a performance hit)  and update only modified values in database.

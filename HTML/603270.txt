I have a page with a ComboBox and a batch edit GridView. The row content in the grid is determined by the choice made in the combo box.
If the grid has unsaved changes, and the value of the combo box is  changed, I would like to prompt the user informing them that unsaved changes will be lost and give them an opportunity to either confirm or cancel their combo box change.
I see some events  on the ASPxClientComboBox class (
), however I'm not sure if any of these are suited for what I'm a trying to do? 
Ideally, I would be able to handle an event on the client side, check some conditions, and if I need to cancel the combo box change set 
or something similar. Is such functionality possible?

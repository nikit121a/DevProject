Hello support,I've attached a sample project to reproduce this error I'm getting:
-go to Person
-go to the detailview in edit mode
-start inline-editing a Car
-click on the NextObject action on the top right of the screen to go to the next Person without saving the row you started editing
-Try creating a new car on the second Person
It will giveÂ ObjectDisposedException. Why?
Thank you,
Giuseppe

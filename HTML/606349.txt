We need to keep track and log to database when a user has printed or exported a report in our XAF apps.
This is the closest reference I could find: 
I combined this article's use of the __EVENTTARGET and __EVENTARGUMENT  with a controller that gets the ASPxWebDocumentViewer in this fashion (I'm assuming WebDocViewer will work for this trick as well):
 
I'm blocked, though, because Default.aspx's Page_Load never returns anything for eventtarget or eventargument. If I could get a hold of this information another way I could get the controller linked up with that info however I needed to.  Does that information get posted back anywhere else in the XAF app? 
Is this even the correct approach?
I've tried to bind to the Executed events on the actions of the  WebExportController and WebReportsController, but none of those ever seem to fire. I just need one reliable way to capture when a report is printed or exported, and then a way to disable all the others :)
I also tried this approach to see if I could customize the popup control somehow. Putting this code in either OnActivated or ControlsCreated doesn't capture the event:
 
Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

We have a WPF application that is built against v16.1.6 of the DevExpress Components..
In our application user selections often show a property grid with the values for the selected item.
The following behaviour has been observed;
- Windows desktop scaling is set to 125% 
- User selects an item that has more properties than the property grid can display, so the vertical scroll bars appear
- user hovers  over the property grid and uses the mouse wheel to scroll the grid
- The UI completely freezes - no visual updates, and not responding to user input - and looking in the task manager the program is using almost 100% of a single CPU core.
Recreating the issue in a debugging session i was able to observe that pausing the 'frozen'  application, shows that the main thread seems to be endlessly looping through a render or layout cycle.
Also, although this issue was originally observed running on a number of Windows 10 systems, I was also able to create the issue in Windows 7 (64-bit)
The effect can be demonstrated in the WPF demos app that came with the components install.
- Open the WPF PropertyGrid demo
- Select the "Category Attributes" example
- make the window less tall so that the grid needs to be scrolled to see all of the content
- hover over the grid and scroll up and down with the mouse wheel.
All assistance in resolving this would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Sean Brennan

Attached is a sample project demonstrating the current progress. Refer to the SearchMyPersonController.actionNext_Execute method. I am trying to get the selected item from the listview and then set it as current object so that the second tab is populated with Person Data.
The approach suggested in theÂ 
 ticket does not seem to work. The second tab is always blank. For selected person it adds a dropdown whereas I need the entire object to be displayed in second tab in editable format. That's the reason I had inherited from Person object in the first place. Also SelectedPerson is always null so it goes to IF only and never goes to ELSE.
 I don't think the functionality required can be implemented as it is too complex for a design like this.
Anyway thank you for your help.

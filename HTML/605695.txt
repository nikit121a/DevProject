I used E108, but it has no report or page headers like most reports do. How do I get the column headings to appear differently for the first page?
For example, my report should look like this when rendered:
Report Header
  First page info goes here
Detail Report
  Column headings go here
  First page of grid goes here
Page Break
Page Header
  Column headings go here
  Rest of grid goes here

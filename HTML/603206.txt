I want to "print" something in the CustomDrawNotesCell event of the TcxSchedulerReportLink object.
I want to define the position in mm. To do this I need to know the resolution of the canvas.
I saw that AItem.Width is16950, on print it's 90 mm. 
The question is where comes the 16950 from?
If I don't made any mistake this is approx. 4775 dpi (That's neither the dpi of my screen nore of my printer) .
Any hint is welcome.
Thanks in advance.
With kind regards,
Ruediger Kabbasch

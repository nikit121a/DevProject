I am trying to use MVVM docking where a parent DockLayoutManager WellDockLayoutManager can have multiple panels each with it's own ItemContentTemplate={StaticResource WellContentTemplate} page (WellView.xaml).Â  I would like the "InterpLayoutDockManager" in WellView.xaml to bind up to the parent DocumentPanel "WellViewModel.InterpDocuments".
Thanks,
Dan

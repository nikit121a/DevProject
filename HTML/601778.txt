I have aÂ <dx-popup> element in my component template and I want to add a dxLoadPanel such that it covers and shades the entire popup container not just the content (including header and toolbars).
I tried using  
but this doesn't work because the id attribute I assigned to the dx-popup element doesn't actually get applied to the instanced popup at runtime.
How can I make this work?

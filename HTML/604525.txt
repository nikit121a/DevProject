Hi, 
I am using the approach described in ticket 
 in order to display some swimlanes in a diagram.
What I need is to stretch these containers  to the whole scrollable area in diagram canvas and keep them visible regardless I zoom in, zoom out or scroll to a particular node in the diagram.
I attached a sample in order to illustrate better the context.
Please take a look.
Best regards,
Alin

Hello Experts, 
We recently upgraded DevExpress Version 17.25 for our application. 
But we noticed that ColorDataMember does not display the bindable color property. Earlier version (17.1.4) it was working well. 
We have Series ItemSource, where ArgumentDataMember, ValueDataMember and ColorDataMember are associated to predefined properties with BarSideBySideStackedSeries2D. 
Ex) 
We want to display some specific colors, but currently it shows all default colors. 
The color property type is System.Windows.Media.Color
 Please guide me how to fix the issue. 
Best Regards
Parth

Hi DevExpress,
thank you for your amazing work and quick support. Let's have I look into the issue. Our project is consist from two parts. 
First part is windows service that is used as data provider. This part communicate with others via SignalR and is connected to database via XPO. 
Second part is application for presenting data. This application implementing GridControl. DataSource of it have to be provided from first application via SignalR.
 
What kind of data should be returned from SignalR method to get all functionality of GridControl (grouping, filtering etc.).
 
So is there any recommendation how to solve this issue ?  Or could you please provide an example solving this issue ?

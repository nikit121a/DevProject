I have a grid where I am setting the NonColumnFilter based on user selections.  the initial filter was being set before the grid was bound to a datasource, then as the user makes changes to the filter selections the filter was was overwritten with the new values.  In 14.2 this worked but after upgrading to 17.x the initial filter is set correctly but any subsequent changes to the filter end up as a combination of the new filter and the initial filter.
IE.  Initial filter - Status ="1"   if the user selects to filter on Status = "2" the new filter ends up as   Status = "1" and Status = "2"
If I change my code to make sure the initial filter is applied after the grid is bound to the datasource then this does not happen.

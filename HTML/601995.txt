Hello 
I have the following problem (web only):
if i open a detail view with multiple Sub- List-Views in which one has an action connected AND the list is filtered AND the view was started on a different tab then the first one, the action does not enable even if the target criteria is true. 
Ways to enable the action:
1. change the filter
2. de-select / re-select all rows
3. refresh the view manually
I have attached a sample project. Please do the following:
1.  start the web project
2. enter a "MainObject"
3. enter a couple of "SubObjects" (only fill in the names)
4. Save
5. Switch to the tab "SubObjects2"
6. Close the MainObject and return to the  MainObject-ListView
7. Open the MainOject you just created in a detail view
8. Since the tab "SubObjects2" is now automatically opened - select the first tab
9. Check all rows with the check box above the list
10. both actions are disabled
11. change the filter
12. Check all rows with the check box above the list
13. one of the actions is enabled
This behaviour is found any time a list is not displayed to begin with and has a filter.
Any ideas?
Regards
Chris

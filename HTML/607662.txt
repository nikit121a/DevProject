Hey folks
i studied your documentation and read many tickets like 
 or 
, however i having trouble getting it to work.
I'm trying to build a ReportDesigner for Win and ASP.net  which supports all kind of 
 like the ones you supports for your Dashboard Control.
Win ReportDesigner (without OLAP) works like a charm. But i have enormous problems to get it to work for the ASPxReportDesigner.
I attached a sample, which shows what i'm trying to do.
I have to support SQL Databases, XML and Excel/CSV Files.
I have to support CustomQuerys (
) for all kind of sql data sources
It seems there is no wizard like the Excel/CSV Wizard  for handling this kind of Files (I created always a 
)
Since i can not define a query for each data source, because i do not know the schema, tables and so on of any(!) data source (data sources are created by End-user) i struggle to get any Table/View/SP item of the data source - although I set theÂ 
at Application_Start, the "Select data member" and "Select data fields" lists are empty.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Regards,
Micha

In our application MainWindow with POCO VM which contains  StatusBar
But other as UserControl opens in document TABs
How do I set/change bindable CurrentStatus from UserControl or generally from outside
For example per each save click in UC this Statusbar should react
From Outlook inspired App example i see each view has own "dxr:RibbonStatusBarControl"  but  because the application more complicated
What you recommend?

Hi,
When navigating through different records in a detailview [in edit mode] the caption shown in the header is incorrect . 
In the Model Editor we have set the ObjectCaptionFormat to a simple DisplayName asÂ  {0:DisplayName}
When clicking the 'Next Record' button, we expect to see:
Client1
Client2
Client3
Client4
Instead we get:
 Client1
 Client1
Client2
Client3
Client4 .
All edit fields in the view are shown correctly and also the 'please wait..' screen is shown while loading.

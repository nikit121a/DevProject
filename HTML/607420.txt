I recently upgraded to version 17.2.5.   Initially I had a problem where the popup menu to add devexpress item was greyed out.  I searched the support tickets and found a hot fix that solved that problem.  The issue I am having now is that the "designer"  I am not sure what it is actually called, that shows when you first create a view that lets you add controls no longer appears.  I included a screen shot from your documentation of what I am supposed to see and instead I see a blank form when I first create a view.  I am able to add controls from the toolbox but being able to quickly setup layouts in a new view using the screen shown in the attached image saves time.  I don't know if part of the problem is that I have version 16.2.5 installed as well.  This problem happens in both existing and new projects when I go to add a view.
Thanks in advance for the help.

Hi,
We use the DashboardViewDataSourceFillService in our XAF integration of the dashboard.  As this service does not support non-persistent fields is there a way to remove these fields from the list of fields to select?  As the designer uses a regular collection it is possible to pick non-persistent fields when designing a dashboard which then causes the dashboard view to fail when it uses the DashboardViewDataSourceFillService.  Related to this issue, I don't see why the designer shows collection properties and marks them as not available (with the "x" icon) - why not just not show these fields?

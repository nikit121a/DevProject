Hi,
I have a ListBoxEdit control which I am using to provide selection of values to the user.
The selection works fine, however, when the user clicks on something else, causing the ListBoxEdit to loose focus, the selection color is lost too. 
I am using Metropolis Dark theme. 
Is there a way to maintain the selection for the ListBoxEditItem even when the focus is lost?
The functionality similar to the FadeSelectionOnLostFocus for TableView of GridControl.
Please suggest.
Thanks,
Vijay

Dear Support,
I have 1 master report RP_Bilan
 and 2 subreport 2 x RP_Actif
My report is connected to a db, but I create for you in case you need a csv file is my record set
I try to modify the filterstring but is not working for me
When I evaluate the expression
Iif([comptetype] = [ReportItems].[Report].[FilterString], [solde],'') is not working
Thanks for your help.

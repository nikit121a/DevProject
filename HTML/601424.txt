I have a project that uses a Word add in. When I open up a WPF dialog and try to open my Popup Color Editor dropdown, nothing seems to happen. When I debug the issue, it seems fine. However, when I run the debug and open the deployed add in, instead of nothing happen, I seem to be hitting this error: 
 Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.
************** Exception Text **************
System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
This seems like some sort of Referencing issue, but It seems impossible to pin down because the debugging build seems to be fine.
I noticed that the references cannot be loaded in the project properties reference page.
The devexpress add ins I am using are:
Version 17.2
Data
PDF.Core
Printing.Core
Mvvm
Images
Xpf.Core
Xpf.Themes.Office2016White

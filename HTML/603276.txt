Hello,
I am working on customization for the aspxhtmleditor. For selected tags/formats from the toolbar menu, is there a way to modify the action to set default css classes to specific items?Â I have a declared HtmlEditorCssFile which is applied to content, but has specific classes for most html elements.
For example: On the toolbar there are ordered and unordered lists.  I would like to apply a cssclass to <ol> and <ul> tags by default when they are added. How would I accomplish this?
Thank you.

Hi,
Is there a way to open and access the full Dashboard Data Source Wizard, say at the click of a simple button on a form?Â 
i.e. all pages going from Data source type -> Connection Parameters ->  Query Builder -> Parameters -> Finish
I've seen that you can create a SqlDataSource and open either the query builder, or connection parameters screens individually using various methods. However I want to be able to run the full wizard and create my data source (SqlDataSource or ExcelDataSource) based on the results. Is this possible?
Apologies if a similar question has already  been answered, but I haven't been able to find it.
Kind Regards,
Geoff

Dear Devexpress Team,
I have a serious Problem with one ofÂ  my Projects.
To demonstrate the behaviour, I have created a small Demo. See attachment. 
Pleas change the Connectionstring to the AdventureWorks DB to run the Demo.
The Grid loads a list of Documents.
When you click the rows, Clientside FocusedRowChanged is fired. 
For convenience, on each FocusedRowChanged an alert is triggered.
The Button below the Grid changes alternating row 1 so the record does not  fit or fit the Grid's filter condition.
Hence the record is not shown after a Refresh.
Problem:
The Grid's Focus is now on a different row, but FocusedRowChanged  is NOT fired.
Can you please Review this Situation?
Thank you very much. 
Juergen

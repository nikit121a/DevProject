I have a non persistent action parameter that works with a popup action.
The action parameter contains both a bool and a double value.
There is an appearance rule on the double value to set it to enabled = false when the bool is set to false.
However when the popup action is initialised the appearance rule does not seem to take affect.
It requires the user to toggle the bool on and off again before the appearance rule runs as expected.
Any feedback would be appreciated.

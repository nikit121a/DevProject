Hi,Â 
I have a grid with a DateTime column.
I need the "UseMaskBehavoir " attribute to be set to true beacuse i would like to don't make the user digit directly slashes
But if  "UseMaskBehavoir " attribute is set to true, when i leave the cell after deleting the value (by keyboard or clear-button) the text displayed remains 01/01/0100 instead of blank.
There's a way to display nothing instead of  01/01/0100 when the field is cleared ?
Please correct my attached example.
Thanks  a lot

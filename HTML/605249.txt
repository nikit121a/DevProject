Hi there,
In our system we have someÂ code that can dynamically hide or show certain controls on a form  based on a context and I am trying to get it to work for DevExpress components. I want to use LayoutControl items on my form as it seems the easiest and most flexible way to add components, but I noticed a bug where changing a layout item's visibility is actually affecting the visibility of other components on the form!
I was able to reproduce this with the following simple example. I have 2 text edit controls on a form each inside a layout item. I set the visibility of the controls first then go back and set the visibility of the layout item containers based on their control's visibility.
It never gets to the showmessage because the visibility of cxTextEdit1 has been reset after the 3rd line of code!

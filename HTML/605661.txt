Hi,
I have created one DevExpress report.
In a preview mode it works fine. it shows the parameter and gives me the option to select multiple values including select ALL on top.
but when i run the report in browser, i dont see select all option.
how can i enable select all option there in parameter.
i have placed some screen pictures here

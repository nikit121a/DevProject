When I use 
control a dropdown along with edit box on left appears as shown in attatchment.
At present when I click on dropdown than Calendar appears and we can select date from it
What I want is that when we click on left one edit box too, the calendar should appear which is not happening at present  
i.e. on click of anywhere on 
control 
calendar should appear from which I can select date ?
Also I am not able to find property 
as suggested by you earlier

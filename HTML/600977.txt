Thank you, this has led me in the correct direction.  I've kind of got what I want sort of working, if it's ok I have just a couple of follow-on questions (maybe just clarifications from the documentation):
b) Is there a good reference document on the internal layout/structure of the DevExpress components themselves?  I'm using this code from your solution but I need to include an animated image at certain times.  I thought I could just modify or add another button to the buttons list but the DevExpress button objects don't support animation.  So I need to insert a standard form image object into the component, for example, after the editor buttons list.  But I'm not entirely clear how to access the raw control set that makes up the PopupContainerEdit or how to manipulate its layout in a derived component instance.

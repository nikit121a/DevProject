Hello Support Team,
I activated the grouping count feature with
which leads into the attached result. All data rows are counted which are within this group.
In my case I need to show the amount the amount of children . So looking at my screenshot, I need to show a count of 2, because I have two children.
How can this be done?
Thanks for your help,
Markus

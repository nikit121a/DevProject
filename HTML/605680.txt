Hello,
Â 
My name is Jacob and my account: jacob@bigjewelers.com.
The business requires to have dtTagbox with the large number or items.
I can assign datasource or items to json data on the client and if it needs to be on the server side i can do it as well.
So, if I just do that it takes to long just to open the list.
I tried setup infinite scrolling and it does not work. I am a new to your tools. And there is no exact example how to do it. 
As i mentioned, i have data as json on the client  side.
Please help me to get this done.
I can give you my code example:
Thank you an advance,
Jacob Markel

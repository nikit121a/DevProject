Using the Web - Editor aspect of the Dashboard control, I can add a Textbox to my dashboard.  To this dashboard I can add N number of data bound values to it.  How can I access these Values in the textbox?  Additionally I would like to add the Parameters that were selected as well, to this textbox. I have researched and saw many ways to accomplish this in the WinForm version of the Dashboard, but none showed how to accomplish this for the Web version of the dashboard.  
To expound, I have the value of 
TotalSales (sum)   added to the Values section and then I have parameters of StartDate1 and EndDate 1 I would like to access as well, to present the line
The Total sales for the dates of +Start Date thru +EndDate1 was $+TotalSales (Sum)
Can you show me how to accomplish this
thank you
Todd

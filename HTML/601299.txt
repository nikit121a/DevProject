i have a ribbon control and docklayoutmanager in my wpf mainwindow...
i have it set up to allow me to drag a document from the window and dock it onto the desktop or just leave it floaing,..
the problem i am having, is if i have '2' documents open, 1 is floating or docked on the desktop, the other is docked within the mainwindow,...
if i select the floating ( or desktop docked ) document, then click on a command or checkbox, basically anywhere on the ribbon, 
it will change the active document from the floating document to the document within the mainwindow, 
my goal is to NOT have the ribbon change document activity ( focus etc... ) when clicking on it...
basically if i don't select the document via mouse or ctrl+tab, then the document should not get focus...
any help would be appreciated :)...
Thanks,
Dan

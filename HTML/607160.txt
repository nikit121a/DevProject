Hello DevExpress Team, 
I am using a TreeView as a content template for a dropdown box. 
To make the TreeView update its content automatically depending on the selection of another dropdown box 
I bound the datasource of the TreeView to a knockout observable. 
My code works so far as the observable is updated, but the TreeView shown in the dropdown box is not. 
What are possible issues causing this problem or are there any alternatives to knockout observables?
Thanks in advance.
Sincerely 
Hendrik

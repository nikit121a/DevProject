Hello,
The methods "StoreToIniFile"  and "RestoreFromIniFile" is not working in some situations.
Steps to reproduce de problem (with the attached sample project):
1 - Open the application;
2 - Right-click in "Grand Total" and select "Sort "cxPivotGrid1Field2" by This Column"  as you can see in the attached image "step2.png";
3 -  Click in "Button1";
4 - Close the application;
5 - Open the application;
6 - Click in "Button2 ";
Now, the layout should be restored, but, it not occurs. 
Could you help me with this case?
Thank you.
Alexandre da Silva.

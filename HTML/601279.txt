Hello,
I am trying to change the  ColumnEdit of a BandedGridColumn to a ComboBoxEdit. 
However the displayed Value is always null, no matter what I do.
First I set up my cell editor like that:
then I am dynamically generating my grid and for every BandedGridColumn I try to assign this editor by:
 
The Values can be edited, but the DisplayText is always "null"
 [CaptureSelectCell.png]
however when I enter edit mode, the Value is displayed correctly, I can also edit it and the value is also correctly set
 [CaptureEditMode.png]
when the edit mode is exited, null will be displayed again.
the same behaviour is without handling CustomDisplayText(empty cell instead of "null")

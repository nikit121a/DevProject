Hello,
I'm having to work out several problems relative to using the Chrome browser instead of Internet Explorer.
This particular problem has to do with when a ASPxPopupControl is shown  and the content page has a Callback panel.
And inside that panel is a tableÂ that surrounds other  controls, etc. and is also used get focus onload.
The focus works in IE and Firefox but not in Chrome and Edge.
I've attached a test project that displays the problem.
Thanks, Jack

Good morning, 
I am developing my application using XAF and in the web application I created a custom view to represent the data contained inside of an XML document. I can display the node attributes without any problem by adding a TreeListTextColumn with the FieldName = attribute name. I wanted to know if it was possible to add a column that displayed the tag name of the node, for example:
the treelist would show:
- dvs 
 347
    - vrb 
355
        - idf 
 355
    - pgh 
 367
        - pgh 
 1337
          - pgh 
 1350
The following is the markup of what I have so far:
Thanks,
Pablo.

I use the following connection string to connect my XPO data layer to a database file:
This works file, but these days I decided to move my database file to a shared folder:
It is throwing DevExpress.Xpo.DB.Exceptions.UnableToOpenDatabaseException:
Erro: 'System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteException (0x80004005): unable to open database file
How can I connect XPO to a sqlite batabase file stored in a shared folder?
P.S.: when I map a drive letter to the shared folder and use the mapped path, the connection works. However, I would like to use the shared path.

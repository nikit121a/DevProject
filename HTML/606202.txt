Hello,
i have a XtraGrid which display some values:
Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3
1              |  1              | 1
2              | 2               | 2
The values in the grid are changing in a very short time span (for example every 10 ms).
Now it should be possible for the user to define the column width by left click on the space between two headers and drag and drop  to the wanted width.
When the data are not changing it is not a problem, but when they change the user can't do that.
 I have tried some ways (not on the same time)
 on Mouse down event of the GridControl
1.) set DataSource = null,
 On Mouse down event of the GridView:
1.) BeginUpdate
2.) BeginDataUpdate
On the Mouse up event i have reverse every try. 
 How does i make it correctly?
Best Regards
Stefan

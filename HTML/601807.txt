We are implementing a custom header and sort buttons for a mobile web application, but sorting does not seem to work.
Here is a jsfiddle to demonstrate the issue. If you set theÂ showColumnHeaders to true, sorting will work. But when it is false, it does not!
 
Can you please let us know how to resolve this issue?
 Thank you

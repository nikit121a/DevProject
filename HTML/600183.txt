Hi Guys,
I'm currently experiencing a strange behaviour while using the PropertyGridControl.
I have the following property definition:
 The rendering of the template looks like disabled (in grey color) even if it is possible to edit the property. Please see the attached image. How I can change the appearance of the property?Â 
Br,

Hi,
I build a application with the Devexpress WinForms Components.
The application is running without any problem on normal PCs,  
On release the application should run on a terminal server, where the users can connect to with the remote desktop application (RDP).
The application keeps randomly freezing on the terminal servers for the users connect with RDP.
Do you know if there are any problems with the UI Components for terminal use?
I know about the problem with the popup controls and solved it with the following code:
Are there other configurations or sources of errors IÂ have to consider?
neither my applicationlogs or the windows eventlogs gave me any useful hints for the reasons behind this freezes.
Thank you in advance

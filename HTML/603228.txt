A data grid using a custom data store is to only be viewed some of the time. I'd like to defer the load until I know that the user is going to be viewing the grid.
How do I modify a data store to return an empty array, as in that previous answer?
Using DevExpress.data.AspNet.createStore()
Blanking the load URL until the condition is met (and then calling refresh) does not work, the page itself is called instead.

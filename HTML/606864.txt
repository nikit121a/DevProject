I have a TcxGrid with a TdxServerModeFireDACDataSource, and I want to add a where-part to the query programmatically.  Let's say I only want to show rows "where fylkesnr=4".  I can do this with cxGrid<>ServerModeTableView1.DataController.Filter.Root.AddItem, but the user can change the filter afterwards and then access illegal rows.  What's the best way to filter the rows permanently?

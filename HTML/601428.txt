We just converted our OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDIalog calls to use the new XtraOpenFileDialog and XtraSaveFileDialog.  We've noticed that the Breadcrumb address bar doesn't work right when viewing a folder on a mapped network drive.  If you click one of the folders in the middle of the path, the address does not change to that folder.  For example, if the current path is I:\Folder1\Folder2\Folder2\Folder4, then clicking on Folder 2 should switch to I:\Folder1\Folder2,  but it doesn't do anything.  The drop down menus for each folder segment work ok.
If we do the same test on folders on the C:\ drive, they work fine.

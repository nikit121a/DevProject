Hi everyone
We are currently examining how we could integrate your DevExtreme Product into our Web-Projects. In the process, we had some trouble with the DataGrid in combination with an OData service (created with your Wizard).
This is our basic setup:
ODataContext:
Datasources:
DataGrid:
Our Car objects have a CarType, which is an Object on its own. So we set the "expand" property on the Car datasource and use a lookup for the CarType which has its own datasource. Loading and displaying of the data works as expected.
The only problem now is, as soon as we change the CarType of a Car in the row's lookup, saving the changes fails.
Analysing the network requests tells me, that such a change tries to update the ID of the child object CarType, which results in an error message from the OData Service, stating "Deep Updates are not supported...". I expected it to update the ForeignKey "CarTypeId" on the parent object.
I assume we are using these components a wrong way or missed some configurations. Using the CarType object itself as the dataField and setting "valueExpr" to "this" didn't work either.
 Could you please give us a hint to how we can achieve the expected behaviour?
Thank you very much and best regards
David

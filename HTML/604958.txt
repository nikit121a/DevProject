Hi, 
I'm using the control SpreadsheetControl in my WPF application and I'm facing an issue.
If I try to save a file using the "Save As" button and the already existing selected file is locked by another program, the application crashes. 
Note: same behavior happen in demo app from your demo center.
Thank you in advance for the help.
BR,
Francesco

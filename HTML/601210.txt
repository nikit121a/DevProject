Hi,
I am using XtraReport control to show report.
I have one total which is report total. I need to show another total after discounts     
My net total line is XrLabel11.  I am setting below code after i calculated totals.
Private Sub cTotBid_SummaryCalculated(sender As Object, e As TextFormatEventArgs) Handles cTotBid.SummaryCalculated
        If Me.XrLblCapShipName.Text = "INVOICE FOR:" Then
            ReportBidTotal = ClsCommon.ZCDbl(e.Value)
            Me.XrLabel11.Text = (ReportBidTotal-RBMain.AgreedPC.Amount).ToString("N2")
        End If
   End Sub
This code is not updating the label text .
Could you please explain how to achieve this.

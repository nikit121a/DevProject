Hello,
let we have flow of with following characteristics:
* Buy or Sell
* Currency
* Volume
I need to visualize structure of this flow taking into account both Buy/Sell and Currency, e.g.
Buy
 - USD/RUB: 100
 - EUR/USD: 250
Sell
 - USD/RUB:120
 - EUR/USD: 300
 - CNY/USD: 120
I'm thinking about two half-pie-charts:
* Two half-pie-charts, let left one half represents structure of Buy flow and right one represents structure of Sell flow
* Halves have different squares (square = flow volume)
(see attached image)
How to do it with DevExtreme?

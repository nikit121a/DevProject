Hi,
I am using the DxDataGrid component in an Angular app, to display some information, most of which is calculated "on-the-fly". This means that most cells in the DxDataGrid do not have fixed values - they have a dxTemplate set, which is calling a function in the components' source file. The component whose markup contains the DxDataGrid has its' change detection strategy set to 
.
The markup looks something like this:
The 
method simply returns a string:
Now, whenever 
 - namely the click event on the heading - all values in the cells in the DxDataGrid are being recalculated and the 
function is being called. Since the event fired (clicking the heading) does in NO way affect the data displayed in the DxDataGrid, I see no reason for the values to be recalculated.
Is this the intended behaviour of the component?Â If it is, is there a way to prevent the values from being recalculated? Since I'm trying to display quite a lot of data, I would like the cells to be redrawn/recalculated only when the data bound to the DxDataGrid actually changes.

Hello,
I am using a LayoutPanel.CaptionTemplate to display a custom Caption in a LayoutPanel.
I want to have only a text as Caption when the LayoutPanel is collapsed.
When the LayoutPanel is expanded I want to have also a button near the text in Caption ( I don't want to see the button whenÂ the LayoutPanel is collapsed).
I attached the sample. Can you correct it to work as expected?
Best regards,
Radu Olteanu

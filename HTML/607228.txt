In picture 'discrete.jpg' only the labels with a value are shown. That`s exactly what I am trying to achieve, except from one thing.
The problem is all segments between the ticks have the same size, while the datetime interval varies. The perception of time get's lost.
If the argumentType is set to 'continuous', the spacing between ticks is correct, but it is almost impossible to only display the ticks with a value. 
I have tried this by using the customizeText propery and setting the tickInterval and axisDivisionFactor to a very low value.
The problem then is, besides the much longer calculation time, not all labels are shown because empty labels overlap with non-empty labels resulting in no label at all.
If overlappingBehavior is set to 'none', all labels are shown but labels can overlap with nearby labels.
'continuous.jpg' is the result I want, but it would be nice if the labels didn't overlap and the calculation time didn't explode because of the low tickInterval.
Is this combination of showing discrete values in a continuous way possible, or is it possible to implement this as a feature

Hello Devexpress Team,
we want to switch from our old Reporting Tool to XtraReports.
In both ways we create PDF's from the reports.
Everything we tried works fine so far, but we have one problem.
We have to find a way to send a report by Fax.
In our old Solution this works with a Fax-String, which is integrated in the Report.
The Fax Printer parses that String, which contains the number and does the work.
This does not work with DX Reports. The Fax String cannot be parsed out of the generated *.ps File.
Yes, I already read this ticket:
Is there any way, for example by using a certain report control, to make text readable in the postscript file?
Or do you have any other suggestions for sending XtraReports by Fax?Â 
Best Regards,
Philipp

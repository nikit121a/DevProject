Hi
This is the first time I have tried to create a ComboBoxEdit in a GridControl and I'm struggling with it.
I have a GridControl bound to a collection. One of the items in this collection is an int called 'PossibleMatchId' and it has it's own column.
In this column I want to present a ComboBoxEdit, which will have an ItemsSource that changes when the selected row is changed. This item source is called 'PossibleMatches' and I have code that refreshes this collection when the selected row is changed. The property in this collection I wish to display to the user is 'DisplayString', the value that I wish to use is called 'ID' and I wish to connect this 'ID' value in the items source to the 'PossibleMatchId' in the items source of the grid.
This is a snippet of my code:
<dxg:GridColumn Header="Possible Existing Match"  FieldName="PossibleMatchId" AllowEditing="True" >
  <dxg:GridColumn.EditSettings>
      <dxe:ComboBoxEditSettings ItemsSource="{Binding PossibleMatches}" DisplayMember="DisplayString" ValueMember="ID">
          <dxe:ComboBoxEditSettings.StyleSettings>
            <dxe:ComboBoxStyleSettings/>
           </dxe:ComboBoxEditSettings.StyleSettings>
         </dxe:ComboBoxEditSettings>
       </dxg:GridColumn.EditSettings>
</dxg:GridColumn>
Currently there are no values displayed in this column (if I remove the value for 'ValueMember' the values are displayed). If I click on the column I get the combo box and it has the right values in it for the selected row. When I selected a value I see the value in the cell, but when I click away the value is gone again. So my main problem here is connecting the value in the ComboBoxEdit items source with the value in the grid items source.
Any advice appreciated!

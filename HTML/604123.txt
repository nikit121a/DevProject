Hi DevExpress Team,
   
    We have Gridview with some column Date columns (ColumnType as DateEdit).
   
    Header filter for Date columns is not working as expected and throwing NotSupported Exception from entity framework.
    When clicking on Header filter button, we can see the drop-down, without any FilterValue items.
    For other type of columns its working fine, and we can see the available filter value,
    We have already tried the solution from below link, still unable to use Header filter for the Date column. 
     Version Details -
      
     DevExpress version - 16.2.5.0
     Entity Framework -  6.0.0.0
   
Thanks,
Shanki

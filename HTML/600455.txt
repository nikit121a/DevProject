Hi!
After update to 17.2.4 version.. do you have idea why em some clients, using IE11 or EDGE, dashboard open blank?
- how if "dataloading"event not fired..
but, is for some clients.. here for me, open correct...
do you can to test in our test site:

click em dashboard..
In some machines, open correct (IE11 oe EDGE), but in others machine, not open...!

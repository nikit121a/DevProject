Hi,
I have a property list of dataview. While iterating through a list, I map "dataview = table.defaultView". 
I add this dataview to the list of dataViews( say the property name is ListDataView). On xaml, I bind these properties to itemsource of grid.
eg :itemsource={ binding Â ListDataView}.
I want to display all the tables in dataset one below the other which are present in dataView List.
Can you please help me asap, inorder to achieve this.

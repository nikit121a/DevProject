Good morning.
We are considering using Test Caf?.
I see that the current DevExpress has not been update for a long time (although is the one linked on your site) because you have a new one: 
Will the new one replace totally the existing one? Is the new one ready to use?
In the new page it says it is free and open source. Will the full product will be free or there will be a free version and a paid version with additional features?
Regards

Is there a validation summary control for the DevEx ASP.NET Bootstrap controls similar to the Validation Summary control for the regular ASP.NET DevEx controls (ASPxValidationSummary)?  I can see that a validation group can be specified in the validation settings for the Bootstrap controls.  If there is not a Bootstrap Validation Summary control, can you please explain the recommended approach to displaying validation summary information on a responsive asp.net page?   Please include a working code sample.

Hi,
 
We have a product where we allow the user to bring up the Chart Wizard (see 
) to customize the chart. The product is developed using DevExpress WinForms. 
 
Now we have a similar product under development, where we use DevExpress WPF instead. Is there any way to bring up the Chart Wizard in WPF? Or is there another way for the end-user to customize the chart?
Rgds,
Petter Ballandby

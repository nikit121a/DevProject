I have a report created and to print it I use this code :
            XtraReportDriverRemarks report = new XtraReportDriverRemarks();
            report.PrintDialog();
The report is declared like this 
    public partial class XtraReportDriverRemarks : DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport
Now I am moving this report to another project, but there it keeps saying the PrintDialog() method does not exists.
How can I fix this ?

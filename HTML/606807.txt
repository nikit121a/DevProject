I have a softball question.  I want to create a fairly simple ASP.NET form to allow my users to input some fields, click a submit button, and update a database.  I can handle all of the validation, database stuff, etc., but believe or not I am getting stuck on the "best" way to layout the controls (textboxes, labels, buttons) on my Webform.  I could call old school and use a HTML-tables, but it seems like I am missing a really cool control in my arsenal.  Is it Panels, Formviews, what?  Obviously, I would love to just be able to drag controls and place them.
Can you just guide me a bit on one or two of the best ways to accomplish this with my DevExpress toolbox?  Thanks!

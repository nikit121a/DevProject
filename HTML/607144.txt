I'm having trouble converting a mouse pointer location to a pdf textbox location in a pdf viewer.
I know i'm close... BUT
Here is my code... when i let go of the mouse button, i want to get the location and create a textbox at that location.
I'm using the pdfdocumentprocess and viewer in tandem to attempt this.  But Cursor points to PDF points not working correctly
I've tried different ways... but the text box either doesn't show up at all OR the textbox shows up in a different place.  Cursor Position is NOT equaling the pdf position.
Thanks very much for any help!

Hello! I had the following problem situation:
1) The following line is stored in the xml form settings file:




2) In the program, the date (01.11.2017) from this file is correctly read and saved in a string. The value 01.11.2017 is stored in the line. Next I assign this value to my DataEdit :



where 
is string with the correct date value,  
 is DataEdit.
3) Next, a form opens on which the dtpPeriodFrom date is displayed correctly, that is, the value is displayed 
. 
4) Next, when I click on an element or click on a black triangle, the value in dtpPeriodFrom is displayed as 
, which is incorrect.
5) Then when I shift focus to another element the value dtpPeriodFrom to become true, i.e. 
.
: how to correct this situation so that in both cases the dtpPeriodFrom value is displayed as 11.01.2017.
: In the attached video file, I showed this problem in detail.

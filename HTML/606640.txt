when setting displayformat string on creating datecolumn it still shows deafult formatstring
same for settingsheaderfilter mode thats not changing either
this happens in the page.init handler




Â i hope you can help
UPDATE: i just found out that in the database i use a varchar field .
when i change that to datetime its fixed,
but i cant change it because it can be text or datetime depends on a setting

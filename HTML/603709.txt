Hi team,
The aspxSpreadsheet control is quite useful to us. Meanwhile we have some thoughts to beautify it or to make it a nicer look. Therefore we have a few questions here. If you can help or provide some suggestions, that will be appreciated!
For all these questions, you can always the your online demo for reference
1. To start with a simple one, can we adjust aspxSpreadsheet width and height?
Thank you!
Best,
Jiong

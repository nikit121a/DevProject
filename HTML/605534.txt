Hello,
I used with your control propertyGrid and I bound control list to the selected object property and everything works well,  perfectly.
I have problem that my application works slowly.
During The application life the control list is changed a lot of times, and I found that when I canceled the binding (of the control list to the propertyGrid control)
the application worked quickly.
Do you have any solution for me, how can I use with the propertyGrid and change the list wich is bind to it and the application will continue to work quickly.
thanks
rose rose :)Â

Hello,
I have a dxScheduler with an initial dataSource empty (dataSource: null).
I would like to populate the scheduler with data depending on a select option, with the following Javascript:
const myScheduler = document.getElementById("scheduler");
fetch(calendarDataUrl).then(data => {
        return data.json();
    }).then(result => {
        // the refresh of scheduler data here
        myScheduler. ????????
   });
What is the best way to populate the scheduler with the newly fetched data?
A related question, we would like to re-populate another scheduler with newly fetched monthly data on a month-change click event. How could this be accomplished?
NB! We are using straight Javascript/jQuery, no Angular.
Regards,
Joar Olsen

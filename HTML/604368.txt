Hi,
in my grid I setÂ  a fixed group with follwing code:
Is it possible to pass a tag or hidden/not visible content to the group also? (Content of another column)
Also I need to check wether a row or a group was clicked. I tried with MouseDown event:
If GroupRow: How can I get the text or tag of the selected group?
If Datarow: How can I get the text or tag of the superordinated group?
Thank You for your help

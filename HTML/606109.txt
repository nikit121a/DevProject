We are converting all our javascript code to typescript, including the code where we utilize devExtreme.
We are getting errors with the following command 
function newIOIDataGrid(_config) {
    return $("#dxDataGridContainer").dxDataGrid(_config).dxDataGrid("instance");
}
where _config is a object containing the configuration for the datagrid.
The error :
Error TS2339 Property 'dxDataGrid' does not exist on type 'dxDataGrid'. 
A colleague tried the followiing code to replace the return statement in the above function, but as I expected, that doesn't work
return (<DevExpress.ui.dxDataGrid>DataGrid).instance();
Any thoughts on how to deal with this situation. Please note that we currently chain together functions in a similar for a number of different widgets, like dxPopup and dxButton . I suspect the solution would apply to any devExtreme widget.
Thanks

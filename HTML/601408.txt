I have a general question regarding using the: RowCellStyle(object sender, DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.RowCellStyleEventArgs e)
vs. using format rules.
I started to notice some funky behavior using RowCellStyle and when I switched to the format rules, it seemed to clear it up.
Is there a best-practice to follow or a guideline on which to use and when?
Thanks in advance,
-Mark

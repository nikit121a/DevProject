Attached I send you the new version of the program, "Source" folder, program data, "Database" folder" and file Word ToHelp2 with the procedure step by step, to reproduce the problems. My questions are:
   1) How can I close one grid detail row that is in edition when the user change to another grid?
 
   Thanks in advance

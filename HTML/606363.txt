Hi,
Â I am using MVC grid with filtering functionality.
Filter is not getting enable after clearing it if manually disabled last time
Current Behavior:
Step 1: Remove tick of filter manually
Step 2: Clear filter
Step 3: Search any value from column search
Filter not applied because last time user had manually removed tick

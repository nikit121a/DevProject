Hi!
I am generating Excel Spreadsheets with double values and would like to format a cell with white spaces and currency according to the following format
3333 -> 3 333 kr
150000,32 -> 150 000,32 kr
2132222,34 -> 2 132 222,34 kr
Am trying to using the NumberFormat like this
But it doesn't seem to work. Can you please advice.
Thx!

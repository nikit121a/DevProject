Editing a timespan within DevExpress Gridview today is not supported and requires custom programming for developers.
As DevExpress is useful to improve productivity of software developers I expect it to support this SQL Server datatypes.
Would you please prioritize this and add it to development backlog ?
Can you please provide a workaround for the time being?
We need this working in an ASP.NET MVC Gridview.
Thanks in advance!

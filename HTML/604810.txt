Hi, DevExpress Team!
 
 I'm using XAF Web Application for a while.
 
 I need to create document for print from template (rtf) with SimpleAction. For this I'm using RichEditDocumentServer:
Since Web App is used, it's not possible to launch the document directly on the client (System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(path);).
Could you please adwise what is the best way to launch or print the document ?
I suppose there are two ways:
1. To create AspxRichEdit PropertyEditor, to add protperty EditorAlias("RTF") to my class and to save my document's data into the protperty:
 
 The only example to create RichEdit PropertyEditor I found  is made for win app, but not for web (
). So, how can I do it for Web ?
2. To create WebRichEditUserControl.ascx, called it when the document is created and then open the document in it.
How can I open WebRichEditUserControl.ascx from code and to input parametrs in to WebRichEditUserControl.ascx (path to the document file) ?
That do you think ? Can you advise somthing else ?

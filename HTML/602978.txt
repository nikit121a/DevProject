Hello,
I'm migrating an old project to use XAF.
I've created a code-first from database EF assembly which contains  the business class to access my existing database.
I've referenced this data model assembly into the XAF's main module, renamed the HashSet to List etc.
So far, I can access data in a list view.
As Visual studio wizard to import the database was not aware of all field names, I got some properties with unusefull names like Contact and Contact 1 for two references to a Contact table (i.e. Contact is in fact SalesContact and Contact1 is TechnicalContact), so I renamed the virtual properties in the code-first model.
My problem is that whatever I try, XAF's BO model continues to have  two items named Contact and Contact1. I was expecting that after a rebuild and UpdateModel I would see SalesContact and TechnicalContact.
Also I made another test, I renamed a real field  (a column in the table). here again, the BOModel remains with the old name; but when I run the view, I see the new column name even if it is not included in the model's view (like if the field is found and added because the model does not contains a reference to hide it)
What should I make to ensure that the properties name are correctly updated to reflect the current data model  ?
Thanks

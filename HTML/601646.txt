Hi
My client is trying to install the report server but is not getting the installer window, the installer shows up without problems on windows 7.
We have made sure that :
- Smartscreen is disabled.
- The file is not blocked since it  was downloaded from the internet.
- All antivirusses are disabled.
We also checked the eventviewer for any signs of problems but could not find any. 
When we check the taskmgr we can see the installer but no UI is provided (attached screenshot).
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

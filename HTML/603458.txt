Hi,
In a DBTableGrid I have two columns of Property "DateEdit" . Both also show time.
Of the two only date and time of Enddatetime can be changed. 
After the user pressed on the OK-button in the dateedit-editor, the entered date must be validated.  Column Enddatetime  must always be after  Startdatetime.
If the date/time is not valid I want to keep the inplace DateEdit-editor open or re-open it (see attached image).
The code below does place the editor in the column, but it doesn't show the DateEdit-editor.
 Ideally when pressing the OK-button in de DateEdit-editor the date will be validated and if not valid a errormessage is shown and the editor remains open.
Thanks!

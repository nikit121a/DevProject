 Attached is a lousy sample project, but it will do the job for explaining the problem I have with a real application.
Focus on the date and time fields on the detail form - upper part. These are binded to the same property in our ViewModel - users want to have two controls, one for the date and one for the timepart.
In codebehind an event fires if time entered is more than five minutes old. Then a suggestion of changing the date to next day will appear as messagebox - see attachment, word-doc.
The event fires correctly, but what's displayed in the time field behind the messagebox is a little bit out of sync, and I can't figure out why, or what to do for that matter.
To illustrate
Time Now: 15:36
I enter: 15:31
Field displays: 15:03
The control will let me type 15:31 (or just 31 in the last two positions), but when the messagebox displays, the content  which is displayed 15:03? At the same time the EditValue has the right value otherwise the event would not trigger.
EditValueChanged with this type of binding is troublesome. User should have full freedom of typing until he or she leaves the field. An old tool I used in the past had what they called a Validate Event: Captured 'FocusLost' and 'ValueChanged' in one event.
I also tried to modify the binding: UpdateSourceTrigger=LostFocus. No different behaviour 
Thanks in advance for any help.

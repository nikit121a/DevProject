Dear Support,
i have a question regarding XRPictureBox.
Currently I am having a list of List<Bitmap> objects which I would like to Show, and everything works fine if I Show only Images...but i am having the following Scenario...
1 . I am creating one XRTable and filling out the Content from my objects, (the rows in XRTable can be different)
2. under this table i Need to Show the list of Images, but, if there is some space below the table i should Show two images  (one next to eachother), on the new page i have to ShowÂ  Images ( as a Matrix 2x2) and if the Image is bigger of 1000px i should Show only this Image on the page....
is there any possibility to set up the XRPictureBox holder to be more flexible ?
Thank you in advance for your time and effort.
Regards
Nikola

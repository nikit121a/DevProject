Hi,
I have a  table in the sheet and i set a formula using some column off the table (button1)
Then i delete the Table for change the datasourse, and create the "same" table.  (button2)
Then 2 things happens:
1 -Â  the formula is change to a wrong address
2 - one row is insert at the botton of the new table.
How can i avoid this situation?
Thanks

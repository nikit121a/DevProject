Hi,
I'm migrating an application to XAF.
I would like to create a sales-quote  editor, having on the left the list of catalogitems and on the right the list of items selected for this sales quote.
The way I found doing this is to create a detail view for the quote, with a master-detail view listing the quote's items (on the right)
The list of catalog items available is not related to the items of the quote, so to add it to the quote detail view, I added to the left a DashboardViewItem  and linked that dashboard view item to a list view of my catalog table.
I now need to do the following:
Add a filter to limit the catalog items to a specific category. I'd like to have a drop-down com bo with the catalog items categories and then filter the catalog list view based on the selected category.
I looked around the filters available in XAF (either the row filter embedded in the grid, but it does not comes with a list of categories, I need to type it which is not user friendly), other option is to create grid filters but it is also  not as easy sas just having a combo on top of the list.
So, is there a way to add a combo containing the contents of a category table, then have a filter of the list view based on the selected item of the combo ?
Thanks

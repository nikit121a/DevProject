Hi,
I'm editing an object (typeA) where I'd like to have a property of another XPObjectBase descendant (typeB) .
If I put the Aggregated attribute on the simple Property (not a collection) of typeB, the model of the typeA is created without that specific property but with many properties (the properties of the typeB class).
This way I can't develop a Custom Property Editor for editing in a special UI way the typeB .
Have you got any suggestion on how can I handle a One to One aggregated relation?

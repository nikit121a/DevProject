Attached you can find a demo project that i've made to demonstrate the problem, if you press the "draw RightAngle" button, ConnectorPointRestrictions are respected but connectors are easily overlapping. If instead you press "draw Curved" button, ConnectorPointRestrictions are not respected.
In this sample you can also notice why i was asking for adding empty space between the diagram and first shape, as you can see when you use RightAngle, connectors are drawed outside of the diagram grid.
My perfect solution is to have RightAngle connectors that do not overlap, more space between shapes and space from diagram borders and first shape, but i can give a try to curved connectors if i'm able to make them respect ConnectorPointRestrictions.

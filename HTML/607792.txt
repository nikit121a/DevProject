Hi,
How can I do to fix this issue:
Some grid display spcial characters correctly, but others no. Â  For example, the characters "?" and "?" is displayed correctly in the grid "gridComisiones", (please see the attached file) but in the grid "gridJefesSupervisores" a quiestion "?" character is displayed.
I attached web.config, my aspx page and an image to sign the issue.
Thanks in advanced!

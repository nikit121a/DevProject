Hi,
I'm trying to accomplish the following task in XAF.
I have a business object "Printer Settings" . I would like users to select a printer from the printers list and then based on that selection allow user to choose PaperSource for that printer.
I've created 2 custom editors derived from StringPropertyEditor:
1. Shows list of Installed Printers
2. Shows list of available PaperSource for selected printer.
In second property editor'sÂ SetupRepositoryItem method, I need to get access to currently selected Printer in the first property editor, but can't figure out how.
Thanks,
Alex

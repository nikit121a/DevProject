Hello,
I have a question regarding the LayoutView in a grid.
Is there a way to modify the background color of the area between the cards?
We have to set the background to transparent so that the background of the form is shown. We tried to set the Appearance. ViewBackground.BackColor but this has no effect.
We are using the Black-Skin in our application.
Perhaps there is a possibility in code that I'm missing?
Attached you can find a picture. The area I mean is marked.
Thanks

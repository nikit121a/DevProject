Hi guys, I have some further questions stemming from this thread 
;
In my scaffold wizard generated app, I am trying to achieve the following requirements;
- I want to be able to have any view type listed in my NavBarControl (I.e. Others as well as those generated by the scaffold wizard, whether based on an an entity or not.)
- I want to be able to control which modules are open in the DocumentManagerService on application startup
- I want to prevent duplicate documents being opened when the document is a module in the NavBarControl (for example. If I have added one manually to the documentManagerService, I don't want it to be duplicated when I choose it from the NavBarControl)
What is the best approach to achieve that? I could be wrong, but it seems to me that the modules have to be based on entites? I cannot seem to add a module that is just any old viewmodel...I feel that I need to remove the complication and just write something simpler? Would that be a better way to go than trying to modify the wizard's code?
If anyone could point me in the right direction that'd be super helpful
Thank you  
John

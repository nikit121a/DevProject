Hello there
I have an issue with a dockpanel not getting focused when it gets clicked on after leaving an editor who is open in a gridview.
This seems to relate to a setting on the dockmanager : ValidateDockPanelOnDeactivate
If this setting is true, then after the editor closes upon clicking on another dockpanel, the clicked-on dockpanel does not seem to become "focused".
In our application I noticed that the dockpanel actually became active, but it did not look "focused" because the titlebar does not look to be enabled .
Clicking on the dockpanel again caused the "OnActivePanelChanged" on the dockmanager to be fired again (for the same dockpanel).
I created a sample application to demonstrate the issue and also a video, these are attached in a zip.
In the video, I start with this setting turned on and demonstrate that the dockpanels do change their title by clicking between them normally. 
Then the issue is demonstrated where the "dockPanel2 " does not become active after clicking on its titlebar when leaving the editor in the grid in "dockPanel1" (when the editor closes).
I then turn this setting off by commenting out the line in my test-project and run it again where you now can see the desired behaviour.
I want to have this setting enabled but still allow the second dockpanel to appear focused when  leaving an editor, how can I accomplish this?
Cheers

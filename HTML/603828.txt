Hello,
     
in the example below you see a dxPivotGrid coupled with a dxChart. Each dxPivotGrid data field uses a different formatting for the displayed values.
In my real app these formatting definitions are not static but derived from some complex conditions. 
The coupled dxChart is to show the value details in its tooltips. How can I achieve that the values in the tooltips of dxChart use the same formattings
as the belonging data columns in the pivot grid. The tooltip property allows just a common format definition for all tooltips but not an individual definition
dependent on the bound data column of the pivot grid.
Best regards 
Matthias

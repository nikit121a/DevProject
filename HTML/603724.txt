Hello,
We use WinForms Grid control with DataSource set. 
DataSet values are doubles, but they should be displayed in a special custom format. 
To achieve it we use CustomColumnDisplayText event.
CustomColumnDisplayText(object sender, DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Base.CustomColumnDisplayTextEventArgs e) 
{
   e.DisplayText = SOMETHING;
}
That works fine but not for edit mode.
In edit mode, editor displays not formatted value. 
To fix it, we use ShownEditor event and set ActiveEditor Text property explicitly: 
GridView_ShownEditor(object sender, EventArgs e) {
   var ae = MyGridView.ActiveEditor as DevExpress.XtraEditors.TextEdit;
   ae.Text = MyGridView.GetFocusedDisplayText(); 
}
That also works. 
However, there is a problem. ShownEditor event raises at the moment when ActiveEditor already placed something (standard double.ToString in our case representation) in the cell. It leads to double drawing and flickering. 
Is it possible to avoid double drawing? 
How can we make ActiveEditor to set Text to proper (formatted) value initially or at least before cell drawing started? 
Thank you,

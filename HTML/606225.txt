Hello!
I need to let user to use named parameters in CriteriaPropertyEditor in XAF Web application.
I have followed 
 and 
 tickets, but named parameters is not reflected in editor UI and property with parameters list is never accessed. Please, see screenshot, illustrating the issue.
How to enable CriteriaPropertyEditor to use filter parameters?
Thank you!

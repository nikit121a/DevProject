dear support,
we have a business requirement to achieve below functionality shown in youtube video.
Â how can we best do it in XAF web applications.
if i have to summarize then:
1. data is shown in a gridview
2. on cell click it opens a popup with specific field and control ( it could be textbox, dropdown, depending upon the field).
3. it is not loading whole detail view.
4. it is saving on the fly and refreshing grid without postback.
5. if i pick columns from column chooser, functionality is applicable to any column whihc is editable in DETAILS VIEW.
6. user security permission to be checked , who can and who cannot change the data.
7. all grid operation should work like filter, sort, search etc.
pls advise how best we can do it in XAF web application project.
Thanks

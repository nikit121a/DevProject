Hi,
I'm using the scheduler control with a custom appointment form.
On the Ok button click i want to check if the values are compliant with a set of rules (located in the database).
Where do i place the validation?
 I tried theÂ frmCustomPlanningForm_Validating event, but it's never called.
If i do it on the ok button click, the record is already written to the database.
Regards,
peter

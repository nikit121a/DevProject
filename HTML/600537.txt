Hi,
I have a dxDataGrid with editing mode: row
I create a dxSelectbox editor in onEditorPreparing.
The editor has a DataSource getting a list from the server.
The value is set with grid.setValue(event.value) in onValueChanged on the dxSelectBox editor.
When the user hits Enter in the grid the rows is set in editmode, thats fine.
But if the user has foucs on a column with a dxSelectBox  editor with a value the value is cleared on entering the editor with enter.
Is not always happing but when it happens the onValueChanged is triggered with value = null. 
I know i can set allowClearing = false, but thats not an option in this case because the user needs to be able to clear.
How can I stop Enter from clearing the value?

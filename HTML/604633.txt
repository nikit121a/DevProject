I have a grid control with a banded grid view with several button edit controls in several columns. I want to disable the buttons on all the repository button edit controls in the row including the one i clicked except for one that i can click and re-enable them back. I'm trying to do this on the repositoryItemButtonEdit_ButtonClick event. If I use repositoryItemButton1.Buttons[0].Enabled = true, it disables the button in all the rows. I just want it to do that for that row i'm on, not the rest. Is there a way to get the repositoryItemButtonEdit's in the row i am on within the button click event?

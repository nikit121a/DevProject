In the demos installed by version 11.2 (usually in the folder C:\Users\Public\Documents\DevExpress 2011.2 Demos\Components\XtraReports\VB), you provide an XtraReports demo with drill-down for WPF forms in ReportWpfDemo\Modules \DrillDown.xaml.vb. However you do not provide the corresponding demo for WIN Forms. There is no ReportMainDemo\DrillDown\PreviewControl.vb. Can you please provide one?

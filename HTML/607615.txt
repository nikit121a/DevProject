I have an application where end users can design reports.  I open the report designer using ReportDesignTool.ShowRibbonDesignerDialog.  The application works when built as x86 ok, but when built as x64 the designer hangs after certain operations.  
In the x64 version, once the designer is open, the user can manipulate some aspects of the design.  But, if (for example) we select a field and try to assign a style, the design hangs and must be killed at the moment of the style selection.
I have tested this error by rebuilding ReportMainDemo solution after building it as x64 platform (rather than Any CPU) in configuration manager.  When the demo is run, there are errors loading SqlLite (which is built for Any CPU), but we can still open the report designer and demonstrate the error as described above.  Contact me if you can not reproduce the error easily.

Hi,
Sequence contains no element exception is thrown in two cases:
Blank file:
- Open print preview
- set page layout  to two pages
- show cover page
Open file:
- Open print preview
- set page layout  to two pages
- show cover page
- close print preview
This also happens in the Text Editor control.
Thanks,
Michael

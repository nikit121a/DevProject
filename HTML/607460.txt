Hello,
     While I'm waiting for my order to be processed, I am using a trial version to get familiar with the DevExtreme controls for .NET Core 2. The issue I'm having is related to MasterDetail configuration using a RemoteContoller. On the child grid, I am trying to pass the ID value to a webservice and everything would work if it wasn't for the extra stuff passed in the query string.
For example:
&_=1519004105944
I don't like having to pass "id=" but that's workable for the most part. The ? character is what's causing me the issue with the grid saying it cannot find the remotecontroller. I would like to simple pass the GUID but I can't figure out how. Any idea's on how to fix this??
Grid Code:

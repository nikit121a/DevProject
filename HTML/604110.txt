Let's say I have 4 fields in the row area. Calling the method PivotGridControl.GetRowIndex(Object[]) works but only if I pass values for the 1st row area field -or- for the 1st and 2nd row area fields. As soon as I add a value for the third field, the result is always -1. I have tried with many different combinations of fields of various data types and the result is always the same.Â

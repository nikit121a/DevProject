The first launch of a report it's taking a long time. 
But the problem occurs every time.
For exemple, we have an application with 2 reports.
The scenario we encounter is the following :
- Launch the application
- Preview report 1 : it takes 10 seconds to show the report preview.
- Close the preview
- preview the report 1 again : it takes 1 second to show the preview
- close the preview
- preview the report 2 : it takes 5 seconds
- close the preview
- preview the report 2 again : it takes 0.5 second.
- close tha application
- launch the application again
- Preview report 1 : it takes 10 seconds to show the report preview.
- Close the preview
- preview the report 1 again : it takes 1 second to show the preview
- and so on ...
Our application is a XAF application.
Will Ngen improve the performance of the 1st preview/print ?
What is the difference between printing report 1 and report 2. Aren't the DLL already compiled at the first preview of report ?
Many thanks in advance for your answer.

  
  Check specified Employees by clicking on Employee's Checked row or by clicking on a whole project (in this case all Employees inside this Project must be checked automatically)
When user checks all Employees, Project must be checked (Checked column)
When user clicks OK button, all the selected Employees must be displayed
  
  When I check Project (Checked column), I need to collapse and expand child table with Employees to repaint it with new values
If I change the Checked state of Employee, I must focus Projects row to repaint and refresh Project checked status
When I select for example two Employees in one project and press OK, I see only one of them, even if unfocused Employee row before (Projects Checked column was updated)
If I select Project, all Employees are selected, but when I click OK button, I dont see it in results list

Hi, I have a form with a grid.
I want to make it so that when user change values in the rows, it automatically saves their changes (by running a sql command to update the database)
Is the best place to do this on the  GridControl LostFocus event?
If so how d o I capture the text cell I am leaving?
GridView1.GetRowCellValue(GridView1.FocusedRowHandle, "Description")
Picks up the cell which is clicked on
Many Thanks

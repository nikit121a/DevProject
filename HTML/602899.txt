Hi,
I want to export a csv file which includes only selection in spreadsheet control. The main problem we are facing is we are not able to ignore a column if it stays among other colums. I have a List<Range> which is correctly selects what i want but we cannot find a way to export as csv file. How can we solve this problem ?
Some code parts not worked  :
1.) Tried to copy selection in newly created worksheet
2.) Also tried to change export settings.

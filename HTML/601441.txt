Hi in my server side code in C# I create an instance of a devexpress xtrreport and then call the print method
ie
now when I test this on my local desktop pc it prints to my default printer.
but when I try from our live website it displays aÂ error that no default printer is installed.I have a default printer installed on the web server too.
I know this is not exactly a devexpress error but any help is appreciated.

Hi.  I have a simple map connected to OpenStreetMapDataProvider and a layer that shows a single callout.
The map is in an XtraUserControl.
This control is the content of a TabbedView document. 
My program no longer exits.  I tried adding a MyUserControl.Dispose on shutdown and it hangs there.
Is there some proper unloading I need to do with maps?
Thanks.

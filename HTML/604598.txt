I am using DevExtreme MVC DataGrid. I need to calculate column and show in the footer.
I have checked documentation and based on it did the changes. 
But it is not doing sum properly.
Below is the code used for summary:

One of my column having data decimal with percentage e.g: 2.70 %
When i applied sum for this column then total calculating sum showing zero.
Could you please suggest some solution for it?

Hi,
I have upgraded my application from MVC4 to MVC5  but I am getting a run time error as below:
An exception of type 'System.TypeAccessException' occurred in System.Web.Mvc.dll but was not handled in user code
Additional information: Attempt by security transparent method 'DevExpress.Web.Mvc.UI.HtmlHelperExtension.DevExpress(System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper`1<!!0>)' to access security critical type 'System.Web.Mvc.HtmlHelper`1<ModelType>' failed.
Assembly 'DevExpress.Web.Mvc.v15.2, Version=15.2.14.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b88d1754d700e49a' is marked with the AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute, and uses the level 2 security transparency model.Â  Level 2 transparency causes all methods in AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers assemblies to become security transparent by default, which may be the cause of this exception.
Can you please suggest what could be the issue and how to solve it?

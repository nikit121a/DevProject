Hello
I have a SuperToolTip with a html-link attached to a BarButtonItem in my RibbonControl. If IÂ place the BarButtonItem directly in the ribbon the link works just fine but if I place that same button in a menu (in a BarSubItem) the HyperlinkClicked-event doesn't fire. I can see the tooltip and the link appears to be clickable but the event wont fire. Is there any way I can get the html-link to work when the button is inside the menu?
Thank you

Hello,
I've tried everything I can think of to get a RepositoryItemProgressBar to show in an XtraGrid column but cannot get it.
Code is below and screenshot of the column with just the value in it instead of the progress bar.  I can get other repository items to work just fine like RepositoryItemHyperLinkEdit but not this.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Code for RepositoryItemHyperLinkEdit that works:
Thank you,
Clay

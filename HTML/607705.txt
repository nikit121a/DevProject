Hi,
I am desperately trying to get a CheckBox column into my TreeList.
I can display the CheckBox but I can't manage to get it editable.
I need it editable as soon as I display the TreeList. 
My current approach isÂ  to set the  DataCellTemplateContent:
But when I display the TreeList I get some javascript error:
How can I get a CheckBox column that is editable right away?
Regards,

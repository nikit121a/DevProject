Hi folks,
i created a BO named DraftState (Properties: Name (string), SortIndex (int)). 
The table is prefilled with 3 draft states . Each draft state as an unique, running number (e.g. 0,1,2).
It is possible for the end user to delete predefined draft state. It should be also allowed to add or reorder draft states.
What is the recommended approach to handle this features? 
To let the user update the sort index via spinEditControl is awful. Maybe there is a better way? 
How can i guarantee, that there is no gap between the sort index values (0,2,3,19), neither duplicated sort index values?
Thanks,
Micha

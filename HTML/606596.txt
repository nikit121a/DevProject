I have a user model per the attached image. User => UserRoles => Role => RolePermissions => Permission
I am trying to write the contains operator that selects users with a specific permission for a specific project. I think I am nearly there, but the following doesnt work because the contains query is on the userroles, not the role. I just don't know how to make that last connection - could you please correct it for me?
I thought it was analogous toÂ 
 but I am missing something.

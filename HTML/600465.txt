Hi, I want to use the Accordion control to make a navigation bar like the one in the attached screenshot.When it is minimized I want it to show the text below the icon and I cant seem to find a way of doing it. I want it to look like the one shown in the attached image as this is what we use on our web client and I want the Windows ApplicationÂ to match. I thought about using a label control as the header control and changing the image alignment when it is minimized but they dont show when minimized and you cant click on the label to open the group. Any help will be much apreciated

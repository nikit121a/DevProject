Hi,
I'm building a timeline Scheduler similiar to your exemple here:
I'm using the "onOptionChanged" method to find out when the users changes the "currentDate" or the "currentView". However. I wanted to know wich date did he change to. 
For exemple: If I am on "timelineWeek" or "timelineMonth" in March and change to "timelineDay" I want to know to witch day it will change to.
If I try to do "getStartViewDate()" it will only work after the "onOptionChanged" is finished.
Is there any way I can obtain this information?
Thank you.

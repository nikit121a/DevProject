Hello,
I cannot find any working example on how to confirm delete from client side. 
I wrote below code but it does nothing because once this confrimation button appears, it is too late, appoitment already deleted!
Any idea how to do this?
By the way, I can tell you that documentation on MVC Scheduler is weaker than others. It took my 2 days to add just one extra field on popup window.

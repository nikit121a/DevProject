Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a new RibbonForm project.
2. Add couple of hoverable items to the  ribbon (for instance: buttons).
3. Run the app.
4.  Try do drag the application menu button out of the Ribbon (place the cursor over application button, press LMB, move the cursor below the ribbon, release LMB).
5. Move the mouse over the Ribbon items.
Expected result:
Items indicate they're hovered 
Actual result:
Items don't indicate they're hovered

Based on data in the report, in the report scripts I am removing controls before the report runs and then attempting to add those controls back after the report is completed running.  I am doing this because the report requires the user to submit parameters and they can submit different parameters and run the report several times.  If I do not add the controls back after the report runs the first time, it will fail for all subsequent runs.
When doing this, I was under the impression that the first script that would ever run when running a report is the report_BeforePrint script and the last script that would ever run is the report_AfterPrint.  It appears, however, that my assumption may be incorrect.
Some of these controls exist in the group footer.  I have noticed that the group footer before_Print and after_Print scripts actually run several times throughout the execution of this report (which is only one page and only represents the group footer 1 time) and that they run after the report_AfterPrint script has run, which is problematic, because the controls are being added back before the final print of the group footer, which is causing my report to appear incorrectly.
Is this intended behavior?  If so, I am curious to know why because it doesn't logically seem to make sense, I would assume report_AfterPrint would mean after the report is done printing, i.e. the entire report and everything in it, and the fact that the group footer_Print scripts would execute so many times to print one footer also seems questionable.
If this is intended behavior, I would like to know if there are scripts that I can use in the way I intend that both 1)only execute 1 time per report generation and 2)one of which will execute before any other scripts in the report and one of which will execute after any other scripts in the report, each and every time, guaranteed.
Please let me know and let me know if you need further information.
Thank you,

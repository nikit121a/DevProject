Hi, 
we are using AccordionControl as menu item repository.
As you could see in attached screen shot, red circle is on all child element item.
"Tabelle Calendario" is a child of "Tabelle", it's clear because it has a 5 mm indent, "Application Audit Info" is child of "Visualizza" but it has not got indentation.
Could we indent child item in order to have facility in comprehension which is the group and which is the element item?
Thank you
Fabio

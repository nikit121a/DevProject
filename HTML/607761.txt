We've written a report for a client that has a couple of parameters used to control "column" visibility.  When they turn off a column, they want the remaining columns to shift or resize to consume the empty space left by the hidden column.
I've poked around looking for something to do this, and nothing has jumped out at me.  Is there a script or non-script way to handle this?
Attached is a screenshot for reference. Imagine the client elects to turn off the "% Of Total" column.  As a result, the client wants the Total and Cost/SQFT columns to shift to the right.

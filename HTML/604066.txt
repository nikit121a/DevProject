Hello, i have problems with memory leak. Can you please assist me address this issue.
I use SciTech .NET Memory Profiler, and get the following information:
 
The Form (frmLieferantenPlanung) and the XtraGrid.GridControl (DXBandedGrid) is disposed, but cant be collected from GC. The next item not disposed seems to be AdvBandedGridViewInfo..
I'm using inheritance and complex UserControl mechanics, so i cant simply create a test-application for you to reproduce this...
I found other issues of this type reported in your forum, and worked through the "solutions", but still cant address my issue.. I'm disposing my UserControls correctly etc.
Greetings
Yannik

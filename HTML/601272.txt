Hi Devexpress
We have a render problem with certain docx made with MS Office 2016.
I can open it with MS Office 2010 et MS Office 2016, but when i try to open it with any version ofÂ WPF component of the RichEdit (i even try with the demo of your last version 17.2.5) the render is not the same.
Please see the attachment and tell us if there is something to do with it ?
All the Best

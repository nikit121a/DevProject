Hi folks,
i'm trying to set the database version.
I read the support ticket (
  ) but it does not help me.
I change Module Project AssemblyInfo Version, however the Database Version is 0.0.0.0.
I need the version number to get the updates to work.
I attached a screenshot showing the Database Version 0.0.0.0 in the DatabaseVersionMismatch Event, while the AssemblyInfo Version is set to 1.0.0.1.
Your feedback would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Micha

Hi ,
Is there way to edit unbound coloumn in grid .
for example 
ColA  ColB  ColC
all of them becomes editable so i can change values in them by typing.
And each time when  value is changed in any coloumn formula of  colC=ColA * ColB needs to be implemented.
And Total Summary in bottom of page also needs to be updated.
How i do this?
Can you provide example to do it?

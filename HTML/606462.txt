Hi,
DxTagBox is not working as expected when using datasource and hideSelectedItems options.
In this demo: 
, if we set the hideSelectedItems to true:
And in onValueChanged(e), e.component._selectedItems always returns the last selected item instead of the whole selected items. If you remove hideSelectedItems options, it contains the correct array os selected items.
 Please advise on how to proceed or get the actual correct number of selected items, using theÂ hideSelectedItems option.
Thank you.

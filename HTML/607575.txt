I have a an issue which is related to the Values section of a PivotGrid inside a DashBoard. I am using DashBoard builder to create this dashboard.
Is it possible to disable the SUM functionality from the Value section ? (Image attached). I would like to have no function associated with this because as it is now the row values (red circle) do not coincide with the database values.
Can you help me with this issue ?
Thank youÂ

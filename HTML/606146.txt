Hi,
We are using the PrintableControlLink to print a pivotGrid.  (see code below)
This had been working without issue till recently - I'm guessing it was the update to 17.2.5 tht broke it.  
the error message is: All rectangle borders must have the same thickness.  In addition, any border can have a zero thickness, which means the border is invisible.
Could it be related to T595414? 
I need a quick fix for this as it is affecting production code. 
Regards
Habib

Hey folks,
i follow your 
 to build my own Designer (i need a SDI Interface).
 The inherited Form is not visible in VS2017 Designer. However i can start the WinForms application without anyproblem. To me it seems like a DesignerHost issue! I need to customize some buttons, so  it is necessary to work on the inherited Form in Visual Studio.
i uploaded a 
 to dropbox which shows the issue.
Thanks,
Micha

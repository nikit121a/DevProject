Hello! Help to understand Filter Control.
1. Operation IsBetween. How to work with Node.AdditionalOperands [1]?
2. Operation IsAnyOf.
Why is DataContext = null?
How to get ClauseNode? How do I process the result of a change?
OperandProperty v = Node.AdditionalOperands[1] as OperandProperty;
 v.PropertyName = _fieldName;
 
How to implement TwoElementsInSecondOperandTemplate?
Thank you!

Hi Mariya,
Thank you very much for your response. I can now loop through the individual documents. The example you provided exported to PDF, I have modified it to  just grab the HTML instead e.g. 
This gets the HTML but when sending the HTML as an email all seems fine except for images are not displayed. I can see in the HTML that the image is saved as base64 e.g.Â 
It appears that this is not compatible with Outlook 2007+. 
Do you have any suggestions to get around this? Are there any options with the RichEdit / RichEdit DocumentServer that can change the way this works?
I have seen a few posts that are very old asking for feature enhancements so I thought it would be best to ask first before pulling all my hair out!
Once again, thank you in advance, your help is appreciated.

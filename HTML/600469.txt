Hello   
I am seeing something I don't understand.   I have two forms that have a splitContainer on them - and I am seeing different property lists...  
Form 1 (created 10+ months ago)
  - Standard Xtra Form
  - Created under an older version of your controls (17.1?)
  - Older controls are un-installed
Form 2  (Created today)
  - Following your videos - this form base class is the RibbonForm
  - Created under 17.2.3 of your controls (what I currently have installed)
Note - I am in the process of redeveloping Form 1 - and will be moving everything over to Form 2 over the next few weeks.  Hence when you look at the images - the controls have the same names!! 
As you can see in the attached images in the Zip file - there are splitContainers on each form - with the same name.  However, when I select them and look at their properties - I do not see the same available properties.  Why would this be?  
Could it be that the splitContainer created in the older version of the components still has its same value?  This seems more than unlikely - and I don't think it is even possible?  Or could it be that I have some property set somewhere that is causing this?  
Do you have any thoughts as to what might be causing this?

Hi
It's difficult to get overviews in timeline views when there is a lot of "Appointments". Standard views are too "big" so you have to set on scrolling. This is however quite often not desirable.
Is there some kind of best practice for  setting sizes/zooming in/out both horizontally and vertically. 
I have made some scrolling on/off hours on/off and height calculated from count appointments that works, but it's rather primitive.
Another "issue" is multiple appointments on the same row - The row should grow in height in my opinion. 
several appointments on the same rows is displayed as thin lines.

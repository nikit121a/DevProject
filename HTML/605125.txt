Dear Support,
I have a form with a Search function and a treelist for results.  The search finds relevant data and performs a callback on the treelist to poulate the data.  This all works well EXCEPT the Treelist displays all data collapsed.  This is in spite of the fact that I have:
settings.SettingsBehavior.AutoExpandAllNodes = true;
I am sure this is not correct behaviour?
Regards
Les

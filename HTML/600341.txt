I have a grid with 
(datum), tk field and some other fields..
I want to group by datum (inclusive timepart !!) and tk inclusive some subtotals and grand total - see attchement)
As you can see with my code the result is not what I want  - de sequence is not correct. (I want per day the results of tk sort on time base)
 I guess the sorting is on TK (alphabetically) and that must be on datum (or id).
My code - VB.Net !!
        
So the correct display should be:
(first tk10 and then tk 1)
datum:25/01/2018

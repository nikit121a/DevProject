Hello. 
One of our user's most requestÂ using our software is that the first impression of a report take too much time to show (in preview dailog or direct print).
 We supposed that the report is compiled the first time we are printing a data linked to that report, and is cached for the next prints. 
Is there a way to pre load a list of most printed report (ticket report, bill report...) in another thread when user is connecting to his session in our application ? 
Do you have some optimisation advice to speed up the first report execution for a datatype when printed ? 
All our report are created using the Report V1 module. 
Thank you. 
Florent.

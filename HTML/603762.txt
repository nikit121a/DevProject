Hi,
Hi,
I have aÂ  WPF user control which simply put has this structure:
We use this view to show data in lots of different reports, based on the selected filter options.
Now I have a request for one report not to show it, but to just export data to csv.. Since I would like to reuse the following structure, I wonder if its possible to set DocumentPreviewControl's Source property to a text message like:
Successfully exported xxxx records to file.csv
I know I can use an empty report and place a message in center of it, but it would be less overkill if I can display just a message (like in DocumentPreview itself, or setting a UserControl as DocumentSource, or whatever).
This would also be useful to show some kind of initial message on empty document preview, like "press button to calculate data and show report".
Thanks,
Goran

HI team,
My project works on IE 11 compatibility mode and I'm using ASPxHtmlEditor version 10.1.6 which is not supported in compatibility mode of IE 11.
please find me a solution for working with this tool with IE 11 compatibility set to 'Edge'.
I used the following key in web.config file to set the compatibility, which I will not be able to remove
<httpProtocol>
      <customHeaders>
        <clear />
        <add name="X-UA-Compatible" value="IE=Edge" />
      </customHeaders>
    </httpProtocol>
Thanks,
Anandh G

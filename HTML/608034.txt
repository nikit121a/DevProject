Hello Sir,
I am looking for a simple feature to rename a treenodeitem (Devexpress.XPF.Grid.TreeListView). I am using "ShowEditor" property and "ShowEditorOnF2Key" to get the edit mode on the selected  treenodeitem.
I have setÂ 
but no luck.
Am i doing something wrong? My only requirement is to make tree node editable and rename it.
Thanks and Regards

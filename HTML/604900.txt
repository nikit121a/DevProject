Hi there,
I would like to use a stacked bar chart in my application.
You can see the current databaseoutput in the picture attached.
Now the Problem:
I want to create a stacked bar based on the VZA value, the organizationalUnits are the Siriesand theÂ ID is ArgumentField.
The OrganizationalUnits are totally random. In this Example its A,B,C, the next are 15 different integers, the next are 7 differnet alphanumerical and so on.
Im not sure how to create a stackedbar with these requirements. Any help would be appreciated.
Kind regards

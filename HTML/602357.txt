The Guest Names field requires a Facility and Facility Type to be selected.  
When Facility is selected, it populates the Facility Type.
But when Facility Type is selected, I expect for it to populate the Guest Names field but javascript errors are displaying.  
The one thing that is different from this WebService and the others, is that this one requires 2 parameters (Facility and Facility Type(Service)) instead of one.
Thanks

please provide a simple example (in a visual studio project) which the gridview is part of a form and user can choose one or more  entries in the grid.
Let say the gridview contains a list of persons with fields such as lastname, firstname, phone, fax (just a very simple list)  Let say each person has a column of checkbox and the user would check the checkbox to indicate the person is selected.  one or more persons can be selected.
when user submit the form in MVC, how to retriever the pe rsons along with other fields in the form in the controller.
Assuming the form is submit via a post. with html.antiforge token.
just to clarified each person is identified by a uniqueid field (hidden in the grid).   When the form posted, as long as the userid is retrieved as a list<int>
will be sufficient.

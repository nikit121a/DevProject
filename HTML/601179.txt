So this is related to some other tickets ive written but i think it need to be separate.
So i have a report, that has a sqlDataSource that gets its data from a stored procedure with 2 parameters.
Those 2 params of the stored procedure are mapped to 2 parameters of the report.
If i set Visible=true to the report params, and set them when trying to preview (at runtime), everything is ok.
I then create a report parameter object and assign it to the mentioned report. I set the report parameters to Visible=false.
When i click the report, i get the ui of the report param object, i set them, then click preview.
I want to set the values of the parameters  of the report with the values from the report parameter object.
So i have this link : 
It says here that i need to set the report parameters in the BeforePrint event, but the problem is that i get an error about populating the datasource, and it never reaches the BeforePrint event.
I tried to access the report parameter in the  DataSourceDemanded event, but the value of the report parameter object is not set yet.
So  theÂ DataSourceDemanded is to early to access the report parameter object, and BeforePrint is to late.
What can i do ? How can i set the report parameters before the report tries to execute the procedure (because that is what it seems its happening)

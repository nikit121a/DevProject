Dear support,
we have a grid with two boolean columns. When user checks checkboxedit in one column I will programatically uncheck the other  in CellValueChanging event handler.
But visually  it will only change when I leave the edited line. 
Is there any possibility to refresh form after change?
Many thanks in advance
Martin

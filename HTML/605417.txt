Hello Uriah,
I found the wanted labels, but something is wrong.
If I choose the 'Non Translated' filter, there is no hit at all.
If I choose the 'Your Translations' filter, it will only find one - but not the Hungarian translation.
If I choose 'All' filters, then several new lines will appear - but not the Hungarian translation.

I tried to correct the words in the downloaded source code but the build did not run due to the following error message:



---------------------------------------------------- 
The same is true for the other problematic texts in the docx file. 
Any idea how I can translate missing texts?

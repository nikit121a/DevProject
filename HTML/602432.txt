I am using ASPXFormLayout.
I've setup a tabbed section at the bottom of the page (TabbedLayoutGroup) 
On one of the tabs (<dx:LayoutGroup Caption="Photos"  VerticalAlign="Top" >) I have set up three items:
ASPxComboBox, ASPxImageGallery and ASPxUploadControl
When using the ASPxUploadControl I want ONLY the  ASPxComboBox and ASPxImageGallery to be refreshed - not the entire page.
I've put the contents of the tab in an update panel and a nested ASPXFormLayout but cant figure out how get the panel to update the list and images.
Once a file has been uploaded the code behind runs fine but the changes are not reflected in the list or gallery.
Hope this makes sense. Thank You.
ASPX code attached.

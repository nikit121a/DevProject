Hi Support,
I have implemented custom filtering based on an article I found in one of your tickets: 
The only problem is, in the filter editor it shows the ID of the item where it would be better for the end user to see the Name.
I have attached a screenshot also. 
Are you able to suggest how to get the filter to show the name instead of Id?
Thank you.

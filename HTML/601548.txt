Hi,
I am trying to arrange some dxbuttons in a view by using dxResponsiveBox. This works as long as I don't try to use event handlers.
But as soon as i use an event handler, it get an error claiming that the event handler is not defined.
This is my .dxview file:
This is my .js file:
If I take the button out of the ResponsiveBox, everything works.
 What am I doing wrong here?

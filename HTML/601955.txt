I'm trying to resize (larger) my controls (memo, textbox) in the Gridview PopupEditForm, I searched your database but it seems that in my case all the solutions are not working.
what did I try:
- popup width 1000px and controls 100% or *px
- used a aspxmemo control in EditItemTemplate
It is working with aspxlabel control
Attached, screenshot and code Gridview

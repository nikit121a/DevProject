I have a seenario where we are creating an Accordion Control, adding Elements and each element has an AccordionContentContainer.  In this container is a user control that has a grid in it.  We would like to see if there is a way to implement mouse dragging to expand the height of the AccordionContentContainer.  Currently we have an option where the user chooses how many rows they want to see and we calculate the height and set programmatically.  Our users would prefer to use the mouse.  Is this possible?

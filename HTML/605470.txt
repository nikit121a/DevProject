When doing a search in the FindPanel via the Enter key,
FindPanel applies the filter an then sends VK_RETURN to the underlying control.
Is this behaviour by design? Other action keys are set to 0 afterwards.
Why not:
Now FindPanel "disturbs" the key handling in the underlying form.
In the underlying form i would like to do something like this
How can i detect whether FindPanel has sent VK_RETURN?

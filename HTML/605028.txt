We'd like to go from our Addict Spell Checker control to your spell checker library, but there is a very important feature which you do not seem to have based on 5 year old tickets...namely the ability to see a misspelled word even when the editor containing the misspelling is not in focus. A TO-DO ticket for this feature was created a decade ago, but there is no information on it. Will this ever be in the radar for DevExpress as far as implementing it? Or are there too few users taking advantage of the feature to care about it? Please let me know so I can decide what direction to take on this.

Hello,
we are using DataLayoutControl to display our data annotations to generate our form layouts. It works perfect for textfields, combomboxes aso. but the text of the checkbox does not display the datamember it shows up as CheckEdit1, at first i thought its because boolean value, but if i use CheckedComboBoxEdit the issuse don't show up. So its more problem of the version and the CheckBox Method from DevExpress, because a lot of the same problem in the Tickets. If you recommend i can upload an example.
Thanks

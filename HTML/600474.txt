Hello there,
My goal is to add a view to the document manager (generated by the scaffolding wizard) on startup. 
As far as I can tell, I need to  create a module first. THEN add it to the document viewer.  These modules are restricted to being Collection Entity Objects (as generated by the scaffolding wizard). Please correct me if I am wrong about this? The view I want to add has a viewmodel which is not a collection.
 I gather I should be using this method below, but I seem to be a bit daft in terms of figuring out how it works...
If anyone has any help on how to do that, I'd be super grateful
Thank you 
John

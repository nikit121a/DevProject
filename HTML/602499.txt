Hi DevExpress Support,
      I just want to ask for help about a certain use case where I have a view model called "CreateUserViewModel" as shown below.
that is bound to a devextreme form, but I have a property of that view model which is a collection of a certain type, "CategoryViewModel" and "CategoryViewModel"  acts as a parent node in a heirarchy as shown below.
Its child nodes which are of the "RoleViewModel" type have a property called "Selected" which is either true or false as shown below.
The goal is to push the updates to the "Selected" property of the RoleViewModel type when the form is submitted.
 My initial plan was to use a separate control from a devextreme from which is a devextreme tree view, since the view model is being passed into the view, I'm expecting that whenever I made changes to that "Selected" property of RoleViewModel by checking or unchecking child nodes in the tree view, I would be able to still capture it when I submit the form, but turns out, I'm only passing the property values that are bound inside of a devextreme form even though both the devextreme form and devextreme tree view are inside of a form tag, 
     Here is the view code which details my initial plan
Just want your suggestion on what is the most effective approach to this ? 
Thanks!
Jude Alquiza.

When creating a dialog though the ModuleManager,  the first time the created viewmodel is used, creating the dialog for the second time doen't use the new viewmodel, it reuse the previous viewmodel.
How is it possible to show the dialog with a new viewmodel?
Edit: I think it comes down to this: How to pass a parameter to the MIF Module ViewModelFactory method?
For example, if the Dialog button has a parameter, how can this value be passed to the viewmodel?

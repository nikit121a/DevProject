Hi.
We're using DashboardViewerExtension in our analytics portal. There's quite an amount of custom stuff there, UI for selection of dashboards, XML in database, filtering queries on certain dashboards etc. 
Now since DashboardViewer is now obsolete, I'm trying to replace it with DashboardExtension and I'd like to know what's the best approach.
- we want to let the user pick a dashboard using our custom controls
- we sometimes need to modify queries on the run
- our users are able to save (most) filters using our custom functions, but if there was an embedded UI for saving filters in localstorage, we'd probably use it 
I've seen most of the walthroughs and answers available on this topic and I just need to make sure I'm not missing anything. 
I'll start with this question:
Is it possible to bind the DashboardLoading and similar events using DashboardExtension in Razor, when I cannot pass DashboardSourceModel anymore? How? Or what alternatives are there, when we want to keep handling stuff?
Thanks for any answers/pointers.

When I set a item visible true or false it scrolls to the top of the page.
I reproduce the error in the following plunker:
You need to openÂ the  preview in the windowed mode like the attached file. Then click on "Show the Phone" checkbox, then it will scroll to the top.
Other similar error:
The "scroll to top" also happens on the Tab Panel
Open it on the preview in the windowed mode then scroll to the botton, then click on the last visible "More space", it will scroll to the top as well.
Thank you
Diogo

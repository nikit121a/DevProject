Hi Team!
I am migrating a solution with multiple projects dependent on DevExpress libraries to use DevExpress nuget repository.
It is quite confusing for me that the package names do not really match the dll libraries names (e.g. DevExpress.Xpf.*.dll are in Â DevExpress.Wpf.* packages) and some packages contain multiple dlls, which makes it hard to find out which package you need to install in order to get a particular dll.
Given that I thought it would be very useful to have a list of available nuget packages mapped to the libraries they contain so that one could reference it and automate the migration process.
Could you please provide me with this information?
Thanks!
P.S. I have seen this article 
 and it is not actually supplying such detailed info as I'm looking for.

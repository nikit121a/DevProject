Hello,
I created a form with a tilecontrol. Within the tilecontrol I show directories on a hard disk orderd by a-z. On theÂ  form I also have buttons with the characters a-z. I want to jump to the first tileitem with started with "d" when I presse the "D" button.
Is there a method availale which allows me to jump to the first "d" tileitem or do I need to go thru all tileitems and check whether it starts with "d" and select it manually ?
I attached a screenshot how the form looks like.
Thanks and regards
Uwe

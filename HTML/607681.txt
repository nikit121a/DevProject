Hi,
I'm trying to use the localization features of DevExtreme, but I can't make it work.
There are 2 problems:
a) loading messages 'fr' does not work. When I right-click on the datagrid headers, I still see the English texts.
b) the number editor isn't formatting it's value using the current locale (with a komma as a decimal separator)
I've added a testproject in attachment.
Note: to be able to import the 'fr' messages as a module, I've had to modify the typings.ts file .

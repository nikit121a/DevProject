I am using a LookupEdit in my grid view. I am using the GridViewCustomRowCellEditForEditing event to assign the correct repository editor at runtime.
When I set the language culture to Arabic for the application the items in the list and editor are shown incorrectly. I have two strings in the datasource that is assigned to the editor.
 
3840 x 2160 
1920 x 1080 
 
When displayed in Arabic culture these strings are shown as
 
x 2160 3840 
X 1080 1920 
 
Any reason to why this is happening?Â

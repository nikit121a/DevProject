Hi,
I'm programming app with XAF (Web & Windows) and created two different XPO-Classes. One class derived from built-in person XPO and the 2nd is an own class for representing a list of all german ZIP-codes and towns.
Now I want to assgin every object of my person class 1 to x entries of my prefilled ZIP-Code-class. For that I would like invoke an dialog, which represents all entries of ZIP-Code-Class in a list-view or tree view, so that the user can select one or more rows, that will added to the person class.
It should not be possible to create own entries in ZIP-Code-Class, the zip-codes are only a datasource for the invoked dialog to select and add.
The goal is, to assign towns and regions, the person is responsible for. e.g. a sales representative is responsible for Los Angeles, Chicago and Detroit. Another sales representative is responsible for Washington, Chicago and New York.
How can I achieve this? Do you have any example (code) or tutorial for that?
Thx for supporting me.
regards
Michael

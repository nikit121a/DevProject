Hello.
I  use 'DateEdit' element in my code.
The value is supposed to into the related database.
But It has Datetime2 type  and when it entered into the database, It caused an Error.
It shows 'System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: The conversion of a datetime2 data type to a datetime data type resulted in an out-of-range value. 
How can I this DateEdit Value start s from 1753.01.01 and How can I set this DateTime2 type in code as DateTime
so I can put this DateTime2 type into DateTime type column in my database?
 Thank you.

In my template I have a dxForm with this field:
I am having an issue where if the user inputs an illegal value that is outside the min/max range, such as 5 for example, and then without pressing the Enter key or removing focus from the number box control goes straight to clicking the form submit button then the value is instantly changed to fit inside the range (5 becomes 3, for example) then the form is submitted.
This is a problem because the user won't know that the value they enter has been changed before they submit the form. I want it instead to keep the illegal value of 5 and display a validation error on the field.

Our PostgreSQL database has 10s of thousands of functions defined. When trying to edit queries through the query editor (both in the visual 
studios designer and the web report designer), we experience an OutOfMemoryException error when loading these functions. Is there anyway around this? Is there a way to edit the query used to populate the stored procedures in the editor so that we can filter out the functions/stored procedures we don't want returned?
Thanks,

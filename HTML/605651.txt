I have a simple class that I'm using to hold TreeList data:
The KeyFieldName is NodeId.
If I load data into the tree with the first item having a NodeId of zero, when I try to drag data from another tree to the first item, it improperly makes that data the root node. I'm attaching an image to show the problem.
In that image, notice that the "Pid" of the new item added is "0" and should have shown up as a child of the item with a description of "1".
The issue only appears when adding items after the tree is initially populated, and only if the initial NodeId is 0. I tried non-zero values such as "1" and "100" and both worked correctly.
Thanks.

Hello,
I use a custom property editor(ASPxCombobox) which is inherited from ASPxObjectPropertyEditorBase, I've implemented a custom filtering for this editor by using ItemsRequestedByFilterCondition and ItemRequestedByValue events.
Filtering does not work correctly when searching with some Turkish characters, these characters are '?' and '?'.
For example if I have this following objects
- TEST KL??E
If i type 'test kli?e', i should find this item. 'i' is the lowercase and '?' is the uppercase in Turkish.
Same for '?' letter
- TEST FIRM
I should find this item if i type 'test f?rm'.    
If you need to debug and see this issue, I've attached a small sample project. You can search these 2 objects(MT_Firm objects) above in MT_Proposals. 
I've found a ticket(T566399) which is similar to this issue and tried this solution in my case but it didn't work.
Can you suggest a solution for this issue please ?
Regards.

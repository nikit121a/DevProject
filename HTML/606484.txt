Hello,
I am creating a chart with the daily sales evolution of a product category, and you are asking me to submit a full year.
There are two problems (see the image in the attachment):
1. as to the density of vertical lines
2. Stacking the labels at the bottom of the graph.
My question is, how can I make so that even by displaying the 365 values of the year, both the rows and the labels are displayed only one for each month?
Thanks.

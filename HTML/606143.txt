Hi support...
Is it possible to apply DelayedAttribute at runtime?
I have a following Persitent class
Next I apply attributes at runtime
When I try to query the data from database:
I get an error:
"Property '<null>' does not exist within type 'DAX.QWorkshop.Domain.Model.Entities.Order'."} DevExpress.Xpo.Exceptions.PropertyMissingException
If I change 
to
I get another error
"Property 'DAX.QWorkshop.Domain.Model.Entities.SalesOrder.Notes' does not contain an XPDelayedProperty object."
Any help appreciated :).
Best

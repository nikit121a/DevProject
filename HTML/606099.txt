I created a dashboard that uses and Excel Data Source and saved the Dashboard as an xml file. Then i created a Winforms app and loaded the xml file in a Dashboard viewer. Each week we want to select a new spreadsheet with the same schema that has new data. I've been struggling for more than a week trying to get the dashboard to refresh with a new data source. The Dashboard viewer always shows data associated with the original Excel file.
I've tried using event handlers like LoadingData, tried the refresh() method, changing data sources after the following code snippet:
 
                var dashboard2 = new Dashboard();
                DashboardViewer dashboardViewer2 = new DashboardViewer();
                dashboardViewer2.Dashboard = dashboard2;
                dashboardViewer2.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
                tabControl1.TabPages["tabPage2"].Controls.Add(dashboardViewer2);
                dashboardViewer2.LoadDashboard(@"C:\Metrics\Prototype2.xml");
                DashboardExcelDataSource excelDataSource = new DashboardExcelDataSource("NewExcelData");
                excelDataSource.FileName = openFileDialog1.FileName;
                ExcelWorksheetSettings worksheetSettings = new ExcelWorksheetSettings("DocQuery");
                excelDataSource.SourceOptions = new ExcelSourceOptions(worksheetSettings);
                excelDataSource.Fill();

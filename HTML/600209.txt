Hello,
we use the Xpf Grid with a custom Theme in our product. We only use a TableView.
Is it possible to strip down the components in the Theme Editor? The current theme  contains all kinds of components which we do not use and whose themes are thus never accessed.
The theme sources are > 100MB currently and the theme assembly is > 7 MB. Is there a safe way to remove the unused components from the Theme project to reduce the sizes? 
Regards,
Janis

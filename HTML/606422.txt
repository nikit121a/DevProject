I've run into an issue with using the bootstrapgridview within an bootstrap-accordion (not the dx accordion).  
The gridview has the AdaptivityMode set to "HideDataCells" and AllowOnlyOneAdaptiveDetailExpanded to "true".  What I have observed is that when the gridview is on the orginial tab set to be open ("show") on page load, the gridview will scale accordingly.  But if the gridview is on a tab that is closed ("collapse"), when this tab is opened the gridview has not scaled to the appropriate viewport size.  This leaves the gridview scaling off the screen. Now, once the browser window is resized or a next page button is pressed it scales correctly.  See attached image.

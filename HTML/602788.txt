Hi,
I have several XtraReports in my project. 
They do not have  any complex code,. they all look like the following sample:
When I compile them, I get warnings, as the following one, about virtual methods being executed, but I cannot find the cause of this proble:
The report is shown correctly when the program is executed, but this warning message is always shown during compilation. Is this something I should care or should I just ignore it?
 Could you please help me find what is going on here?
Thanks for your support.

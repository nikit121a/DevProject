Our customers use the Next Page button to jump the top of the next page to the top of the viewer.
They want to be able to use the keyboard shortcut advertised by the ribbon, but unfortunately the viewer seems to handle the keystroke and prevent the button from taking effect.
Rather than triggering the Next Page functionality, PgDn currently controls the viewer scrollbar which has a very different effect than what our customers want. For almost any zoom level it does not start put the top of the next page at the top of the viewer.
This issue exists in both the ReportPrintTool and the customizable ribbon preview form.

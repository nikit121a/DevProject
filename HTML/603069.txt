Hello,
I have two DateTime in a split pane.
The  DateTime is closed from the right border. The drop down right side isn't displayed. 
Is it possible to shift the drop down to the left ?
If the width of the pane is reduced. The drop down is truncated both side.
Is it possible to display completely the drop down?

When I new up the DocumentPreviewWindow class, the background color for the buttons in my application are changing.  
      DocumentPreviewWindow previewWindow = new DocumentPreviewWindow()
      {
        Owner = Application.Current.MainWindow
      };
Something in that code is overriding global settings.  How can I either fix that or work around it?
Before and after screenshots attached.

Hello,
I'm reading an excel file with this lines of code:
This works in my development machine, but on the target machine where the program has to run, it works only if I compile AnyCpu or x86, while I need x64.
The machine configuration:
- Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard 64 bit
- No Office installed
- .NET 4.5.2
Any advice?
Thakns

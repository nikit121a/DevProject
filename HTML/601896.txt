Hey,
Just wondering if someone could help us with a small issue.
We are using Dev Express on our custom user control(winforms).
We have a Accordion Control and are using  AccordionContextButton for some text buttons for users to do some actions.
Just wondering if it was possible to change the on hover event to change the users mouse cursor to the hand icon, to indicate it's a button?
I've had a look over the API and I can't seem to find a method to do this.
Thanks!

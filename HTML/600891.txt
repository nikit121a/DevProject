Hi Devexpress team !
I use this example to export to excel (
"> 
)
But each row of the pivot grid has to be in a different page to be printed.
Currently it just exports the grid just as the example and when I want to print it, it just displays the data continuously; 
I attached an image to let you know the idea of what I want to do. ghh

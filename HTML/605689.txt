Hi, I'm trying to make a complex query within the query builder for the dashboard module since I can not find another way to enter a query.
Actually I have a static function in one of my classes that returns a CriteriaOperator based on the parameters passed, to be able to use this would be great, but I'll settle with reproducing the query in the dashboards module.
The part I'm having trouble reproducing is:




To be more specific the join with the class ChangeInStatus because I need to find if within that class I have a record for the parent within the dates I'm looking, but it seems I can not make this kind of query with the query  builder.
Please advise.

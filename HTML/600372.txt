Hi,
I am using Binary image as an editor and a column editor.
Column editor works fine (upload, bind, preview).
Stand alone editor uploads fine, shows the picture and the form sends the picture to database and it is saved.
But when I open the saved record, the picture is shown only if I remove the edit capabilities of the control.
Is this by design?
This is my code:
Thank you.

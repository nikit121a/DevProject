Hi,
the "ASPxFileManager" has trouble handling folders that contain the " / " character in the name. 
On attached an example image.
I tried to remove this character and it seems to work correctly.
The control is managed through a "customFileSystemProvider"  with the option EnableCallBacks enable.
 How can I remove the problem?

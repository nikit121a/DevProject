hi!
we re using some richeditcontrols bound to the same windows forms binding source.
the problem occurs if we try to add text to more than one richedit at once.
we are using 
and usedeferreddatabindingnotifications is set to false
if we dont use: databindings[0].WriteValue() then the inserted text gets lost if we try to save.
the richeditcontrols are in tabcontrols and layoutcontrols etc.
any suggestions?

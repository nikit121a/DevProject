Hi,
I have created a WPF project using scaffolding wizard and selected "Hybrid UI View". I am using "17.2.5" version of DevExpress.
My ADO.NET Entity model is connected to northwind database which has a "Categories" table..This table has a field "Picture" whose datatype is "image".  
Scaffolding wizard has created view and View Model for "Categories" table. When I run the project and add a new record with picture, the record get saved in database table. However value of "picture" field is NULL. While adding record when I select image I can see its preview on screen but not sure why the picture is not saved in database.Â 
I am attaching source code of my project also copying database "Northwind2010" in root folder.  
Could you please fix the issue and share the updated source code as soon as possible?
Thanks

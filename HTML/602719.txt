Hello,
Within the new version of Devexpress 17.2.5 we have experienced a  doted lines on the produced preview (See screenshot).
While in 17.1.0 it was not visible.  Furthermore a user is able to change a margin.
HowÂ to remove those doted line and prevent user to modify a content of the document? 
Cheers
Ioseb

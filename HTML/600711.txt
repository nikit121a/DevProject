On another related note, 
  This is very confusing to the user (i.e., no indication at all that the grid is actually performing an action that the user should wait for) and very non-standard.  Is there someway to have the loading panel display a gray, transparent overlay on top of the grid to disallow interaction with the grid while the data source is doing its job?

Hi,
Our PivotGrid control uses   Async Mode (AssociatedObject.SetDataSourceAsync(AsyncDataSource, OnDataChangedCompleted);) .  Data source is a DataTable.
we set datasoure and fields are created using attached behavior.  We have bound and unbound fields.
A jing screencast of the application is attached.
 When the report is loaded, the control displays unbound fields as "error"
once we invoke the expression editor on any unbound field (in this example all three test fields are unbound)
all unbound fields are re-evaluated and display corrects itself.
In debugging we see an exception  that is probably the cause of it.  Relevant call stack and exception details are attached as well.
Could you help us

Hello, DevExpress support,
Please advice me how to adjust spacing between ribbon's PageHeaders items.
I need to place two controls onto ribbon's Page Header. 
These two controls should appear with very small distance between them.
Default distance is too big.
As I can see that distance comes from some BarEditItem's padding around contained edit.
Screenshot and sample project are in attached archive.
Dmitry.

Hi,
I have a problem with deserializing the layout of my GridControl. As you could see in the project attached I have a custom grid summary item for my gridcontrol, I did that because I need the Tag property of my summary item after deserializing the layout, so I've created a custom summary item and added a SerializableTag property to it. The problem is that when I serialize the layout in one language and then deserialize it when my app's language is set to another, all the controls get their headers/names/contents and etc in the correct language except my summary item's contents. As you can see in the attached example I serialized the layout in English and then changed it to Russian and tried to deserialize it but I'm still receiving English summary items. What can I do to fix this issue?
Thanks in advanceÂ

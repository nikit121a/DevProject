Hello,
Since the update to version 17.2.5 we observed the following behavior in the spreadsheet:
A simple click on a cell change the value of the Modified property to true and enable the save button of the ribbon even if no proper modification has been done.
The behavior has been observed in both our own project and the different examples you provide.
Do you plan to go back to the previous behaviour, which, we think, was more logical ?
If no, is there a way to handle the Modified  property ourselves and retablish the previous behaviour in our project ?

I am using a Behavior<FrameworkElement> based on 
 to implement custom drag-n-drop behaviour. I would like to disable starting a drag operationÂ when the user accidentally starts the drag from the searchpanel.
i do the following for disable drag from the scrollbar:




When this returns true i stop the drag operation. How do i test for the search box?

Hi,
I'm using the TcxColorComboBox to display several colors in the drop down menu.
The TcxColorComboBox is made of two parts, the box filled with the color and its name. This is my situation:
[ YELLOW ]   clYellow                                     (starting color)
[ BLACK ]   clBlack
[ YELLOW  ]   clYellow
[ RED ]   clRed
[ LIME ]   clLime
[ COLOR] By Layer <--------------------------- I need the color box of this row   to be filled with BLACK, YELLOW, RED or LIME named as By Layer.
In this way, I can have two rows with the same color box but with different names.
Apparently, the TcxColorComboBox doesn't allow me to display the same color more time in the drop down.
Is it possible to achieve this?
Cordially,
Gianluigi

hi,
i would liek your opinion on what kind of best practice you recomend when using your controls for a big, CRM/ERP type application winforms, that i wish to have as less as usniqe and repeated work as possible.
for example, i was imagening if i create a devexress usercontrol, and put there 1 ribbon control (blank), and one xtratabe control with 2 tabs (list) and (details), then put a blank xtraGrid in the List tab, and nothing more....
someohow i would then use that when i make new winforms, and jst drag and drop it in my form, and have the basic UI the same and ready to use.
but even thought the modifier is set to public, that usercontrol into my form is useless in the designer! i cant interact with any of the controls that are inside to add custom code and my functions. ure i could all do that from code but is a lot of work to do soemthing the visual designer can do in seconds and i can SEE what i am building without runnin it all the time!
i cant click the ribon to add new buttons, i cant switch the tab to add new controls in the details for example etc.
i know its pobably a noob question but it just never happented to need that before and i wnt to do more inherit and not copy psting the same ui again and again and have to maintane the same code in various locations.
i am now trying to use your winforms mvvm poco framework...but maybe i am just doing or thinking this all wrong, so i decided to just ask the experts.
thanks for your time i really hope for a reply.
regards
John

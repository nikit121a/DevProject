Hi,
after upgrading to the last version i have the following error message when i try to 'Update model on all projects'
Error:
Cannot find a descendant of the XafApplication class to detect settings of your application in the following folder(s):
D:\RMA\RMA\RMA.Win\bin\Debug\
For a Windows Forms application, this folder(s) must contain your application executable file.
For an ASP.NET application, this folder(s) must contain the assembly containing your WebApplication descendant.
Update failed
i can run the application without any issue
how i can resolve this?

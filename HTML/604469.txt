I'm trying to override the 
styles, I tried to find the 
using 
 but no luck. 
It's weird  that when pressing shift and clicking on what I want to change, the Theme editor does not show anything, and does not show the ControlTemplate. as you can see from the attached image.
I have done something similar for the docking control  and it worked fine with theme editor.
I took a screen shot which shows how I need the TabControl to look like. please check the attached image.

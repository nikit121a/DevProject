Hello,
I was wondering, is it expected behaviour that an editable gridview  (OptionsBehavior.Editable = true)  doesn't allow its items to be dragged? 
I have a few non-editable columns (OptionsColumn.AllowEdit = false), that I thought should be suitable for dragging using the BehaviorManager component (as in 
).
How do I do this?

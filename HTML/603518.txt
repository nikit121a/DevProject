Hello.
I have checked several topics, but don't found any regarding object permissions merging.
My steps to reproduce:
- I have Administrators and Default default roles. 
- Default role has read rights for own user only (defined with OBjectPerimission with criteria). 
- if I add both roles to a user, then I can't see another user, although I have no RolesMergingMode.GrantedInAllRoles because I am on 17.2.4 yet.
In other words I have access for all users in Administrators role, but Default role is denied it by ObjectPermissions.
 
So looks like it works only fot type permissions, althought it is looks logically for me: if I have one role with granted access to an object and another one role denied it, then for RolesMergingMode.GrantedInAnyRole I should have Allow access, instead of deny (like it done for types permissions).

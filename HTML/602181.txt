If you have a Report with a datasource that uses the "DisplayName" attribute, it can make the the new expression binding lookup go wrong.
For Example our datasource is something like:
public class SomeDatasource
{ 
    [DisplayName("Report Data")
    public ReportData ReportData {get; set;}
} 
If you try to drag on the field in the designer from the Field List it will work ([ReportData].[SomeField]).  But if you hit the smart tag of a label and try to set it to an expression it will be set wrong and not work ([Report Data].[SomeField]). Same happens if you use the Expression Editor.

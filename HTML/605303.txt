I am using repx files for developing reports for our customers.
As I do in Visual Studio on changing source code I would like to compare my changes made in the reports before I send  them to the customers.
 
As you can see in attached screenshot my versioning System (Microsoft Visual SourceSafe)  does not Show any source Code to compare differences.
It shows many changes although I opened and saved file without making any changes. 
Do you provide any possibility to save reports  with readable source Code?

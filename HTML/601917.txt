Hi DevExpress Support,
I understand from documentation & from my previous discussions with DevExpress technical support, 
 event is used to for cell level customization. I followed this approach and I have few queries regarding the performance.
Above code is fairly simple (I have even more complex usage in my project), in this piece of code I'm just setting 
 on Cells based on defined criteria. Obviously you might notice that I'm creating many 
 objects (Font is immutable), this leads error 
(Screenshots attached) . I even used perfmon to monitor number of objects sitting around and the number getting promoted to higher Generations, trust me it is pretty high.   
Based on above I have following questions -
1. Are there any way to avoid creating 
 objects?
2. Is there anyway we can safely dispose these objects (Any API call)?   
3. I have also noticed a performance degradation when subscribing to "
" event (Screenshot Attached).
I really appreciate any quickest help on these queries.
Thanks,
Hari Prasad

Hi Paul,
This might be an additional ticket, but I noticed that the methods above didn't resolve the issue with scaling when there is no data present in the datagrid ("empty data row").Â  I did test against the project you sent back and the gridview column headers do not appear to adjust.
Thanks,
Troy

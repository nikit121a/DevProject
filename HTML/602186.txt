Hi
When trying to touch a data visualization control to view the given tooltip, or using dxPivotGridFieldChooser to drag-n-drop fields for binding data to a dxPivotGrid, none of the touch events gets fired.
This is true for all Android devices  running Firefox (tested in newest version 58).
But, this does work as expected on IOS devices and  desktop version of Firefox (also version 58).

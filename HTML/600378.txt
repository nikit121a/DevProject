I am trying to fill some fields with predefined values, a user clicks on add new row.
My problem is that I am able to do that when the fields are visible, but my code has no effect when the fields are not visible. 
My code is 
        protected void grdxTimings_InitNewRow(object sender, DevExpress.Web.Data.ASPxDataInitNewRowEventArgs e)
        {
            e.NewValues["id"] = id;
            e.NewValues["FieldCategory"] = "TimeSchedule";
        }
 
Can you help please ?

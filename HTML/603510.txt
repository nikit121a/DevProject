I am using a DevExpress.XtraBars.Docking.DockManager. When the user exits the application, I  use the function SaveToStream() to store the current layout the user has created, and when he logs in again, I use RestoreLayoutFromStream() to load his last layout again. Most of the time, this is working fine. But however, sometimes it seems that the data I have stored before and give as a parameter to the RestoreLayoutFromStream() method is damaged and the restore method leads to a layout where all dockable panels are closed.
Is there any possibility how I can get an info that the  RestoreLayoutFromStream() method failed? Cause the method has return type void and it does not throw any exception when the data stored at the stream can not be processed. Would be very helpful to identify this situation, I would then be able to restore a default layout and maybe give a message to the user.

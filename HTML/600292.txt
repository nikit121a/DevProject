I am generating a report in my WPF application.  The user has the choice to print the report directly out fo the DocumentPreviewControl or export to PDF/etc and print from that.  
The report is a landscape formatted report.  In the report designer, I set the left/right margins to 0.25, and the top/bottom to 0.15 since there is a lot of data in this report. 
If the user exports to PDF and prints the report from the PDF, it prints fine.
If the user prints directly from the documentPreviewControl, the printout seems to "zoom" and the top/bottom of the report gets cut off slightly.
Why would printing from the DocumentPreviewControl do any scaling?

When pressing CTRL+SHIFT+Q and the jump to window opens, I find it hard sometimes to find the method I need because I also have unit tests that start with the same name of the function I am looking for. Please show a different icon for methods and for unit tests so I can distinguish between them faster than scanning the entire list of methods starting with the same name to find the actual method and not the unit tests testing it

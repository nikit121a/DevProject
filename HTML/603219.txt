Hi,Â 
I attached a video to demonstrate this and also a sample application.
I seems that it does not happen all the time, but you can see in the video how applying Sugiyama algorithm does not correct the connector type. But if I drag a little bit the node connected by the wrong typed connector, the layout updates automatically and connector type is corrected. After this step, if I click again on "Apply Sugiyama" button, the mentioned connector does not get wrong anymore.
Please take a look.
Best regards,
Alin

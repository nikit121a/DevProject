Hi,
When I copy this exactly: 
I get these errors in SplashScreen1.cs:
   The name 'InitializeComponent' does not exist in the current context  
   The name 'progressBarControl1' does not exist in the current context   
What is wrong please? Do I need to add references to my project?
Kind regards,
Alex

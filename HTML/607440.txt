I have a FilterControl with the SourceControl set to a GridControl.
The user has the option to rename the column caption at run-time, However, the changes do not get reflected in the FilterControl. 
I have put together a sample application, where you can rename grid columns, and it will not reflect in the FilterControl. 
Please let me know if there's any way to trigger the FilterControl to update the column captions. 
Thanks!

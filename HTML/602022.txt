We are using your XtraCharts component in conjunction with the data grid component and use the data grid component's export function.
In that database there is a field which represents the time of day in seconds. 
This field is interpreted in the component, so the displayed value has a human readable format (hh:mm:ss). 
Is it possible to use this format when exporting the data via the export function provided by your component?
My guess is we'd have to use either 
 or  
but I have not yet figured out how to do it.

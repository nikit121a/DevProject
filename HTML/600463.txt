Our XML dashboard files are stored in a table and we have both a window and webform dashboard viewer to display the same xml... We recently made a change to a dashboard that caused the web version to render incorrectly when compared to the windows version... 
Please see attached video (Left is window (Good), Right is Web (Wrong))
Notice the TreeMap slices when used to filter, they change size on the web version, why? on window version they do not which is the correct behavior
BTW: the change we made was to disable "ignore master filter" on the combo-box, if we re-enable that, they they both behave the same ...Again this is the same XML being accessed by both viewer
size of the treemap slices should not be changing when used to filter data...
Please help

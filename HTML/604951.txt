Hi there,
Â i have a problem with the Bootstrap Accordion. I want to create multiple accordions with some charts inside. To reduce the initial loading time, i want to load them only on opening the accordion.
But i cant find a way to get this working.
Below is the code i use and a video is attached.
Thank you in advance

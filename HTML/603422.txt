In some cases, It doesn't work. 
I've implemented SingleChoiseAction which contains  just one ChoiceActionItem in some cases (I fill it dynamically).
In these cases, dropdown icon is hidden and SingleChoiceAction.ShowItemsOnClick property is ignored. Therefore, users are confused because they see only action with default caption (instead enum value caption).
 The issue just related to XAF Web. In win version I never had that problem (see attach).
Could you suggest any workaround  for Web UI bug? (17.2.4 version)

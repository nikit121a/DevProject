Good afternoon,
I have an XtraTabControl and sometimes I need to enable / disable it. Tab control has multiple pages, each page may have other tab controls inside it . Each child tab control has one or multiple pages with scroll control and layout control in it. Every time when I am set Enable = true or false, it takes long time to refresh the screen. SuspendLayout, BeginUpdate doesn't work it seems.
Regards,

Hi,
Is it possible to change the "Connection Name" for a SqlDatasource in the Report Designer? (see screenshot below)
I was used to acess and change this value direct in the .repx file with version 16.2.3:
            // 
            // sqlDataSource
            // 
            this.sqlDataSource.ConnectionName = "DataPlaygroundCustomConnection";
but now, as of 17.2.4, it seems that this value is encrypted within the .repx and I'd like to change this values from the designer.
Thanks in advance,

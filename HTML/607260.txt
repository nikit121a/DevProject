Hello XAF Team,
I have a problem about XAF ASP.Net Project, 
I have aggregated Master Detail object relation. Activated Nested ListView Inline Edit  mode.
When I open a new Master record ( called DemandDocument ) filling some dummy data to master. After that adding a new detail record ( called DemandItem ) to this Master object. 
Clicking Master's Save action,  committing this 2 object ( I observed from a controller ObjectSpace_Committing event ) successfully completed.
But inline update action still exists, so when leaving to another NavigationItem, browser pop's up Unsaved Confirmation Dialog box.
You can see from attached images. 
My question is that, 
How to execute this nested listview's inline update command action when I click Master Object's Save action.
I tried GridView's UpdateEdit method in Committing -> not worked. ( Visually worked but browser asked again )
I tried to Suppress unsaved confirmation -> not worked  ( 
 )

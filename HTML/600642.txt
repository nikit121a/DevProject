Hello,
please find attached a project to reproduce the issue I'm having. In some cases in my application I have to transpose the columns and rows of a worksheet in the SpreadsheetControl and other kind of actions, that involve hiding or showing worksheet columns or rows and modify the columns width or row heights.
If I have comments within the cells involved, I realize that the comments height (even width in some cases) are changed when I play with the columns width, rows height, copy range to other parts of the worksheet, etc.
In the attached example (I show the transpose action), if you click several times in the top-left button, you can see how the comment height grow, where I supose to have it static in the same size.
I need to maintain the comment size fixed, because is wrong to see this comment resized with these kind of actions.
Is there something I'm doing wrong?
Thanks in advance!

Hello. 
How can i get Html string from richedit control? 
Control has only two methods for getting text. GetText and GetRtfText, but i need Html string. 
I read in topic below that for working with html i need to include
dxRichEdit.Html to my project
I tried to do it for c++:
#include "dxRichEdit.Html.hpp"
but i have a linker error. Screenshot of error in attachment

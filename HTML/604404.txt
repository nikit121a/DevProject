Hi,
i have a grid with a column with a special celltemplate.
The celltemplate is build in the oncellprepared event.
...
....
The column is now displayed in special color and a text replacement of the original number value in the column.
If i now make a grouping with this column, the group header is only the original column value (number).
Is there any way to get the group header also with the cell template?
Thanks
Boris

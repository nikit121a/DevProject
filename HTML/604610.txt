Hello,
I need to do following task in several classes:.
Load an CSV or XSLX File and keep an IWorkbook for a while as a (readonly) datasource to extract part of the data to DataTables:
Using the workbook after disposing the spreadsheetcontrol cases an Exception, that the workbook is invalid.
Is there a way to avoid the usage of the SpreadsheetControl (so do it without UI) ?
I saw, that one can use the Workbook class directly without UI control with an additiional document Server subscription.
Is this the only way or is there another "trick" ?
Thanks a lot in advance !

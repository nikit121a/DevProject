I am using the MapControl, and have settled on using Vector Layers that use ListSourceDataAdapters.  In these, I provide custom ObservableCollections of my objects to be mapped.
What I need now is a way to define these layers and their associated objects at runtime.  The DataSources are easy enough, but how can I define the Vector Layers?  I don't see any bindable properties on the MapControl for layers.
My goal here is to be able to provide multiple Vector Layers which will each contain a different category of data.  Ultimately, I intend to create a UI element that will allow the user to toggle these layers on or off.  I suppose this would resemble the way a Google map might show "restaurants" and "department stores" and "tourist attractions" all in a single map, but with these elements able to be turned off and not shown.

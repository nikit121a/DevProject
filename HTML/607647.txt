Hi,
I have to quick questions regarding the use of an collapsible accordion control
1)  I have the accordioncontrol in a layoutpanel to the right of the screen. But the collapse arrow then points the wrong way. Is there any easier way to change that than to override the collapse button template? If not do you have an example of that for reversing the arrow? Using the FlowDirection sets the scrollbar on the wrong side... Am I overlooking some property? 
2) If the layout panels allow resizing, and you resize the panel containing the  accordioncontrol and then collapse it, the accordioncontrol will collapse to the left rather than to the right and the size of the panel won't resize

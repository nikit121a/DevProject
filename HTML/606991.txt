I'm using the GalleryControl to show images, along with the HoverImage properties to let users see larger versions of the images when they mouseover.
The cool thing about the default thumbnail view is that i can set the layout so the whole image is shown, and not distorted:
But when the user mouses over a thumbnail to see a larger version, that larger version is stretched and distorted. Is there any way I can set the HoverImage properties so the larger version is not twisted to match the dimensions of the frame?
Thanks!

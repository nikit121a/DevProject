Dear DevExpress,
Accoring to the documentation, the '&' is supposed to perform a bitwise logical AND operation between two integer values.
See:Â 
This does not seem to be working on my system: an expression like '[value] & 128' is not accepted. Expressions like '[value] ^ 128' seem fine.
See attachment.
Is this a bug or am I mis-using the & operator?
Thanks,
Bob

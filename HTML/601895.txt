Hello guys.
I am working with bootstrap chart and the Y Axis labels overlap the container. 
I have spent lot of times looking for fix that, but it has been impossible. I found that, but I dont know oif this applyes for Bootstrap chart.
Does exist this functionallity for BootStrap Chart? (see image)
If yes, may you please place a example (VB or #C).
Thanks in advance

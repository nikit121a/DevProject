Hello
We have a strange issue on 1 productive server  with Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard.
Other 3 productive server s use Windows Server 2012 Standard
Development PCs have Windows 7 Professional
On development PCs, test and 3 productive servers, this problem doesn't exist:  
Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture and CurrentCulture  are set to de-AT right before using the report, but exported PDF shows that it was generated from default resx file.
To fix it, we reinstalled Windows on the server, upgraded DevExpress controls to 17.2.5 and it still doesn't take de-AT resources for the report.
What can be wrong on server or web site  ?

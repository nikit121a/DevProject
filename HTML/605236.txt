I am using DevExtreme dxDateBox and I have to use custom date format (dd.mm.yyyy).
As I have learned I must use external libraries like Globalize. I have looked it up and I find it to time consuming and because I am buying DevExtreme I would like to see a simple documentation about it from you and also an example how to use it.
Do you have a simple documentation which explains how to use it and an example.
Thanks, Einar

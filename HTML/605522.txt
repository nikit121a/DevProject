We have an app which uses the many of the dx-angular components throughout, but in atleast one section we will need the dynamism of the jquery version since the page will be database driven and I don't want a thousand line template to account for all the variations.  To do this, I have created a component in which I am attempting to create a data grid from a div and getting the error "$(...).dxDataGrid is not a function".  The confusing thing is that I can execute the line in the Chrome dev console with no error, but any normal execution of the code results in the error.
In the component, I'm importing dx.all, 
 I'm referring to the element via ViewChild,
 ...and executing the dg creation in ngAfterViewInit.  
I also tried ngOnInit and in a timeout, but I get the same result each time.
I also tried referring to the dist/js/dx.all.js in the angular-cli.json right after the jquery reference, but that didn't seem to change anything.
Thoughts?  Suggestions?

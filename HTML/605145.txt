Hi
I know XtraRichEdit has a syntax highlighting mode which can be enabled globally. But what I'd like to do instead is insert code snippets into a regular document, much like many cloud editors offer it (including the one here on DX support).Â 
The inserted snippets should be formatted with basic C# syntax highlighting and the usual "gray box background".
Do you have a working sample of something like this, or can you point me in the right direction?
Thanks,
Marco

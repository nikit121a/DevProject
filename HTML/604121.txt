Is it possible to select the *contents* of multiple cells in a grid with a mousedrag (or at all)?
Basically, I'm looking to replicate the behavior of an HTML Table, where you can partially select text from one cell, and then select partial or full text from other cells.
 The selection behavior I would like to achieve is like as below (open in browser and you can play with it)
Is it possible to get this behavior with a gridcontrol? Currently I can either select multiple full cells, or I can select the internal content of 1 cell, but am then locked into that cell and cannot select outside of it.

Hi,
since the introduction of the new scrollbar I have some issues  with TcxGrid and TcxScheduler.
At TcxGrid the scrollbar avoids the cellclick. At TcxScheduler there is a very strange behavior with the more events button. I have to wait until I can click it, otherwise a click on the scrollbar will be performed and the scheduler scolls far away from my desired event.
Please see the screenshots.
Regards,
Ollo

I'd like to be able to specify custom icons to use through out my project.
i.e. Cut, Copy, Paste etc found in context menus and message box icons
I have found examples of doing this for controls and message boxes I create but I need to effect all controls and message boxes including the ones create by your controls.
Example
Spell checked shows a "Spell checking complete" with the incorrect (for my project) information icon.
XtraSaveFileDialog also show message boxes with icons I need to change, I also notice this shows a wait form which is not my customized wait form.
I can imagine this being a lot of work but if we cannot currently do this we cannot use any of the code to customize icons because we introduce an unacceptable inconstancy.

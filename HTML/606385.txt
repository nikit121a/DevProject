I have two projects using the PivotGrid control in WPF.
In project #1 the default Context Menu is popping up when you right click in the Row Header area. (Screenshot attached.)
This project is actually using 
 of DevExpress for WPF.
Project #1 PivotGrid XAML:
In project #2 no Context Menu displays when right clicking in the row area.
This project is using 
 of DevExpress for WPF.
Project #2 PivotGrid XAML:
Did something change in 
for how to access this Context Menu? (I'd like the user to be able to use the Show Field List menu option in project #2.)

I have a Report bound to an object with some detail reports on it. I want to hide a detail report if the list of objects bound to it is empty or null.
In the designer i have this code:
However the formatting rule is ignored, and the detail report is always print, no matter is empty or not.
Also, I Have take noticed thaht, despite i have created the formating rules thru the designer, after close and reopen the desing view. The list of formatting rules is empty, despite the still present on the designer code.
Please see the attached captures

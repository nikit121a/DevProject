Hi,
I am trying to create class from where I can show notification messages.
Placed a custom template in the file App.xaml
And created a classÂ 
All code are from examples from your website.
If I run the code I get the message "Value cannot be null. Parameter name : dependencyObject"
Have the feeling that I need to set the template to make it all work but can't find the correct example to show me how to do it.
Can you please tell me if it is even possible and if so help me with example code that shows me how to create a custom notificatie with a custom template in C#.
Thanks in advance.
Kind regards,
Ernst Jan.

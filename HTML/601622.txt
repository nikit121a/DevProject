HI DX Team,
I'm trying to show a spinner (loading indicator) on switching tab. 
DXTabControl Xaml:
Starting an indicator is a piece of cake - I'm setting IsLoading to true in setter of SelectedTabIndex property, but hiding it makes me a headache, I cannot find any suitable event to hide it when tab is actually shown.
The main delay is generated by the sluggish controls loading reported under 
 ticket, so setting IsLoading to false just after loading data makes the indicator appear for the split second and then we have a 2-3 seconds delay without any indication.
Can you give me some advice how can I do it property?
Best Regards,
Kamil

Dear support,
After installation of registered  WPF components using the installer I noticed that no controls are showing up in the tool box. I can however edit a xaml and add code to reference and use any of the components. After having done that, they show up in the  designer and I can configure them using the property editor.
I also noticed that the main menu  "DevExpress" is empty except for one entry named "Receive update notifications".
I removed, reinistalled and repaired  the installation but the problem persists.
When starting in the company I installed a trial version of the components as I did not have a license then.  
Any clues? 
Kind regards
Mark Sandy

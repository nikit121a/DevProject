I have a data model with many-to-many relationship (one Company can have many Roles, One role can be assigned to many Companies).
I would like to implement a DataGrid with Edit Form conatining multiple selection Drop Down Box to assogn Roles to COmpany when adding a new record.
How can I pass a data from controller ang how should I bind it to Drop Down Box ?
How should I process data in POST and PUT actions to receive and process array of selected records?
Do you have any example of multiple selection Drop Down Box in DataGrid's edit for?

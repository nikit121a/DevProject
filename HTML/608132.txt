Hello
I have a strange problem, but I can't reproduce it in sample project. I also cutted my project to have simple objects, but still can't reproduce...
So, could you tell me how could I debug this? I need to understand why does the protected content appear and disappear in this case (see video)?
Totally my problem is opening by popupWindowShowAction an persistent obect to create it (instead of new button). But first time it is show protected content even at bool property. If I once open this object with rowView or new/addPerson button, then it open well without protectedContent till I change view (go to another list and open Registration detail again).
What could I check to understand what is cause of this? Or maybe you could suggest to check/change something?
This is simple opening popupWindowShowAction handler:

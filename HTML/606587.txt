Hello there,
In my app I have the following situation;
On a view I have a grid bound to a collection of viewmodels (as opposed to a bunch of model objects).
From that view I want to open the selected viewmodel in a new tab in my docmanager. Which I can doÂ as per the below code;
Now, in the code above, the SelectedVM is passed as a parameter to my viewmodel and that is all good and working but my query is, how does one actualy set the datacontext of the view from the viewmodel?
One could write this question another way as "How do I set the datacontext of the view from a passed in parameter?"
Does this situation possibly smack of bad design? Do people often bind gridviews to collections of viewmodels?
Thank you kindly for any thoughts
John

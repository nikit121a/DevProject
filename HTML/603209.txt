Hello,
When a MVCxDashboard is loaded , a DataLoadingWeb event is raised for each data source to fill the dashboard's data cache and one is raised for each dynamic list used by the dashboard parameters.
However, when the dashboard's data cache has expired and that an interaction  is executed, a DataLoadingWeb event will be raised for each data source but none will be raised for the parameters. As a consequence, the look up values are not updated and may not match the current data to which they are bound.
Please, find attached an archive containing a dashboard layout as well as its query text. You'll also find an SQL query that updates data the "Commercial" parameter is bound to.  The database used is AdventureWorks2012.
To reproduce the issue : 
- open the dashboard
- check the lookup values available for the "Commercial " parameter
- edit the data base using the provided script
- wait for the cache to expire
- perform an interaction to trigger the DataLoadingWeb event
-  once the data are refreshed, you should see that the look up values available for the Commercial parameter have not been updated as they should have.
Thanks in advance for taking care of this, good luck.
Have a good afternoon.
Regards

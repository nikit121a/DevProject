Hello,
since we're using a custom ORM in our business solution, entities need to be instantiated through a factory method.
When using your new scheduler control, entities are added to the bound collection using the default constructor. This leads to errors and exceptions when using our ORM.
Is there a method or an event, that allows hooking the instantiation process.
Regards

Hello,
I am using 
as a navigation bar and 
as the bar's items. 
On the item's 
event I define the item's ContentControl:
I noticed that 
adding a 
 to ContentControl the 
 Font property is changed.
The 
has the same Font 
 had 
 it has been added to ContentControl.
See the attachments for further details.
Could you please explain why this is happening? Should I add 
differently to 
? Is 
the wrong event to add controls to the item?

Hi,
I'm using the TcxTreeList to list layers, like in a CAD software.
In the first column I list the layers. In the second column I have added an icon that shows / hides each layer when I click on it, so that I can control their status. So far, It works very well.
Now, from the header I already manage all the layers all together. For instance, clicking on the header in the second column I can show or hide ALL the layers, instead of just one. This help me to avoid to show / hide them clicking one by one.
The only issue is that I don't know how to change the icons to the whole column. I tried to use OnCustomDrawDataCell with OnMouseUp and OnMouseDown with no luck.
Could you help me to achieve the result?
Please see the screenshot.
I? look forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
G?ianluigiÂ

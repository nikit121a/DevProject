Â Hi
on a project i just introduced a  skincontroller
And now some of my icons have purple edges, the png have both the one from imagecontainer and running program.
The icon is from an Actionmanager and put on an Speedbuttons action. this happens dynamical.
so no direct load of glyph. just speedbutton.action := myAction.TheAction;
Have you seen something like this before?
Thanks

Dear support,
When searching a value in a dxTagBox widget that isn't present, the popup should open and show the "No data to display" value.
In this build it opens but closes immediately. This is not desirable and doesn't match the rest of the widgets.
Is it possible to fix this issue.
Thanks in advance
Hans

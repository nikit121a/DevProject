Hello,
we have changed to Version 17.2.4 from 16.2.3 and now I have an Access Violation in my COM Application.
When I open my Form with DevExpress cxGrid and cxVirtualTreeList the first time all works fine. I close the window and open it again then the access Violation is raised.
See attached my call stack.
Maybe you have an idea what could be the problem here.
Best regards
Michael

The auto complete property is not 100% what I'm looking for.
 
As the use types, I want the list of items to automatically narrow down to only include the items that start with what the person types.
So using the examples in the above link ...
As the user types 'B' I want the list of items to shrink to only include
   Barcelona
   Berlin
with the first item (Barcelona) highlighted
Then when the user types 'e' the list should filter down to just
  Berlin 
I have accomplished something similar using the built in ComboBox property using the AutoCompleteSource property but am not finding the equivalent in your control.
Thanks

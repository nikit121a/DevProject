Currently I am using your WinForms - but will be upgrading to the Universal in a month.  Since that includes everything - I am hoping you might have something along the lines of what I will detail below - that I could customize to fit my needs...
I am dealing with datasets and datatables in .Net WinForms .  My application will be constantly creating and destroying DataTables in a particular DataSet.  I have no control over what the end user will be doing here so they can be filled with data from any number of sources - and I do not even have much control over the names. :)    We allow the users to query data, which generates a DataTable in the DataSet - but we also allow them to pull in data from CSV files and other sources - which also create DataTables in the DataSet.  
Now what I would like to be able to do is to provide a visual representation of the current state of a DataSet to the end user.  It would show the Data Tables and their names (fields would be nice - but not necessary I think).  It would be nice if it looked a little bit like the DataSet Designer in Visual Studio - in terms of showing a graphic representation of the DataTables - but I am flexible here.  
At this point I am looking at just providing a read only visual representation - but might later want to add in some functionality to allow the users to record some relationships between the DataTables. 
I am using WinForms - with standard DataSets - and DataTables.   I think I had seen some demo videos (?) of your DataAccess capabilities of your XAF components.  Maybe I am wrong - but might that be something that would work?  Would it work with standard DataSet/DataTable components?
Are there components (or something that I could use to get started) that DevExpress provides?   If not - are you aware of anyone else who might provide this particular type of component?  
thank you

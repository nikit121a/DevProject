Greetings, I have an issue setting the height of a cardview control.  In other projects where I am able to use a splitter, I can use the resize events and set the cardview height to 100% of the client area using javascript.
In this current situation, I have a cardview in Table Layout Mode, in  a partial view, and it is injected as part of a bootstrap 4 column like this:
If I set paging to Endless, the cardview contracts and only shows Header Pane, one card (with scrollbars to show the rest) and the footer.
If I set paging to something normal, it adheres to pager settings and the control at least seems to conform to verticalscrollableheight
These are my settings (those of interest anyway)
If it matters any, the card content is custom, but that part generally works.
My main question is, lacking a splitter control to be able to get pane.clientheight, is there way to set the cardview to max bootstrap column height?
Also, asuming that I want the cardview to fill the client height and use endless paging, what settings do I need to use?

Dear Whom it may concern,
 
We are currently using DevExtreme ver. 15.1
After upgrading to ver. 17, for the js/localization/dx.all.ko.js, which is seen as Korean language related files we call Globalize.addCultureInfo() Function, which does not support in ver. 17
Other language file which has been upgraded to ver. 17, the language-related files calling function has been changed. Only the ver.15 and Korean language related files can call the same functions. 
We would like to know if the language support has been discontinued or if there is an issue regarding the upgrade process. Could you inform us the solution to this problem? 
If the additional language support has been discontinued, we would like to know if there would be further supporting plan.  
 
Thank you.

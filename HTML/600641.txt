Hello,
I have Devexpress 17.1.7 installed, and I am using XAF to create a web project.
I am trying to run TestExecutor using Jenkins after the build.
When running TestExecutor from the command line it works as expected.
When running TestExecutor form Jenkins I receive the following warning in the log file:
 
Jenkins service is Logged as LocalSystem and has enabled "Allow service to interact with desktop".
I managed to simplify the scenario to the following steps:
1. Create a windows service that runs TestExecutor on start, logged as LocalSystem and with "Allow service to interact with desktop" rights.
When starting, the service runs the following code:
2. For the test location, I used XCRM_Lead_Create from XAF demo.
3. Start the service and  wait until TestsLog file is created.
I attached a project that creates a service which runs TestExecutor on start.

Greetings,
I would like to make a questions based on an issue that i am facing.
My scenario is as follows:
I have a XtraReport and i would like to know if i can embed a PDF file to it. 
In other words, show one or more PDF files that has been uploaded to the system .
I know for a fact that i can show text that was saved in the database through the HTML Editor using a RichText , and i also know that i can show pictures on the report as well. But can i show a PDF file?
If not, can i at least show the report and then once the report ends show the PDF as well?
If my scenario is unclear, i will try to provide as much more information that i can.
I greatly appreciate any kind of help and guidance.
Thanks in advance

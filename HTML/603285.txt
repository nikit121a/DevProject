I have an ASPxPageControl with several TabPages. I would like to be able to have the TabText occupy two lines and be able to control where the TabText breaks such that I could have:
TabTextLine1
TabTextLine2
I have been unable to figure out how to do this. I will be changing the TabText from the client side.

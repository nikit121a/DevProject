Hi,
 I would like to use the ChartControl SaveToFile / LoadFromFile feature, but every time I try to load the chart layout the following message is displayed :
Â 
Please use the attached sample to reproduce the problem. 
Steps to reproduce :
- Run the application
- Chose Open  ribbon button and select the 'DashboardChartSample.xml' file
A chart with data is displayed
- Clic the 'Restore Chart Layout' button located to the right of the ribbon
- Select the 'chart_172011_1.xml' and clic Open
The 'cannot be rendered' message is displayed
You can try to export and load your own layout file using the 'Save Chart Layout'.
How can I fix the problem ?
Thanks

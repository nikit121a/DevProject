HI,
I'd like to partially paint a grid cell with multiple solid colors in terms of percentage where each solid color represent something (not linear gradient)
See attached sample for example - here green color represent % OK, red means % wrong, yellow means % warning.
Would you suggest how to achieve something like this, so far all the API and documentation i've read fills rectangle in one or two colors. Please do correct me.
Many Thanks,

Hi Team,
We have a WPF application based on  the Pivot Grid (current version is 16.2.11) showing quite a lot of data. Users change the columns setup a lot and the amount of RAM consumed grows a lot when there's much data to aggregate. I can't share the original code, but I have created a sample to demonstrate the problem.
Initially there're 3 columns added to the row area and 5 to the data area.  4 more columns is available to add to the data area.
Hitting the button on the top will generate 400k records and load them to the grid. The memory consumption goes up to 500-600 MB. Adding one more column to the data area makes it grow to almost 700 MB (screenshot 1).
In the production application the numbers are much larger (ie the "normal" consumption is 1.5 GB , but if you add more columns it can grow up to 4-5 GB and the performance gets very poor).
I have analyzed the memory consumption with dotMemory and it looks like the largest part of it is taken by PivotSummaryValue objects (screenshot 2) .
Please advise if there's a way to optimize the performance. 
The project and the screenshots are in the attached archive. The code is also available here:
Thanks!

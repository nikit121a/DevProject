I put one ASPxSpinEdit in the ASPxGridView DataItemTemplate.
I want to get the ID of the row where the SpinEdit number changed. While doing it very conveniently with CustomButtonCallback, I could not do this in a situation like this.
Row Id is registered as UniqueIdentifier in the database.
I would like help in this regard.
The application is a basket application.
Thank you.

Good morning.
Properties that do not exist.
- OnCustomDrawCell >> as I can in a cell modify the background color. Before we had access to the TColor of the cell. Now how is it?
- TdxDBGridCheckColumn >> OnToggleClic - Now in the new version how can I access this property? Is there an equivalent?
Â 
Thanks

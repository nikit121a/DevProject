This approach works perfectly fine.
In this case, we still need your input for below scenario,
1. If grid contains 10 records and we click mouse (between 1to10 rows) on blank place at right side of  last removed column ,       row get selected. 
    How we can avoid this row selection?
2.  As this even fires all the time, performance issue comes. 
     How can we avoid firing this event all the times?

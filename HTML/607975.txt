Hi Team,
I have two requirements as described below, any help would be greatly appreciated.
I have a button which is constructed using 
, when a mouse hover on a button it brings some styles (Typical button states), I understand that this is default behavior of a button. Is there any way to keep the same styling when mouse hover/click happens on a button? Â 
I have enclosed a document with screenshot describing expected behavior and sample that I build.
Please help
Thanks,
Hari Prasad

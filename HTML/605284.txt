I tried to apply the 
 example to my XAF Web Application.



Javascript code is hosted in ReorderGridView.js. 



I moved all script links to Default.aspx 



I think i'm on the right way, however a javascript error occurs - 
I checked everything with the help of the asp.net 
, you provided, but cannot get it to work
Thank you for your help.

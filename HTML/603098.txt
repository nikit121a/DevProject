Steps to reproduce:
- Create a PivotDashboardItem;
- Add a measure to Values and set its format as: Currency, Unit = Ones, Precision = 2, Include group separator = True;
- Add a random dimension to Rows;
- Add a Icon Range format rule (any)  to the measure added in Values;
- Change the values' measure caption to something short (the caption needs to be shorter  than the width of the largest value)
- Export (Print Preview) the Pivot  - some values will be truncated;
See animated gif of these steps.

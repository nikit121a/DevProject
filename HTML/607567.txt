I would like to be able to keep the column headers on screen at all times while the gridview itself is show.
I don't want the gridview itself to have a scrollbar.
The page will scroll, at all times while the grid is on page the header would show. as soon as the user scrolls past the gridview the headers would disappear.
Is it possible?

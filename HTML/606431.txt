Hi Support,
 I can't seem to find a way to provide a list of connections in code to the end user report designer when creating a new report (screen shot attached). I don't want the end user to fill in the connection wizard for every new report.Â 
I assume I need something like the following link but for WPF? 
Any help is appreciated.  
Thank you.

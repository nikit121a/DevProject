I have a ComboBox with values in it and some of the values have spaces.
For some reason the ComboBox posts the desired value, but whenever there is 
a space in the selected item the ComboBox posts the desired value BUT with additional 
values separated by commas.
How can I make the ComboBox post the desired value only?

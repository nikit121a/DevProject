Hi 
Please find demo attached.
In scheduler you will see Budget and Journal section for a date. In which Red  one is non editable and green one is editable.
And you can not move task from budget column to journal column. you can do editing and adding in only Budget column. 
You can do anything with task in Journal column. Now this is how the demo works.
Now I am looking to just copy and paste Red one task to Budget section and 
Ability to move task from Journal-column by dragging a journal entry to the Budget-column. And the one we copy should exist there.
Its like a copy of Journal-column task.
How to achieve this. Can you make changes in demo.
And one more thing how we using keyboard copy and paste task/ or any other options you provide in your control?
Thanks

Sorry for simple questions..  no easy way to find answers. 
WPF
VB.net
Need to turn scrollbars to show automatically for VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL on the scheduler control.
Appts are fixed width.  So after about 15 appts, they go off the right side of the schedule.  I need the horizontal scroll bar to appear at that time so I can see all appointments.
The same thing happens when a resource is added to view.  Need to be able to scroll.
Please show me where and how to add these bars..
Thank you.

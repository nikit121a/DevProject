Just to add, it's absolutely crazy not to offer everything on a piece by piece basis.  With respect, because obviously we are not party to the internal discussions, but I really can see no reason for doing this at all.  When has anyone ever requested less flexibility or choice in development?  Please hurry up and split up the packages.  So there would be more packages for you to manage, is that the only downside?  Surely its all automated anyway.

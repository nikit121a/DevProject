Hello.
I started using your WebChartControl for a project i have and after some reading and practice i managed to  create and manipulate at run time using a custom dataset, the View, Series, Argument and Values of the chart based on values from some comboboxes and a radiobutton.
Everything works fine but the problem is that when i change the View to Pie the values on the legend are shown in '%'
I have attached a video that demonstrates the above problem and also below you can see the code i'm using to initialize the WebChartControl.
Probably i'm missing something out, or the Pie chart is working differently from the rest.
Based on the video, how i can replace the % on the legend with Months(like Bar View) and if possible to show value instead of % on Pie chart.Â 
Best regards, 
Christos .

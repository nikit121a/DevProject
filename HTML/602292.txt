Dear Michael,
maybe i need your help again, i hope you can solve my "new problem".
how can i trigger the "custom summary event" if i click any row in the grid?
i have found the "SelectionChangedEvent" from the datagrid, this works without problems.
But how can i fire the "CustomSummaryEvent" if i click a new random row?
I wann show the selected items in the right corner of the datagrid, like "Selected Rows: 5".
Can you please help me again?
thanks,
mario.

I am reviewing the following 
 and had a question about the advanced option.
I am looking at the following method:
I am using external filters on the grid, which I am passing via the ClientSide BeginCallback as e.customArgs.
What I would like to know is whether or not I can access these values from the GridViewModel.
The model contains a lot of properties and it is difficult to traverse.
It would be awesome if I could get the values of the customArgs from the GridviewModel.
How would I do that?
I have attached an image, and if you need an example, please use code from the demo I referenced.
Thanks in Advance.

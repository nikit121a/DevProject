Hello 
Using the Dashboard viewer - I am seeing some times when changing a view or loading the dashboard can take a good amount of time (5-10 seconds). This may be partially due to the environment of the machine I am running it on.  At this point I am not too concerned about the time.  However, I would like to provide feedback to the user that there is actually something going on - and they should not be clicking on other buttons, etc.  Perhaps even something as simple as changing the mouse cursor to an hourglass, etc. while the changes are taking place.  
What is the proper way of doing this?  Do I write code in the Loading event of the Dashboard Viewer?   Is there a better place to do this?

Hello!
 I got pretty far in what I am trying to accomplish, but there are still some issues left that I am having troubles with.
It's concerning the appearance of the cells / column and band headers.
In the attached image you'll see my problem. I added some behaviour to the grid, so you can Drag and Drop multiple cells(extended the example E3533).
In this decorator the event CustomDrawCell is used to draw the rectangles to indicate the drop area.




I have another decorator where I change the appearence according to the values of the cells. This is done by using the RowCellStyle event
this is what I do on RowCellStyle(to preserve the standard behaviour on selection I only apply the style to cells that are not selected):



however whenever a cell appearance is changed with RowCellStyle event, the rectangle isn't drawn anymore.
is there a better way to do it or any suggestions?
I have another issue with the CustomDrawColumnHeader and CustomDrawBandHeader, where i simply would like to change the background color, but it seems that this is overridden by some standard - Handler. 
In general I would like to avoid to set handled to true and implement all the drawing myself...

                                The PDF Viewer has several types of popup menus that can be invoked by an end-user for bookmark options, bookmark tree, page content, a thumbnail, and thumbnail options. 
This example shows how to hide the popup menu for the bookmark tree and remove specific items from the page content popup menu.
To customize items of the PDF Viewer's popup menu, handle the 
 event. This event fires every time an end-user opens a popup menu in the PDF Viewer. 
Each popup menu type has a unique set of bar items that are located in the bar item link collection. To access a bar item link collection, check the popup menu type using the 
 property and use the 
 property.
To hide a popup menu, clear all items from the bar item link collection. 
To remove an item from the popup menu, find the item by the caption in the bar item link collection and then remove it.

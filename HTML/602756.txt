I am creating a simple report which produces a list of products. There is a field against the product called Last Issue which is a datetime field. What I want to do in the criteria of the report is only show products where the Last Issue date is older than a year. I can add a criteria where I manually set the date to 01/02/2017 and this works fine. However, I need to enter an expression such as DateTime.Today.AddMonths(-12). However, I cannot see a way of entering this and getting the system to accept. I am sure I can do this in code with the CriteriaOperator but I would like to achieve this in the Report Designer, without using any code. Is this possible?

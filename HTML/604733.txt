Hi
I have a DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Core webapplication and i am using resource files to translate the UI.
I am using @Localizer  to translate the words on the UI and this works just fine. 
Now according to that, i wanted to use the @Localizer to translate the DevExtreme.DataGrid column captions but it this doesnt work:
Is there a way to use the @Localizer to translate the column captions?Â 
Thanks a lot

Hy,
we have a problem with our new server Windows server 2016.
The last version of installation DevExpress on Windows server 2008 R2 is ok.
Now on new server when i launching my report mvc return an immediate error "impossible create a document for current report: Internal Server Error" .
Can i help me ?
There's a requirements or component that i must install on new server ?
Thanks for all.
Bye
Claudio

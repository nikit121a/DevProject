Hi support; 
I have a  @Html.DevExpress().Dashboard(settings => { settings.Name = "Dashboard"; }) created in an ASP.NET MVC application. Within this Dashboard I've included a Gauge widget. Within the Chrome developer console I call Dashboard.SetVisible(false) via javascript, then Dashboard.SetVisible(true), and each time a gauge disappears. Please see attached screenshot. 
In the Chrome console an error is thrown: dxCircularGauge incident occurred. Code: W2103  DXR.axd?r=1 228.1 22.., 15 12-vzBcg:120867
Please advise. 
Thanks!

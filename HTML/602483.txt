Hi ,
I would like to pass the value of a dependency property to a mainviewmodel. 
As you can see in the example attached, I have a MainWindow that simply calls the other View called Main.
In its model I have two properties, Property1 and Property2. I want to set these properties and pass them to the TestView View.
TestView has a Dependency Property Called MyProperty and a field Called "LabelValue".
I don't know how to join MyProperty with LavelValue in the ViewModel.
Could you please help me?

Hi Team,
I'm trying to implement the following feature, but I would like to get your advise how to approach it.
Here's a description of a sample task:
I have a PivotGrid with orders. Execution date field is in the column area, price and quantity are in the data area and Client name is in row area.
So the grid shows the amount of products and their prices ordered by a client on a particular date.
What I want to achieve is to show the difference between the  current and the previous date value (the delta) for each field instead of showing the actual values. E.g.
instead of this:
             Order Date
             |      01-01-2018  ||  10-01-2018      ||  15-01-2018      |
             | Quantity | Price || Quantity | Price || Quantity | Price |
Client1 |   100       |  300  ||   150       |  400  ||  50         |  100   |
I want to have this:
             Order Date
             |      01-01-2018  ||  10-01-2018      ||  15-01-2018      |
             | Quantity | Price || Quantity | Price || Quantity | Price |
Client1 |   100       |  300  ||   
|  
||  -
|  -
|
*the numbers explanation: 
 = 150 - 100 | 
 = 400 - 300 | 
 = 50 - 150 | 
 = 100 - 400 
Please see the screenshot as well.
I guess I could do this in CustomCellValue event handler, but I'm not sure how to access the other data outside of the current DrillDownDataSource.
Any help would be greatly appreciated . Thanks!

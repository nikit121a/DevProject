hi Dev express team
I am facing a challenge with  v7.1 ,  I need to turn on/off other UI controls depending on if a TreeListNode bool column checkbox is checked or not.
I tried on MouseDown but it is to early,  I tired to add a
 the column but it does not update the Node["Column"] value 
I was able to implement GetCheckedNodesOperation approach however, it does I hove not found the correct event that execute this code on time, I never got the correct behavior. 
I know you have other events/methods available newer versions, but upgrade is not an option at this time
Can you please advice?
Thanks,
Gerardo

I have attached a zip file containing two screenshots of the same code, one at 100% resolution scale and one at 150% scale. The grid control is inside a LayoutControl parent with the UseParentAutoScaleFactor set to True.  At 100% resolution, all the column header captions are clearly visible and there are two cards side-by-side in the details region of each row. At 150% resolution, the column header captions of the narrower columns are obscured and only one card appears in the details region. 
Should the UseParentAutoScaleFactor resolve these scaling issues? Or must they be resolved with code? What is the best approach for resolving these scaling issues?

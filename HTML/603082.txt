Hi guys,
I was wondering about a way to use both dxDatagrid and  DevExtreme.AspNet.Data  with Entity Framework' navigation properties.
I'm using the dxDataGrid with DevExpress.data.AspNet.createStore as Store.
I've modified the DevExtreme.AspNet.Data  to work with asp.net WebForms (just the DataSourceLoadOptions class, the logic of the query engine
has not been modified).
Everything works perfect (pagination,filtering,sorting...) but I cant query the dataBase over foreign keys.
I've got a table with some columns that are foreign keys to other tables (thus Entity framework creates the proxy for this external key) .
For example:
Table Cant:
Cant_Id -> Integer (Primary Key)
Codice -> Varchar
...
...
Fil_Id -> Integer (Foreign Key)
The column Fil_Id is a reference to the table Fil
I want that the dxDatagrid' Fil_Id column displays not the Fil_Id foreign Key value but some others related entity property values.
How should i customize the store for that? does the DevExtreme.AspNet.Data allow this kind of behaviour? 
I know that Entity Framework uses the expression " DbQuery<TResult>.Include(Entity.property)  " to load the related entity through the proxy
Just tell me if you need some others infos.
Thanks

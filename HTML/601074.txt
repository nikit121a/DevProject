Hi, i have binded to data report. There is richtext edit withÂ  some text. in text i put fields in bracket [FieldName]. If i preview report bracket fields are replace with data. But. if my field is DateTime its replaced with full date with hours and minutes and i want only date like "2017-01-21" normaly if i use xtralabels i can set formating in control property but how can i use formating for fields directly in text ? (same for decimals which i want to show in N2 format.

Hi There,
We are using devexpress 17.2.4 in our win-form application. 
We are using Visual studio 2013 with SQL Server 2010 in our application. 
We have used chart control using chart wizard in our application. 
We want tooltip to show data on hover in our pie chart. We could get tooltip in XY chart but we could not get tooltip in pie chart. 
Can you please give us sample application or example to resolve above issue. 
Please find attached screenshot for the same. ("ScreenShot1.PNG" )
Thanks !

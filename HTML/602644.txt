Hi,
I have created a sample example to demonstrate the issue I am facing, the fiddle has been ran on IE11, Edge, Chrome, and Firefox.
Firefox and Edge does not give this behavior, however the behavior occurs in Chrome and IE 11.
Background:
We have a parent div - that consists of child divs - in one of the child divs this editor is placed.
The size can dragged around, so height and widgets of the widget can be changed. 
Dragging the parent to around size around 20-30px, the dxDropDownBox just sits there so that the "Select Value" text is half visible.
On click (on the dropdown icon), the dxDropDownBox text "jumps" up inside the div and  now the whole dxDropDownBox input box is visible.
Can you advise on what to do?Â

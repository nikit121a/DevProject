Hello,
i´d like to use alternating background colors for ListBoxItems while using different Themes.
It seems that the alternating background colors are not defined in the Themes? Is that right?
Should i define the alternating background colors in the Themes Editor?
If i define them myself, like the code below, it works, but it doesn´t look of course very nice with every theme...




Thanks

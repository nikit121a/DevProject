Hi,
In the scheduler, the description not show anymore in the list box (for object dxsch:ResourcesPopupCheckedListBoxControlSettings).  
Description of selected items still visible on the dropdown header, see attachment  for result exemple with items Unassigned and Albert Sergent have been selected.
The only property set for the ResourcesPopupCheckedListBoxControlSettings is SchedulerControl="{Binding ElementName=scheduler1}"

Dear DevExpress support,
In our application we use the propertygridcontrol without vertical lines, but we still want to use a border....
But with border, the rowlines makes the Top-border extra thick. I attached a sample to show the dilemma.
I tried to place the control on a panel control, with negative locations based on BorderlineWidth, but it will be a lot of plumbing and unpredictable results if RowLineWidths and other layoutsettings are changing.
Is there a solution ?
With greetings, Ton.

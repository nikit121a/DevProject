Hi,
So instead of using my own buttons I am trying to use the ChartBarController buttons so I can swap to different chartcontrols easily.
When I control loading a templated layout, I save the source and then restore the source.
However, when using the ChartController load layout button, the button's itemclick event fires before the file select dialog, so I can save the current datasource to a variable, fine...
However, can't figure out what event to use once the layout has been reloaded.Â  It's not the ChartControlLayout event...
So what event should I use?

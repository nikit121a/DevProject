I am using the pivot grid in compact mode and have come across two issues that I need resolved. The first issue is with pivot.OptionsFilter.ShowOnlyAvailableItems . I have applied a filter to my grid using the following code
The filter that I applied to the Company field works correctly and is also applied automatically to the Stores field as well and the drop down only shows stores that are available under the applied filter as expected. In the case of the HO Category the filter works when I drag it onto the grid and only the applicable HO Categories appear on the grid but when I access the dropdown on the filter itself I can still see all the other HO Categories that are not supposed to be accessible, how can I make sure that only the ones that a user has access to appear in the dropdown menu of HO Categories?
My second question is regarding the accessibility of the dropdown function for HO Department and HO Menu Item. I have included a screenshot of the filters when applied to  the grid. Only the HO Category filter has a dropdown to select specific categories. I need that dropdown to appear on the other two filters as well how can I make this happen?
Any help will be greatly appreciated,
Nate

Team,
I am using devexpress treeview to show data on the UI. The Columns are  getting re-generated every time we change the item source as because the number of columns can change .I am using the banded view to display the data.
Grid loads the data faster if it has 10-15 columns or number of column visible to view port. No issues here.
Though, If we have more than 30-35 column with 5 bands . it slows down drastically. It takes close to 15 second to load 30 column even if you have only 2-3 rows to display.
I have added the following code to defer the grid events , but still it's taking significant amount(10 seconds) to load the data.
 AssociatedObject.BeginDataUpdate();
                var view = AssociatedObject.View as TreeListView;
                view.BestFitMaxRowCount = CommonConstants.DefaultBestFitRowCount;
                 view.BestFitColumns();
 AssociatedObject.EndDataUpdate();
Pleased help.

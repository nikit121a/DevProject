I think I have found a bug with the CircularGaugeControl. I drop one onto my window and I end up with a pre-configured setup that includes a needle with the attribute IsInteractive="True". When I run the application, I can drag the needle around - this works correctly.
Now I set IsInteractive to False. At runtime, I can't drag the needle anymore - but each time I click the needle, it jumps to a random new location on the gauge. I see that the location isn't truly random - when I click the needle somewhere to the right of its rendering, it jumps to the right, and vice versa. But I expect nothing to happen at all...

Hi,
I use the GridView with the Compact theme.
The display of the grouped rows arrows  is a little bit confusing:
The arrow of the group should point to the bottom when the group is opened.
The arrow of the group should point to the  top when the group is closed.
 But now the direction of the arrow changes whenever the group gets activated/deactivated.
Instead it should be static...
Please find the demo video attached.
Kind regards
Andy

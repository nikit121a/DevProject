When using the Listbox with Templates, I am trying to work out how I can customise the placement of the context buttons, I can't seem to find a way to either link the context buttons to an element within the template or to find a alignment property as to where the context buttons show appear, I need them to show TopRight of the item, however they are showing MiddleRight.
How do we set the context button position?

Hi. I am trying to achieve that only one subnode to a node may be expanded.
I use the sample in Q26002  but the tree will not expand again after invoking collapseAll.
If I do the same server side it works ok (T492957).
Client code
Server code
Also a mini function does not work:
In both client code cases, I end up with the ttree collapsed.

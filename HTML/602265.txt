I have a a chart control bound to the selection of a pivot grid control. The pivot grid control can contain any number of data points. I am getting an out of memory exception on the chart control when i change the selection just a few times on the pivot grid control. My pivot grid control contains only 4 points in this instance. The delay in updating the chart control is set to 300 mili seconds and RefreshDataOnRepaint is set to false.
How is there an out of memory exception on 4 data points on only a few clicks. 
Please see a screen shot attached.

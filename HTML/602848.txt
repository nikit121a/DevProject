Dear Support,
we are evaluating the use of the diagram control in our application.
I have a container in the template designer bound to a view on my data base. I can see the shapes being populated.
however, all the shapes are displayed based on the "Layout Kind" setting. meaning in a single line/row...
I would like the background to be production floor layout image and the containers that are loaded from the database, I'd like to position (based on each container content) on a specific location on the canvas (i.e. the production floor image in the background).
is this implementation possible with diagram control if so, do you have sample demonstrating how to achieve this?
Thanks and Regards, Izaks.

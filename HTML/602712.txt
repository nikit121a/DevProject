Example:
 
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open and run the example app.
2. In the data grid labeled " Memory Data Source" click one of the 'Delete' buttons.
3. Wait a second. Note that at no point does the grid's loading panel appear.
 4. In the confirmation dialog select 'Yes' or 'No' .
5.  In the data grid labeled " HTTP Data Source" click one of the 'Delete' buttons.
3. Wait a second. 
I expect that these two grids should act the same and to 
 show the loading panel while the delete confirmation dialog is open since they both have their dataSource set to a component member of type `Group[]` with the only difference being how that array is populated.

I have a DevExtreme dxPopup Widget where the  MVCxDocumentViewer is contained (as partial view).
The partial view with the report viewer is called by 
call.
Now I try to customize the ribbon as it is describedÂ 
.
Because of the popup widget and the AJAX request I cannot place another element within the same partial view as the report viewer.
Is there a way to adapt the ribbon by the 'PreRender' event handler?

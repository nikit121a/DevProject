Hi,
We need to export Data from cxGrid to excel. We are using the function   
cxGridExportLink   
We have a problem keeping Grid data format : 
if we  use Native Format : the currency sign appear in the numeric column ( we don't want this), we want no sign by default
if we are NOT using the native format, all data are strings so we can't do calculation in Excel
How can we provide to keep numeric type of columns without having the currency  ?
(i provide a small exemple, with my excel files, and screen copy to show you how we are working). 
thank you
PS : i was thinking about the column field format is not good but i don't know how to change on the fly.

I have a DataGrid like in example 
Now I would like to filter the grid by column State
  .DataField("StateID")
            .Caption("State")
It works only, if one state is assigned, but it cannot find records, where searched state is one of the assigbed states
(ie. Nevada)
How to implement filtering in such case?

Hello,
I have DocumentManager and WindowsUIVIew on my UserControl.
The WindowsUIViews contains 4 documents and tile container.
When I set layout to Adaptive and add 4 tiles, there is scroll bar visible. Scroll bar is useless.Â 
How can I remove scrollbar?
Sample has been attached.
Best regards,
Patrick

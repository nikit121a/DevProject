Hello!
The  dimensions of the child components on the TcxPageControl tabs do not  change correctly if the children have the property  "Constraints.MinWidth" or "Constraints.MinHeight". For example, cxPageControl has 2 tabs. The  first tab contains the "Panel1" component with MinWidth = 500, and on  the second tab there is "Panel2" with MinWidth = 200. Both panels have  the Align = alClient property. After starting the program, being on the first tab, we can not make the form size less than 500 px. By moving to the second tab, the width of the window can be reduced to 200 px. But in the process of reducing the width of the panel it exits to the left. In the attached archive I provided a sample project for reproducing the problem and screenshots. It should be noted that there is no such problem in the standard TPageControl.Â

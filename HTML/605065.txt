I have developed a c# add-in used inside of SolidWorks.  I was disappointed to see that the devexpress reports sit there showing "waiting" when I try to launch them through the add-in but work fine when I run the same reports outside the add-in.  Someone else reported a similar issue when using reports inside of WPF so I tried the recommended solution.  It worked.. but it is an endless loop that pegs the processor when nothing is going on.  Not a good solution.  Any other ideas?  BTW, it would be good to add a warning next to that solution.  My users suffered performance problems and other strange behavior for over 2 weeks before I figured out that that "solution" was the problem.

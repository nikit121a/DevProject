Dear,
I've a simple  ASPxComboBox with AutoPostBack=true and OnValueChanged server side.
When normally change value of ComboBox  it's works well.
Now, I must do something on client side, for example with SetSelectedIndex.
When I must SetSelectedIndex I see combo changed but not fire OnValueChanged server side.
I've try use call PerformCallback on client side, in this case OnValueChanged server side fired but SelectedItem on server side is null.
I've try use AutoPostBack=false with SelectedIndexChanged="function(s, e) { e.processOnServer=true; }" /> but i've same effect.  
Why ?!?
Regards,
Rinaldo

Hello,
I need to  group Date-time values. I know, how I can do that (thanks 
).
But I have 2 date-time values. The example on the attached image.
There are two date: employes' Date of Hired (datHire) and Date of Fired  (datFire). And there are two fields (hired and fired), that takes two values: 1 or 0. 1 is mean, that datHire (or datFire) is between two dates (the user enters them himself).
For examlpe, the user enter these date s (01.01.2017 and 31.12.2017). The SQL-result is on the attached image (The first table) . And What I need to receive as result too (the second table).
How can I to combaine 2 date in one?
Thank you!

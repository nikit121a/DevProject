I use XPO with SQLCE 4.0.
If I create a new dataobject with decimal?, the value is shown as expected.
But if I save the object and restart the application, the value is shown with 4 digits after decimal point.
Example:
-value: 4 
-saved: 4.0000
How can I avoid this behavior without using a mask for the spinedit.
I made a small example and a video.

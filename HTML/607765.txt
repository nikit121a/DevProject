Hi.
 I've got a datagrid with a AdvBandedGridView in my application. 
I'd like to draw a rectangle around the full focused row. 
 I've set this : BandedGridView.FocusRectStyle = DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.DrawFocusRectStyle.RowFullFocus;
But I can't find out how to draw a customized rectangle and not only a dotted rectangle. Something with a plain red line could be perfect. 
Can you please help me ? 
Thank you.

Dear Support,
I have an application witch is using AspxRichEdit in order to edit docx and html files.
There is a problem with some documents when trying to open them. The editor does not render them entirely or is not render them at all in some cases.
I will give you 4 file examples:
 - "doc1_v1_loadsWithoutFirst2pages.docx"
the editor don't load the first 2 pages.
 - "doc1_v2_modified_loads all pages.docx"
is almost the same document as previous, but i removed some text from bullet "4."
this document shows all pages. I tried in many ways to find the cause of this. Even changed the extension from ".docx" to ".zip" and compared the XMLs. I couldn't find nothig special that could cause this behabiour.
 - "doc2_first2pages.docx" 
loads only the first 2 pages out of 24
 - "doc3_notLoadingAnything.docx"
not loading anything. Stays on "Loading..." forever
We also have problems with other documents. For some only the first 4 or 5 pages are renderd. We didn't find a pattern.
If I open one problematic document and save it back to disk, the editor saves the hole content in the new file. 
So the content exist in the editor's internal structure but for some reasons it doesn't render all the content in page.
I also made a sample with an empty WebForms Project that contains an AspxRichEdit editor.
Thank you an I look forward for a solution,
Robert

I am using the GridView control in a Master/Detail environment where the detail is a PageControl with 4 tabs.  Each tab has different editors in partial views rendered using Html.RenderAction (one is a CardView, another is 2 GridViews and another is a custom HTML table, the last is static HTML).  When I expand a master row's detail page row I am able to interact with all of the tabs as expected, both in cached mode and when I set it to reload on callback.  However, once I expand another detail row in the master grid, those new detail tabs do not allow any interaction.  The first set of tabs still works.  I can only reproduce this behavior in the Edge browser (Chrome and Firefox are fine). 
I was attempting to create a sample for you, but then I ran across the original example I derived my code from:
 
When I downloaded the project and converted it to DevExpress v. 17.2.4, I get a similar behavior to what I described above (again only in Edge).  However, I am able to interact some of the time with the second and third expanded detail page controls if I don not click on the text of the tab but in the margin around it.  This may be due to the different styling in use (PlasticBlue).

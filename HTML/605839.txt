Hello Support,
As the subject explains, when I apply a filter to my grid (within a tab control then a navigation frame)  the grid loses the sort and filtering when navigated back.Â 
It makes no difference to this issue enabling cache mode on the navigation  and tab control.
Is this expected?
I tried looking at saving the grid layout to a stream but the UserControl unloaded event isn't triggered on the viewmodel (POCO) when navigating away. It is triggered on  the code behind but the datacontext is then null so I have no where to save the stream. I don't want to save it to XML as the user could have many instances of the tab open with different layouts / filters.
Any help is appreciated.  
Thank you.

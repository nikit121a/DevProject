HI,
On your Spreed Sheet Formula Bar
When i use your Sum it does not work. It just puts a 0 for total
for example; =SUM(C2:C8) would result in 0
even  when all the cells are format to number and each of the cells have a value of 5
Does it matter that all these numbers where added from a mysql data base to the spreadsheet control

Hello,
I am using the dxScheduler in a hotel application. For my program an appointment is a hotel reservation.
I am using the Timeline View of scheduler. Usually the resources are the hotel rooms and don't fit in a screen. So I have activated the vertical scroll bars.
The problem is when  resizing the resources height, appointments are "hiding", without any warning!
I have tried to use the technique from this issue,
but this is not working in my case.
Obviously the code in the issue, assumes no vertical scroll bars.
It will be nice for the dxScheduler control, to inform about the missing appointments. This is very frustrating behavior, no error, no warning, just appointments missing. A User can never be sure, if all appointments are shown, or not!
Please provide some help about this issue.
It would be nice if the control had a method to inform about "missing" appointments.
Thanks!

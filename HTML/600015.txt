I  try to implement  refresh for documents of a tabbedView.
There I have 2 questions.
1. What is the best way to replace the control of a document?
2. What is the best way to show the refresh-button at the header of a floated document?
To replace the control of the document is not possible. There is no setter.
To replace usercontrol at the controls of the usercontrols parent doesn?t work, because "tabbedView.Manager.GetDocument(userControlNew)" returns null.
The only way I found, is to create a new document and remove the old.
But there are a lot of things to do for size, location, groupindex...
It seems to be a lot of overhead!?
I made a sample project of my solution.
Please tell me if there is a better way for question 1 and 2.
If it is the best way, perhaps the sample can help someone.

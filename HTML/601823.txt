I have a tcxGrid with multiple views.  When using a normal view the: 
CurrentView.StoreToIniFile(LocalDir+'searchresults.ini',
                                 true,[gsoUseFilter, gsoUseSummary]);
works great!.
However when I start with an empty view and create the columns on the fly, it does not save the columns and filters.  Is there something additional I need to do when I create the view on the fly?
Thank you,
Linda

Hello
In our XAF web application we often invoke reports directly from Actions.
We have 2 common situations: a Simple Action that just shows the report preview, and a Popup Window Action that prompts for some details then show the report.
Since moving to the ReportsV2 module the Popup Window scenario does not work.
I have attached a sample application but here are the details:
 In a View Controller I have the following code to show the Print Preview:
And this is invoked from a popup window action like this:
When this runs the popup window after the popup window is accepted, the popup window closes and the word 'undefined' appears in the top left of the browser window.
Is there a different way to invoke the report preview?
(I have attached a backup of my test db as well, but that is only to get the dummy report, you can create a new one called "Thing Report" if you donlt want to restore that db.)
Thanks 
Richard

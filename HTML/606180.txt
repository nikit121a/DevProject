My master and detailed grid both have bind to same type ObservableCollection<OrdersViewModel> 
My Master grid is below and see SelectedItems binded to Parent ViewModel property SelectedItems which is of same type ObservableCollection<OrdersViewModel>
In details section of parent grid I have another grid which same type ObservableCollection<OrdersViewModel> and inner grid's selected item is also binded to same SelectedItems as parent i.e. SelectedItems="{Binding Path=DataContext.SelectedItems, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=dxg:GridControl}}"
Now if I am expanding Details section and selecting a row in inner grid I'm getting selectedItems correctly as inner grid's selected row. After selecting inner grid row if I want to select some other row of parent grid it's again working find and selectedItems is correctly updated with parent grid's row. However if after selecting inner grid row if I want to select same row which contains the inner grid it's not updating selectedItems. 
I tried using CollectionChanged event but it's not triggered when parent row is selected after selecting inner grid row. Also tried  FocusedRowChanged,  FocusedViewChanged, but these are also not getting triggered.

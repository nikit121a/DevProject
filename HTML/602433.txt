I have a problem with Widget.
I have 200 documents. The control inside document is a GridControl.
I  click a button to hide 150 of 200 of these documents, but this action is very slow. I see the documents disappear one by one (10 per second).
I tried to put  view.BeginUpdate(); and view.EndUpdate(); but doesn't work.
 view.BeginUpdate(); 
            foreach (Document doc in view.Documents)
            {
                    doc.Control.Visible = false;
            }
view.EndUpdate();
Thers is another solution? 
Thanks

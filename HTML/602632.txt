Hi,
I'm loving the improvements to the scheduler, but I was wondering if you could help me please.
The attached image shows what appears when I click on a meeting (I currently have delete disabled) but I'd like to make it so that when a user clicks on theÂ  'Edit' option it carries out a redirect for me to another page rather than show an edit form (Clientside code).
Please can you advise how I can do that?
Thank you,
Stan

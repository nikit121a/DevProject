We've been using DevExpress/MVC successfully now or several years now using jQuery v1.6.2 and jQuery-UI v1.8.11 and are looking to update jQuery to a later version.
1/ What's the latest version that DevExpress supports? I believe I saw a reference in another ticket (T595081) to v3.0, but the latest jQuery release is v3.3.1.
2/ Any estimates on how long we can continue to use v1.6.2? That is, at some point will you officially no longer support older versions of jQuery ?

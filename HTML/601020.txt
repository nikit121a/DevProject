Hi,
Sorry if the ticket title it's not very clear ..
My problem is:
I have a combo box, it'sÂ Data Source has 2 columns, id and description.
Both are String columns.
If the selected value is 5+ or 4-, when the combobox displays values formatted with DisplayFormat string, in one case the 5+ becomes 5, in the other case 4- becomes -4.
But if I click and open the combobox's dropdown, the displayed values becomes correct.
I can't understand what i have to do to solve this.
I've attached a screencast and a little example.
Thanks a lot

Hey guys, I have created a very simple project to test out some of your controls. I have tested some date controls, textboxes, etc. They all work well. I was interested in using your form control as it makes creating a data entry screen much easier. However, whenever I put a form control onto my view, it just loads the view forever.

    Layout = "_DevExtremeLayout";
}
Here is my pages code:

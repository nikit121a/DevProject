Hi. DevExpress SupportTeam.
When I created a TextEdit style that does not specify a key, I can no longer edit the cells of the grid control.
The reason is that it does not inherit the default TextEdit I created. I would like to check how much the TextEdit style that does not specify a key affects each editor or grid control.
 
I have summarized the questions in the attached PDF so please take a look.
We also attach a solution that can confirm the operation.
 
Thank you.

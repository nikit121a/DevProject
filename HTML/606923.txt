Hello,
I have some combo boxes nested in user controls which are dynamically added withing an ASPxGridView EditTemplate.Â  I am trying to find a way to fire the server-side " ASPxComboBox1_Validation" code without setting the "Autopostback" for the control (as that causes everything to be auto-generated again.)
I have set the cbx as follows:
Is there a way to force the server-side validation from the client-side?
Thank you!
Jay

Good morning
I am trying to get the last date displayed in the scheduler.
When in Day or workingWeek, I've managed to to so with:  
        var largo = s.GetVisibleIntervals().length;
        var end = s.GetVisibleIntervals()[largo - 1].start;
However,  in Week or Month view, this does not work.
How can I find out the last date displayed in the month or week views of the calendar?
Thanks
Mariel

Hi,
I invoke a PopupMenu when I right click on a node. I would like to change the caption of a subitem's button at runtime when I click on it.
My PopupMenu has the following structure:
Button
Subitem -->  Button
                       Off
I need to change the caption of the button "Off" in "On" when I click on it.
I can do it for the "first level" of the popup menu but I don't know how to change the caption for the buttons inside the subitem. 
Attached you find a sample.
Cordially,
Gianluigi

Hello,
I'm using the XtraGrid in combination with some custom UserControls. These UserControls depend on the status of the XtraGrid's AutoFilterRow which in my case can be one of the following:
1) "column filter value transmitted" (when I entered a filter value in the AutoFilterRow of a specific column and pressed enter), 
2) "column filter value removed" (when I removed the filter value in the editor of the AutoFilterRow of a specific column and pressed enter) or 
3) "all filter values removed" (when I hide the AutoFilterRow)
Unfortunately, DevExpress does not provide me with events that can 
be adapted to

1) Overriding 
, firing the event for 1), and keeping track of the given filter settings.
3) Defining a custom event handler for 
and doing the following:
2) Defining a custom event handler for 
and doing the following:
The custom events fire as expected, everything is working fine.
I'm still not really satisfied with my implementation, though.
Do you have any suggestions how I could achieve the custom events in a nicer way?

Hi ,
I have a cxGrid with unbounded data.
In my application I can switch to different scales. I use therefore the ScaleForPPI procedure.
A table with master/detail rows  the master row is scaled correct, but the detail rows the width of the columns does not scall correct.
Initial (When DPI value is before the grid is visible) it resizes correct.
I have attached the before and after  scaling during runtime.
Best Regards
Rob Renaud

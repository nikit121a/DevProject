Michael,
I need to filter resources in Events List View. In other words I do not want to display Rousource2 when Resource1 is selected in the popup. The solution still displays the column for Resource2 after filter is applied. 
The approach described in E1255 does not provide a solution. The only way to filter resources in this example is to subscribe either to ResourceDataSourceCreated or ResourceDataSourceCreating unless there is a way to raise the events from the action controller. I need to filter resources after Events List View was created.
Thank you.

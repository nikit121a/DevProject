I have a DxDataGrid. The row editor is launched with a popup (I have checked with a form and I have the same problem).
 One of the field to edit is of type  string and I want to use a TextArea field type to input the text.
The text is a short description that may contain line returns (pressing enter).
But when I press enter, the text area editor does not append a new line character, it tries to validate the entire form.
The official demo of the textarea editor works well and accepts return chars.
What  am I doing wrong ?
The datafield name I'm talking about is "activite" 
Below is the html code of the component.
There is no js error in the console.
Thank you
  <dx-data-grid #siteGrid id="siteGrid" [dataSource]="siteDataSource" keyExpr="id">

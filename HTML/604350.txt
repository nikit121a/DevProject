Hi,
I have the following scenario:
- TokenEdit control with  EditMode set to "Manual"
- Separators property that contains exclusively ";" 
Why setting in code EditValue to a string than contains "," ("abc;def;ghi,jkl")  result is splitted into four strings, instead of the three expected ?
Same behaviour inputting text at runtime. 
I need that only ";" character determines conversion to text blocks, operating in manual mode
What I'm doing wrong?
Please look at attached project 
Thanks in advance
Davide

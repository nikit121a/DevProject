Does the devexpress provide any tools to help with usage tips? e.g. presenting popups to the user with useful hints on how to get the most from a specific element of the UI they have accessed?
These are usually provided in GUIs with a cycling set of hints on how to use specific screens, but which can be dismissed if the user prefers. They can of course be relatively easily created using standard popups, I was just wondering if devex has a skinned control for this purpose?

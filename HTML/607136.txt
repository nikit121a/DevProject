Hello,
using all the great new features in versions 17.2.x of Winforms controls, I am currently making our desktop application DPI-aware. Our app behaves well in many different DPI scenarios in Windows 10. However, I realized some misbehavior when running the app on a Remote Desktop session on Windows Server 2016 or 2012. This does not happen if the RDP session runs on a Windows 10 host.
For demonstration purposes, I used your  Ribbon form template and made it DPI aware by adding a manifest file.Â 
When running the demo locally on Windows 10 (Surface pro 4 with 200% display scaling), everything is fine.
When running the demo in a RDP session hosted by another Windows 10 computer, it's also fine (see first screenshot). 
When running the demo in a RDP session hosted by Windows Server 2012 or 2016, the default skin font size is not scaled which results in unreadable text. Conventional Winforms controls are not affected.
Could you give me some advice about this or do you know a workaround? It is essential for us to host our application in a professional Remote desktop environment using High DPI settings.
 
Thanks in advance.
Gerhard

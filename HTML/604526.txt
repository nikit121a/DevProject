Hi,
i try to build a custom ToolTip for a row in a DataGrid based on some conditions.
Thats works very pretty but unfortunaly the tooltip for the first time is different to the tooltip for the second time.
You can reproduce it:
Move the mouse to the row
Move it away
Move the mouse to the row again
We prefer the second one! How is it possible that the first one looks like as the others?
Please take look at my attached sample.

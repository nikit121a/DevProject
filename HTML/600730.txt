I added Dashboard for project but it shows error message "An error has occurred on an attempt to load the list of available data sources"Â on create new . Wasn't able to reproduce the same on sample project. Using the same configuration on sample project didn't reproduce the same exception.
What could be wrong with dashboard in Project?
There are images on debugging: It happens on Crete New click and according to debugging click event is uderfined.

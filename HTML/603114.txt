Hi
I have a ASP.MVC Web Dashboard, with grid view.
I'm creating a dashboard XML file with the MVCDashboard in Designer mode.
Could you please assist me in finding instructions for following filtering..
I have drawings which are revisioned.
A drawing can have any number of dates (date is a master filter by the way) or none.
drawing 1, date a
drawing 1, date b
drawing 2, date b
drawing 2, date c
drawing 3, date d
where dates a < b < c < d
I'm trying to "group" my grid items to show "latest date per item", like:
drawing 1, date b
drawing 2, date c
drawing 3, date d
I tried adding Day(max) as hidden field, and do TOP-N-1 by Max Day, but then the result is
drawing 3, date d 
 -> All drawings disappear that don't have revision for date d, and that's not what I want.
Is this doable with the Dashboard engine or do I need to do it in SQL side?
Here's a pic illustrating the data:

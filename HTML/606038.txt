At design time, the font size for an editor is set incorrectly when it's style is assigned a style controller. This happens when designing at 120 PPI.
The Delphi IDE is running with the monitor scale set to 120 PPI.
There is a datamodule containing a TcxEditStyleController.
The StyleController's Style font is set to Segoe UI, 9 point (height is consequently set to -15).
The StyleController's Scalable property is set to true.
There is a form with pixelsperinch set to 120.
The user places an editor, for example a TcxLabel, on the form.
The editor's style.stylecontroler is set to the StyleController from the datamidule.
The editor's font size is scaled so that the size is set to 7 (height is consequently set to -12)..
If the editor's style font property is set directly to Segoe 9 point, it is displayed as expected in the form designer. It is only after assinging the style controller that the font is scaled down.
Displaying the form and datamodule as text confrms that the pixelsperinch value is 120).
Note that when the editor is hosted in a frame rather than a form, the problem does not occur.

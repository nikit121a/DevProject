Hi,
In our application  a user has a list of available modules, depending on the rights of the user.
When a user closes the application while a module is open, the state is stored.
If the rights to a module are revoked , and the users starts the application the state is restored.
Since the user has no longer the right to a specific module, this module is not registred in MIF and the restore of the state throws an exception.
This because the self implemented ViewModelLocator returns null (after an exeption occures in the ResolveViewModelType).
What is the best way to intercep errors during the restore of the MIF state? The final exception now occures in the MainWindow InitializeComponents

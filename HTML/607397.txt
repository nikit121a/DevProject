How can I hide the gridview column headers when it is resized in adaptive mode.
The gridview is using material theme. 
I try to use below css to override but it did not work; it only worked when the default theme is used instead of material theme.
.dxgvAdaptiveHeaderPanel {
             display: none;
}
The column headers I want to hide are circled in red in the screenshot.
Thanks

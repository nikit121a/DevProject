Dear Support Team,
I am using one DevExtreme MVC chart where based on the series click i have to load another chart.
When i click on the series of first chart. i am calling point click event
Below is the code for calling point click of first chart:
In the above code i am getting value in param variable and then loading another chart based on it.
Below is the second chart extension:
and action method used to load the chart in below:
Above action method is getting called when page loads as well as when click on series of first chart.
But practiceName variable is always null.
Now here i need two things:
1.Â  This chart should not load when page load happens. 
2.   Second i need the clicked series of first chart.
Please let me know if you have any concern if any. 
Thanks,
Veera

Hello,
I tried to open a dxMenu bind with knockout programmatically, but without success.
How can I open a dxMenu?
Background:
I create a dx Menu with placeholder content (items) and after I click on it I want to make an ajax call and rebuild the dxMenu.
User sees the dxMenu for a short time and after that it closes (because it will be rendered again ).
Example:
 Thank you for your efforts!

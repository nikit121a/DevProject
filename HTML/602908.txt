Hi,
A big problem working with the ASPxGridView EditFormTemplates is that you no longer can access the controls within the EditFormTemplate from code but have to do A LOT of  FindEditFormTemplateControl() every time you go into edit mode. Is there no way around that? What are recommended ways of working with a compled EditFormTemplate?
Regards,
Patrik Johansson

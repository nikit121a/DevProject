Hi.
I have a customer viewing some pdf files in a winforms application we developed for them.
Some pdf displays incorrectly and we have found that in acrobat reader DC the option overprint preview must be selected to the pdf to display correctly.
I havent found this option in the documentation nor in the code, is the any way to activate it? is it supported in the actual version?

hello,
I have 2 questions. the results iÂ  found so far are very old or not getting the point. perhaps now 2018 the controls got new features.
1.
My navigtion on our Intranet website is already big. I use ASPxNavBar , is there any search ability implemented ? As a search panel in the  ASPxGridView for e.g. 
2. As i need a multilanguage platform i need a translation of all my navigation nodes, in the moment i use GetLocalResourceObject with App_LocalResources. Is there any smart feature of ASPxNavBar siwtching the xml files to other languages ?
thx

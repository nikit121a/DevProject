Hello,
Interactive sorting in report preview  activates ParametersRequestBeforeShow event. In my case I use ParametersRequestBeforeShow to assign default values to report parameters. As the result sorting in preview changes the report. Attached is sample solution. There is a video illustrating the issue in the solution folder.
Thank you.

Hello guys.
There are many tickets in your KDB  but I havent found the correct for me.
I want to sustitute the standar javascript alert by the PopupControl, including confirmation actions, show alert icons (question, error, warning), etc.
Do you have any sample where implement PopupControlÂ in web forms (#C or VB).
Something like a "Hello World" sample ;)

Hi DX Team,
we are experiencing a serious performance issue on advanced GridControl.
The delay seems to appear while grid has a lot of controls as a templates for GridColumns and is due to drawing/loading the controls thus it is not growing that much when large amount of rows are added but it grows as more columns with controls are added.
I've read following articles:
and got surprised by your answers.
Is there really nothing we can do about the lag when switching the tabs? 
Even when I'll load all controls on start the lag in the project is still about 2-3 seconds which basically annoys the users.
I've attached a sample project with grids advanced as much as in the full blown solution to illustrate the issue.
Please give me some advice how to improve that behavior.
Best Regards,
Kamil

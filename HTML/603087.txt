I am trying to have a "popup window" that allows the user to upload a file for processing in a XAF web app. IÂ am having trouble adding a FileData property to a non-persistent class, which I then use in the popup window. Specifically I get the following error after I try to browse to the file (which is demonstrated by the image "error.png" in the attached zip file.
When I look at the XAF log file (also included in attached zip file), I see the following error:
Steps to reproduce are:
- Run  Web app
- Click on "File Test"
- From file edit, browse to any file
- Error will show as soon as file browser dissappears 
I am relatively new to XAF, but could you please help me resolve this issue
Thanks,
Jarrad

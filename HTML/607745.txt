Hello Team,
I'd like to format data in RowArea  but i've no succes !
I've looked at your DrillDown Demo, and I see the same problem :
When numeric data are in the RowArea they loose their currency formatting (cfr Attachments)
In my code, I've a "Calculated" Field (Forecast). If i display it in the rowarea, it appears with 4 decimals ...
 Thank you for your help !

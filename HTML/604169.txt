I've got a component that displays 3 DxDataGrid. Each grid has its own distinct custom Rest datasource.
By the first grid,  I have a on/off switch that apply a filter on the first grid.
When the switch is clicked, the datasource gets reloaded and the grid is expected to be refreshed.
Instead of displaying the new filtered values of the first grid, all the the 3 grids gets refreshed (each of their data source being queried again !).
I put some traces and this is what actually happens : 
1) I click on the switch, on ValueChanged is called and the following code is executed:
 2) As a result the data source fetches the correct data from the server, the data is delivered to the browser
3) It should stop here but it continues and refetch all data of the 3 grids, like if I had click refresh on the browser refresh url button.  I do not understand what happens.
If I comment the line 
the filtered data is still fetched from the server, brought back to the browser, but is not displayed in the grid: the grid is not refreshed.
Hence my question: what is the best approach to refresh a data grid on interactive external filtering ?
Thank you.
[EDIT]
I see now why other data sources are also refreshed: they are indeed linked by look up. Still, I do not understand why once loaded with a filter (clientDataSource.load (... ) ),   it is loaded again after this.
Would it be possible to add a callback to the load call and do the refresh afterwards ?
[EDIT2]
I tried the following : 
But it only empties the grid : the grid is  filtered but I intend to filter the data from the server via the data source
Here is the client.component.html file : 
and the component.ts file :

Hi,
yesterday I created a theme based on "Office 2016 White".  Basically I just added 3 colors to the palette and applied them just on 2 controls.
Today I wanted to continue my work on the theme, but it looks like all colors have changed to random values.
Please have a look at the attachment. It shows the 3 colors I've added and it shows the CardView as example.
Yesterday the Card View looked like it should, based on Office 2016 White, today it looks like just random colors.
Basically all views look like Card View. Tinted to a weird blue.
Actually it makes the theme designer  unusable.

I have 2 grids. Grid A contains a list of counties grouped by region and county (2 levels of grouping). The user can select multiple counties from Grid A using Checkboxes. He then clicks an "Add" button and the selected counties getÂ added to Grid B. After Grid B is updated, 
 that were just added to Grid B.
More Info:
On initial page load, a DataTable is created. That is where the data for Grid B is stored.
The "Add" button click event adds the selected items from Grid A and then rebinds Grid B to the DataTable.

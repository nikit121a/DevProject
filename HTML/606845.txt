I am in the process of creating a new application and wanted to see if I could get some guidance from you guys on the best approach since I will be building it with your components.  I am planning to create something using WPF with MVVM architecture.  I have looked at both the scaffolding wizard and MIF and am interested in something along those lines but neither of them is an exact fit for me.
I would like a UI where I have a navigation section to open views, either as a layout panel or buttons in the ribbon bar.  I would like the views to open as tabbed documents.
The scaffolding wizard is great for getting something up and running quickly without having to write any code, but it doesn't seem like it's set up very well for incremental extension i.e. I want to add new functionality down the road.  Also, I need to add some features that are not purely CRUD. I'm not sure how to best integrate that into the structure of the generated app.
 MIF might be a better fit because it offers a navigation view and creates the documents as tabs.  But my application is going to be fairly small so I'm wondering if MIF might be overkill.  It seems like there is a lot of configuration involved.  I was also unclear from the documentation how Entity Framework integrates into the MIF design.  I would like to use dependency injection of a context factory.
So if you needed to build a smallish (~10 views) application with a tabbed MDI interface that contains some CRUD views and some other views where no data manipulation is needed , how would you approach it using DevExpress components?  An iterative build process is necessary as all of the necessary features are not known at this time, so the application will need to be extended in the future to add more features.

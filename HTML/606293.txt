Hi,
I have Windows form application with  documentViewer control with standard bar. I change the language and  the main view language is  changed correctly, but the standard bar language is not changed.
I  attached a sample. I set the language to German and the  main view and status bar is in German but the standard bar remains in  English.
Thank you in advance.
Tommaso.

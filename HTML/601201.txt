Hi
How do I display a tooltip for a WPF grid cell?   I've looked at 
, but it references a non-existent GridColumn attributes, CellToolTipBinding and CellToolTipTemplate.  The closest existing attribute is just called ToolTip, but that unsurprisingly doesn't result in a tooltip being displayed.
Unfortunately as usual, actual working documentation and examples have been hidden by DevExpress and the implementation made needlessly complex to prevent users from using the controls without submitting support tickets.

I cannot find in the 
 a way to handle the event corresponding to clicking on the clear button in aÂ DxDropDownBoxComponent.
I have enabled showClearButton = "true".
I was looking for some kind of "(onClearButtonClicked)=myfunction($event)".
I need indeed to commit some action when the use clear the dropbox field.
Any lead ?
Thank you

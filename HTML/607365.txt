I am having trouble understanding resizing of you layout controls. I am attaching a small Winforms project in VS 2017 that has a main form set to Autosize a simple ribbon and a main xtra layout control. I am using xtra user contols(modules) to fill the main layout of the main form When I maximize or simply resize the main window, the module layout control groups do not resize as expected. Can you please assist me with this issue?

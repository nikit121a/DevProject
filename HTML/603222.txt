I have a GridControl with multiple selection performed with a CheckBoxSelectorColum. When a row is selected, a separate grid filled with details is shown
I'd like to make this grid appear  even when I am just clicking on a row, not the Check box
I still need to keep the checkbox in for selection, but would like to get the current clicked on item!
I managed to find an ugly workaround using a HitTest in code behind but would like to see if there is anything else better beforehand. Can you let me know if there is one?
Thanks

Hello Support.
I have a grid with Angular 5  having calculated cell values not related to any dataField.
The filterBuilder setup for this grid as described in your demo not works because the dataField is missing on some colums and exceptions are thrown.
Is there any way to use the filterBuilder with calculated cell values?
Thank you.
Best regards,
Alberto

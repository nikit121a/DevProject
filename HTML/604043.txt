Hi,
I found the memory leak in the application, and when I inspect leak using profiler, I found there everywhere memory leak produce a TreeList component and XtraAnimator is always a first on the root of GC.
Is it known bug in 17.1.7 version?Â 
I attach the screen from memory profiler.
Thanks
Denis

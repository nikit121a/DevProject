Good morning.
We'd like to check if a TcxRichEdit control value has changed whenever the user exits. For our TcxMemo we compare EditValue to EditingValue and that works just fine. But when we do a similar comparison for TcxRichEdit we always get a mismatch because one of the two has RTF values in it. 
We need that comparison because the OnChange function fires all the time and we need to distinguish a true change from a repainting or some other action.
Could you tell us what the proper comparison is to ascertain equality?
Thanks!

Hi,
i'm using a BootstrapPopupControl in my application that i'd like to keep in the browser window's center even if the window is resized.
Using the 
 and 
 attributes the popup can initially be brought up centered. Upon resizing the browser window, however, the popup appears to remainÂ anchored to it's absolute top-left corner. Is there any way to keep it in the center even if the window is resized?
Thx in advance!

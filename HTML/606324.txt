Hi,
I have an issue with getting the  ShowCrosshair method to point at the right date in my Swiftplot diagrams. The way I initialize the crosshairs for all the charts is by clicking on a menu button that capture the current nearest seriespoint in the selected chart (as you can see on the parameter of the method).
 After that I loop through all the charts I try to show crosshairs for them at the same date as the selected chart (currentNearestPoint.Argument).
For the Y-axis I use detectAxisY (workaround because my charts have different y-axis ranges).
In the debugger I can see the right date values go through currentNearestPoint.Argument. ButÂ  in the running GUI the crosshairs is placed on the wrong date. As can be seen in the example picture.
Test method after I click the menu menu button:
Do you know what could be wrong?
Best regards,
Sebastian

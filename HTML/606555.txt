Hi,
I am using a TreeListControl in my application and one of its main feature is to receive and display real time data. We chose this component because we need to display a hierarchical view and we like the sorting, grouping etc... We have around 200 columns.
We have around 10 columns in realtime and I noticed that every time one of these columns changed (ie we call NotifyPropertyChanged event), our grid freezes/hangs for a few second. After deep investigation, I spotted the issue, it is coming from a full refresh of the entire row:







that calls RefreshRow (through DoRefreshRow):













I created 4 classes to override some native DevExpress behaviors:










Unfortunately in Devexpress 17.1.4, I did not find a way to get what I wanted since almost all the methods are declared as protected internal.
My questions:
1/ Is it worth it to switch to a GridControl (way more optimized than TreeListControl?) in master-details to keep the hierarchical view but have better performances?
2/ What can we do to update only ONE cell by row, and not the entire row every time a field changes? It seems like a something very basic.
Please give us a quick solution that requires no dev from you.
(one solution with dev would be to be able to call UpdateData(ColumnBase column, int listSourceRowIndex) in RefreshRow)
Thank you for your help.
Best regards,

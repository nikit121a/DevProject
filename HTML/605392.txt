Hi Support,
I have a customer who connects remotely to my application using remote desktop of windows.
Remote Desktop  redirect Resource and Printer.
I have a RichEditControl on a form and I would like to print it in runtime mode.
I have a Button and on OnClick  Event I  had write :
where dxPrinter is TdxComponentPrinter
In the next Dialog I do not see the printer that are redirected by Remote Desktop of Windows.
If I use standard TPrintDialog of delphi I see my redirected printer but passing PrinterIndex to dxPrintDevice I have an error Printer Index Out of Range.
 
Can you help me ?
Thanks

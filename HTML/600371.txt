In the reception Desk schedule demo app, I'm trying to add the following action.  
From the right side list of paitents that you can drag and drop onto the schedule, I would like to double click and open the medical appointment window to schedule the selected patient manually instead of drag and drop.  
From the Table View grid: double click on a selected row > Open a new medical appointment window and pass selected patient's parameters in from selected row  to the form.  These values should be:
a. Patient name
b. patient id
c. patient phone
d. patient birthdate
(I know some values are bound in medical appointment window. So i'm not sure which of these we are passing in to window)
also, be able to set other values not included with the selected row that exist in the medical appointment window.
a. appointment type status  = value
b. payment status =  value.
c. Doctor = value (I know some values are bound in medical appointment window. So i'm not sure which of these we are passing in to window)
d.  reminder = value
e. start time = value
f. end time = value
Thank you

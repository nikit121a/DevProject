Hi guys,
I'm using the Scheduler BeginCallback as follows:
To pass some information on the callback; the command comes through fine, however in the case of "GOTODATE" I am not able to find the clientside property that tells me what date we are trying to go to; I've had a look on both the sender (s) and event (e) objects.
Please can you advise what I need to use?
Thank you,
Stan

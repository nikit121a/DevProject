Hi Team,
Can we call a webpage to be included \ loaded within a Tabpage ?
Example: 2 webpages page1.aspx and page2.aspx.
We have ASPxPageControl  in page1.aspx. Load contents of  page1.aspx in TabPage1 of ASPxPageControl and load page2.aspx in TabPage2 of ASPxPageControl.
Is this possible ? If not which control we can use for this purpose ASPxTabControl ?

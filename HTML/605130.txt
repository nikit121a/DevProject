This is a two part question but since they both revolve around disabling dates and times I think they can be asked together in the same ticket. Feel free to separate them if you think it's necessary.
How to programatically disable some dates in dxDateBox when the type is set to "date"  or "datetime". I would like to calculate some stuff and based on the result I want to disable a date. An example would be week working hours where Sunday is marked as "not working". based on this information I would want to disable all of Sundays in the calendar. Now, I know this can be achieved by filling up an array of Sundays but I want to avoid that.
This basically continues the first question but this time it is about times. So I would like to know if times can be disabled when dxDateBox type is set to "time". When I get the time picker, or whatever else I am getting depending on the theme,  I want to disable certain times so I cannot pick them at all. An example would be same as above but with accent on working hours. If a shop is opened from 08:00 in the morning untill 04:00 in the afternoon I would like all other times to be grayed out(unselectable) or not available at all. For this matter I would also like to know if min and max can work for times as well.

Hi.
I'd like to use the HTML 5 JS graph control in asp.net and generate the series programmatically.
I am currentlyÂ  using the WebChartControl, but I do not like the fact that I cannot resize it with the page.
I tried to  find a web form project using the HTML 5 JS components, but could not find one.
Do you have a sample?
thanks!

Hi,
I'm busy with the ASPxTreeList, which has filtering since 17.2.
After typing some characters in  the filterbox, the nodes are filtered correctly. But while trying to show the next page or to change the filer text, an error appears:
I've tried a lot of things, I've looked on the internet but I found nothing helping me.
Please help me!
Thanks in advance,
CorBins

Hello,
I've implemented the menu in my grid like so
Now i need item2 to produce a sublist of buttonitems (like a standard menuitem with the arrow to the right opening the menu on the right side) and bind this list to a list i have in my viewmodel. Some help with how to do that would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance

Hello!
I have the following scenario. I display a TreeList with several nodes in it.
Initially the first node in the TreeList is selected and focused. I then have the functionality in my software to jump to a certain node within the tree list which means setting sole selection and focus on that node. I do that by. 
//code
Selection.Clear();
FocusedNode = nodeToSelect;
nodeToSelect.Selected = true;
//end code
After this every thing looks fine. But when I now try to additionally select the node below the one I jumped to with "Shift + Key Down" then actually the nodes from the TopNode all the way down to the current node are selected. If I by mouse select a different node than the topnode and then to a jump to and then a shift arrow then the range between the jumped to node and the node selected by click are selected. Does this have something to do with this code I found in the TreeListHandler
if(Data.SelectionAnchor == null)
                            Data.SelectionAnchor = Data.SelectionOldCell != null ? Data.SelectionAnchor = Data.SelectionOldCell : new TreeListCell(TreeList.FocusedNode, TreeList.FocusedColumn);
                        SelectAnchorRange(new TreeListCell(node, TreeList.FocusedColumn), Data.SelectionAnchor);
This lead me to try out to modify my jump to code and just execute it twice:
//code
Selection.Clear();
FocusedNode = nodeToSelect;
nodeToSelect.Selected = true;
Selection.Clear();
FocusedNode = nodeToSelect;
nodeToSelect.Selected = true;
//end code
When I do this everything works as I want it to.

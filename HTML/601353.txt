Hi DevExpress,
We are currently using DevExpress 17.2.4.0. One of our clients have found a bug in the DevExpress XtraGrid control related to Text Filters. I was able to replicate this problem using the DevExpress 17.2 XtraGrid Demo project. 
I've attached a video to demonstrate the issue.
Steps to Reproduce
===============
1. Open DevExpress 17.2 WinForms Demo project
2. Select "Data Grid and Editors" demo 
3. Select "GDI+ Mode" 
4. Select Grid Views => "Table View" from the left navigation panel
5. Right click "Product" column and choose "Filter Mode" => "Display Text"
6.  Click Filter icon
7. Select  "Text Filters" tab
8. Click drop down and observe list of options
9. Type "Does Not B"  and observe autocomplete for "Does Not Begin With"
10. Type "Does Not E"  and observe autocomplete for "Does Not End With" 
11. Observe both criteria above can be used as filter criteria, but is not an option in the drop down
Please review and let me know if this can be resolved in a future release. 
Kind Regards,
Ken

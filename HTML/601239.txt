Hello, we've been trying the Skin Editor, but we could not figure out how it works.
After some trial and error, we've man aged to get some insight, but we're still lacking what we believe is probably some basic knowledge..
Our current objective is to change the global highlight color.
For instance: When we hover over a Large Ribbon Button, we want its background color to change to a different color than just a darkened version of its original background color.
Same goes for the checked state of Check Items in the ribbon bar and selected values in a backstage page menu
We've tried changing the Highlight Color properties under Common -> System Colors -> Highlight , but It does not seem to change anything.
We've also tried looking at Ribbon -> Buttons -> Large Button. But we cannot find a way to change the color of individual states.
If you could please give us some insight , we'd be much obliged

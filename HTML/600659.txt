Hello,
This question is a bit related to Q278657 
I have a xtragrid that gets its datasource at runtimeÂ  (different from Q278657 I believe)
I know that the datasource will have a column named "IsSelected"
I need to detect immediately when the "IsSelected" field has changed
Partial code:
It should be noted that there are more then 1 boolean fields in the datasource.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

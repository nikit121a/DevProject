Hi,
I am having issue modifying attribute to DevExtreme MVC control wrapper by using JS.
Why do I need to explicitly specify control ID in order to modify the attribute from JS?
Whenever I use "xxFor", the control ID should auto generate at HTML.
Or any other setting I need to specify on MVC wrapper?
Please enlighten me. Thanks.

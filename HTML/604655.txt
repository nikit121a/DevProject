Hello,
I did some tests with RolesMergingMode in security system and found one thing that I don't fully understand.
Let's say I want to allow members of one group read access to Person table,
but I also want to prevent members of second role read access to Name property of Person type.
I have RolesMergingMode set to GrantedInAnyRole and created 2 roles:
- Role1 - allow read access to Person Type, Permission policy set to deny all by default
- Role2 - Permission policy set to Deny all by default, No Person Type permissions, but deny on FirstName and LastName members
User 'usr1' is member of both roles.
According to ilustration in the bottom of 
 page,
I would expect that member permissions configured in Role2 would take priority over the ones in Role1, but they don't.
Please could you explain me what is expected behavior in this case?
Thank you
Radovan

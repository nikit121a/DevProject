Hi,
Please find the attached sample.
Problem found:
1) Search for a node and when the search is still in progress make the node bold.
2) You can make the node bold by applying Snoop and Searching for the property FontWeight and changing it to bold.
As i could not simulate the same in the sample, I am asking you to use Snoop and reproduce the same issue.
As a whole i need a solution where in the nodes are bold even though the Search is in progress.
Thanks and Regards,
Prajaktha

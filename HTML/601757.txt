Hello Uriah,
I tested the RolesMergingMode option. It seems to do exactly what I need except one thing - if user belongs to any role that doesn't have any permission for given type defined (even completely empty role), the access to the type is denied.
For example there are 2 roles - the first allows navigation and read permission to Person type. The second one is empty. User usr1 belongs to both roles. In this configuration, access to Person is denied.
Please see attached screenshots.
It would make more sense to me if a role that does not contain any permission for given type would be ignored for permission calculation. 
Would it be possible to change the permission processing in this way?
Otherwise, it would be necessary to grant permission to a type in all roles.
Thank you

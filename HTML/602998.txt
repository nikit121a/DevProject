I'll attached link to the video where I demonstrate the problem, in the first part of the video there is a grid view without multi selection enabled and focusing on a row works as it should, blue back color shows, but when I enable multi-select all selected rows that are checked are blue and one that are not checked are without blue color and I want both checked and unchecked to be without back color unless I focus on some row like in the first case. Can you help me with this, thank you.

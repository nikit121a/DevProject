Hello, 
I'm using Gantt view, i have a problem when scrolling, when i select an appointment, the scrolling using mouse wheel gets very slow, like if keeps focus on the appointment, so i tried to rewrite the event OnMouseWheel.
but it doesn't seem to work, i tried all 
ResourceNavigation.NavigateForward();
ResourceNavigation.NavigateLast();
ResourceNavigation.NavigatePageForward();
ResourceNavigation.NavigateBackward();
ResourceNavigation.NavigateFirst();
ResourceNavigation.NavigatePageBackward();
No success,
also i have a problem when i try to drag an appointment outside the visible zone, i don't know if it's related.
is there another approach to this, or a parameter that i should activate deactivate ?
thank you,
Kind regards,

Hi
I am trying to use the code sample 
everything works ok until I get to use the data on a pivot grid, when I find I cannot filter out an individual code, regardless of whether it includes another code as well
so the data will display and group by 
Fruit  
Fruit,Vegetables
GrainsCereals,DairyProducts etc
individually as separate entities which is ok its what you would expect , I want to be able to filter by values which contain  fruit, but if I do it doesn't include Fruit,Vegetables for example as this is a different value, the list gets rather long its a bit tedious to find all the occurrence's with word Fruit in which is what the user want to find.
not sure if the same will happen on a standard grid but I would be looking for the same behavouir
the pivot grid is populated via an XPView if that helps

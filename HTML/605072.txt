Hi DevExpress team,
I'm trying ot sync my scheduler with Google, using business object binding. The current issue is for syncing recurrent events and exceptions.
Thanks to 
, I've made quite some progress on the recurrences. However, I'm blocked in the "LinkOccurrencesWithPatterns" method, where I am currently able to create exceptions, but I then need to save the corresponding business object to the database.
I've created the following routine, where I explain the issues in comments.
Could you please advise as to how I can get the corresponding source objectÂ  for an exception appointment? Or maybe I'm taking it the wrong way?
Thanks in advance for your help!
Regards,
Nik

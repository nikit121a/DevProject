Hello DevExpress team,
Please, have a look at a screenshot.
Is it somehow possible to align some toolbar items to the left and some to the right within one toolbar?
We had till now all items aligned to the right
Now we want to add new item 'Actions' which should be aligned to the left.
As i understood, it can be done with another toolbar, but another toolbar row looks not nice. Maybe there is some nicer way to configure the toolbar?
Thank you,
Aleksandr.

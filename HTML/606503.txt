When using the Visual Studio 2013 Blue skin, the down arrow sort icon is incorrectly represented by a second filter icon.
The down arrow sort icon is shown correctly when using a different skin.
Please note that this appears to affect other skins too, such as Visual Studio 2013 Light. I'm not going to check them all, but you should.
See attached video.

Hi there,
I have a navigation pane with several tabpages.
On one of the pages is a treelist.
The treelist is populated by a datatable before the form is being shown.
As long as the treelist has not been visible in the interface = the tabpage with the treelist has not been selected, I cannot set nodes checked and AllNodesCount  = 0.
As soon as the treelist has been displayed, everything is fine, .CheckAll() works and AllNodesCount  too.
Please advise.

In our current software, when we save, we get new Ids for all of the objects being saved. We update the DBÂ  and the working memory with these, but the ActiveFilter does not get updated and is still looking for the old id after the save and thereby does not display the column to be filtered. There are many properties within the ActiveFilter that contain the old field name (ie - ActiveFilterCriteria, ActiveFilterString, FilterPanelText, etc). Is there a way, once we have the new Id, to simply make one statement that would update all of the properties to reflect?

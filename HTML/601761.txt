Hi,
I have a question for you.
I have a UserControl with a ExpandoObject DependencyProperty .
I need to create a simple template when I generate a label and textbox for any properties of my ExpandoObject. How can I do this?
This is my xaml.cs code:
    
and this is my xaml code:
the items must be recreated every time that I change the SelectedObject because the new Expando object could have other properties with other value.
Thank you

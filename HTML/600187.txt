Hello
I was wondering if there is a way to globally set a preference/default for the textoptions property of an appearance object.
Typically I like to set on a grid the row and heading settings to textoptions.trimming = none because I don't like the appearance of the ellipses, i'd rather just see it chopped off.
I do this on every single grid so wondered if there was a way to change this globally. 
I'm aware I could subclass the grid to provide some of this functionality but it just feels like a sledge hammer to crack a nut.
Is there anything like:
LookAndFeel.Default.Appearance.TextOptions = None that I could set and would affect everything?
Regards
Andrew

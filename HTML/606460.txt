Hello,
I need to show  Cascading Modal Dialog in vb.net winforms.
I have one form which have to shown say 5 times at a time with different data. (please refer attached image)
As we know , that there should be one modal dialog at a time .I tried showing modal dialog as recursively but not possible.
Please help with the possible solution.
 
Thanks in advance!!!!

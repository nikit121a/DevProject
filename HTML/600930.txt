Hello,
I am trying to create a button to allow the user to create a new report with report Wizard. It supposes to worked As follow:
- After button click event, program will check if the there is any working report
       - if no working report exist, invoke a report wizard to create new report
       - if there is one working report, ask if the user want to save the report before proceed further. 
I could achieve this with my code attached below. However, It will give me an error when I trying to review the report user print preview as below:
This report wizard invoked is different from the one invoked from build-in "Create New" here:
How could I invoke this updated report Wizard instead?
Thank you!!

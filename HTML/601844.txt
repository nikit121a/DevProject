This form is editing the 7 values for a project as you can see in the "AddSimpleFor" lines.Â  The 8th property is "ID", but I don't want to edit that, I just want to pass it to the LoadParams of the datagrid in the 8th "AddSimple" item.
Notice how I've hard-coded the ProjectID for the load params to 21.

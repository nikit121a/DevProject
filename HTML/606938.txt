I'm very nearly ready to pull the trigger on buying a subscription to DevExpress, and I'm trialing the product by converting an existing application to use the spreadsheetcontrol instead of using Excel.  There is one critical feature in Excel that I believe is missing from this control, and that's the ability to add custom number formats with characters. 
In Excel, you can format a cell to display the format  {#,##0.0 "HP"}, which take a number value like 110.00124, and formats it as 110.0 HP.  Displaying the scientific units of numbers is critical for my project, and I can't seem to get it to work.  The spreadsheet control ignores the above format, just displays an unformatted number.

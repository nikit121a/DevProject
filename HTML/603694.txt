I want to add an icon image to the tokens in my TokenBox, see attached picture for an example. I see there is the ItemImage-Url property which adds an image to the items in the dropdown list but I want to add an image to the token after the item has been selected. I was able to accomplish this by using this markup:
Notice that I was not able to set the left border width directly, I needed to set the general border width and then shrink all but the left to get it to work; I think this is a bug. Also, it would be nice if there was a more direct way to accomplish this such as adding TokenImage properties.
Thank you.

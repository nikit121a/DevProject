Hi! I've faced very strange issue with the table being incorrectly rendered when it is split over two pages.
We are using subreports to crate isolated table-like part with 
 and 
 in our reports. 
When it happens that 
 does not fit the page - then it and the page header are cut and split across two pages.
See an attached example. 
I've fond a lot of similar tickets but none of the approaches helped to solve the issue. I've tried to:
- set 
 to Smart on both root report and subreport  - as 
- set KeepTogether  to True on all tables, table rows and table cells - as 
 and 
(we have higher version so I expect that I do not need any patch)
There is also one 
, but it is a little bit old. 
While I was experimenting with this issue I found a strange case - it is not reproduced if there is some content before the subreport control (e.g. other labels). So for now I'm just adding empty label of 5px height (minimum that I was able to achieve) to avoid this. But for me this solution seems not reliable. 
Could you suggest some better way to fix this issue?

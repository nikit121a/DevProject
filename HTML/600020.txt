Hi,
I need to carry out some live testing but the app is not yet ready for production, so I need to somehow disable the automatic version checking temporarily to prevent the 111 Error message telling users to update the database.
How can I temporarily disable this check so that the DATABASE is NOT updated with a new version number when the app runs?
Also, where is this version data stored in the database?

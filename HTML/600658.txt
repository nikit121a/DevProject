SchedulerControl CommandBarStyle="Ribbon" crashes on second use if opened in it's own thread.
Please find attached an example project.  Run and press the 'Open Window' button TWICE to replicate. 
This seems to happen on all similar controls with CommandBarStyle also (Spreedsheet, Diagram etc) - may all be the same issue.

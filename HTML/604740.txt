Hello Svetlana,
is there a way to detect the exact click on the text within the href part? 
I have something like 
. And I dont want to do the action when I click on the text "- Description of the object."
Also is there a way to modify the blue color of the hyperlink by other color? I'm using Office 2016 Colorful skin in my app.
thanks in advance!!!

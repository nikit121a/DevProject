Good day.
I have an input field for integer in the range from 0 to 100 (including the ends ). I put the textedit (DevExpress.XtraEditors.TextEdit) with name "screenFrameIntervalTextEdit" on my form and set the following properties in properties window:
CausesValidation = true;
ValidateOnEnterKey = true;
Also I add the eventHandler in my source code:
screenFrameIntervalTextEdit.Validated += ScreenFrameIntervalTextEdit_Validated;
...
        private void ScreenFrameIntervalTextEdit_Validated(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            try
            {
                var a = Convert.ToInt32((sender as DevExpress.XtraEditors.TextEdit).EditValue);
            }
            catch
            {
               //????? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
            }
        }
I need you to help how to make a validation field value with the following messages:
1. "The value entered must be a number!" - if the entered value contains letters and other symbols.
2. "The value entered must be an integer!" - if the entered value is real.
3. "The value entered must be in the range from 0 to 100!" - if the entered value is outside the specified range.
Thanks in advance.

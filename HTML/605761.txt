Hi Team,
I have a use case where I need to hide  column headers (gridView1.OptionsView.ShowColumnHeaders = false), which will restrict users to resize columns. I would like to check with you is there any option to overcome this behavior?
I have attached a demo project that show this behavior, please help.
Thanks,
Hari Prasad

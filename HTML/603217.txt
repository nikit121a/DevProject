Hi,
attached find a sample and a short video.
1. open page
2. click "click me" button
3. click the + of the filter
4. close the popup
5. click "click me" button
=> there is a small overlay and the position of the popup is  changed. You can repeat closing/showing the popup until the popup is outside the viewport.
I could only reproduce this behavior with the special animation we've added to the popup.

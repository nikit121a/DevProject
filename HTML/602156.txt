Hi
When binding data to my dxChart I first simulate X- and Y-axis by binding the same given field for my datasource on both my argument and value axis.
By doing it this way, I can visualize one bar taking for my measure.
But, when I then bind a different argument (to my new datasource), my y-axis is not redrawn. Therefor, my new values will look extremely  tiny.
I believe  that this is because my value key has never changed it's name from my first binding.
I'm binding to my dxChart using normal array objects, inside of Angular (IO v5).
Any idea on what my cause this problem?
I thing this might me related to the same error as I am experiencing.

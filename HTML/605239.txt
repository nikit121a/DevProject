Hello,
I could not find a full working sample for uploading multiple files in XAF, so I'm trying on my own.
Maybe currently its not the perfect solution, but seems it works almost enough.
But I'm having problems trying to update a nested listview after the FilesUploadComplete() event is called, because it runs outside the View's callback.
Is it possible to generally update the view via client side? Call something in the current view callback manager in an easy form?
=========================
Detailed
=========================
The scenario:
- I've a DetailView for a master object, which contains a NestedListView named Attachments ( IList<Attachment> Attachments )
- now I've created a PropertyEditor (ASPxPropertyEditor, IComplexViewItem) and put it in that DetailView
- this PropertyEditor has an ASPXUploadControl with autoupload active
- on the server, I process that uploader events by saving every file to 'Attachment' domain components [DC] and add it to master collection)
- after the upload returns, the NestListView (Attachments) is not updated with the DCs created on server
I'd like to update that NestedListView so it reflects the Attachment DCs I created in the context of uploader callback.
Is it possible?
=========================
Notes
=========================
Note that I'm *not* saving the objectSpace. It is intended to user manually save at the end
Note that I'd like to handle everything inside the PropertyEditor. By creating a ViewController, for example, will just make it impossible to understand how it works in the future, because related functions are spreaded everywhere.

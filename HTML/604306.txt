Hi,
I'm unsure how to filter / sort custom types in XtraGrid.
I've attached an example of a simple grid with filtering of a custom type.
The resulting filtering is not as I expected as I assumed it would use the CompareTo method of my class to filter but it doesn't. I guess it must be simply filtering using the ToString() value.
Also, the grid won't permit column sorting.
Can you please assist?
Thanks

Hi,
I wrote this code inside the ColumnFilterChanged of the GridView control to get the filter applied from the user, so I can apply the same filter to the Chart control inside the same form.
The grid is bounded to the data source.
The user can create own filter but if he writes:
   - the value exactly as it is in the database, the filter works in both controls (grid and chart)
   - the value all in lower case or all in upper case, the filter works only into the grid
My question is if there is a way to indicate to the chart filter to ignore the case of the string.
Thanks

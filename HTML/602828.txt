Awhile back, DevExpress helped me with some code to implement incremental search inside a TcxLookupComboBox.
I wanted to avoid retyping that code, so I created a procedure that I could call in a separate .pas unit.
Inside that procedure, the Delphi inherited command does not compile, and I wonder if it is ok to leave it out or if that creates any memory or other runtime issues.
Below is the procedure code with the inherited command commented out. It compiles and seems to work ok at runtime.
Would you mind having a look and letting me know if it is ok to omit the inherit command in this case, or if not, what is a work around?  
Thanks!!

Hello,
We started using the new Binding Expression  method in the reports.
When using a parameter in the expression in combination with another string value, something goes wrong:
Example binding expression on a Label:  
 With the following result:
System.Data.DataRowView12000.jpg
instead of:
c:\Pictures\12000.jpg
Are we doing something wrong? 
 
Thanks.  
Dirk

                                This example demonstrates how to restrict the 
 navigation to display seven days, Saturday and Sunday excluded. 
To accomplish this, the project implements a custom 
 to handle the left and right arrow keys. Navigation commands execute custom methods defined in ViewModel. Commands are replaced with methods using the 
property and 
 binding introduced in the DevExpress MVVM Framework . 
A custom set of days is assigned to the 
 property. 
The project handles theÂ 
 event to adjust visible dates if a view's visible intervals are changed with a method other than the navigation commands.

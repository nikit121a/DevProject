Hi,
I want to navigate in my application (by a ViewModel Command)  when i click on a link or a button inÂ AppointmentContentPanel. I started a DataTemplate but I really have no idea how to insert a button or a link. This one will have to trigger a viewModel command.
Since I did not succeed, I tried to trigger this command on the CustomAllowAppointmentEdit event. But that's not really what I wanted.
regards,

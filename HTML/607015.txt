Hi,
Colors of the bar and the legend item are different when  we apply a customized color for that particular bar in the chart. In this case the customized color is displayed in the bar and the palette color is shown in the legend. I edited your demo as follows. 
The out put is given in the attachment. You can see that the legend item color and the chart color is different in the output.

In desktop dashboard designer using Devex 17.2.5, in a grid with hyperlinks, if you conditionally format the hyperlink column and color the background, you must attach the formatting rule to the URI column and not the display value column so the formatting will be seen in the web viewer once published.  **This will cause the formatting to be blank in the designer, but it will show on the web. The opposite is true if you attach the rule to the Display Value - the formatting will show in the desktop designer but not online.

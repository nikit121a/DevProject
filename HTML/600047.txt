Hi, 
iam trying to change color of work time cells to darker. i found any solution, but it doesnt work for me. 
In first step, i create resources like that 
And as is found, in next step i change ResourceColorSchme
 But nothing happends. Work times are still colored by default "darker" color, derived from color which i set  ( resource.Color = color;) 
Can you help me please ? 
Thanks Ale?

Hello.
Yesterday I experienced this confusing experience, a combolookupedit, which no longer activated its behavior of change of value! As I have just resolved this situation, I want to share the cause of this situation that I find strange.
I use a repository lookupedit to fill a full-time, column from a large list of value, however, when you need to make an entry, the list of values   is less. So I use CustomNodeCellEdit mecanism, to determine the display repository (wide list), CustomNodeCellEditForEditing to specify, according to the type of line, the appropriate lookupedit, with the appropriate data (reduced list).
As I manage data rights, I consider the author of the information, and the user currently logged in, for or against the change. And I thought it was enough that the management of the readonly is only dedicated to the editing repository! But after research on this blocking behavior, where no modification is possible, I can say, that this is not the case.

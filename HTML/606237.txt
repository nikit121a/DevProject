Hello,
I have a RibbonForm with the properties RibbonStyle = MacOffice and RightToLeft = Yes
I Added buttons to the quickaccess toolbar to be at the top-right corner, and I realize that the SuperTips are aligned to the right, and I want them left aligned as I can see always in normal ribbon configurations.
Please, find attached and image with the result I can see. Even the final dot at the end of my tooltip at design time is shown in the left side.
Could you help me to configure them to see them left aligned?
Thanks!!!

Hello DevExpress,
Is there any chance there are any additional articles or resources out there on using the KPI module besides this 
I've been trying to get my head wrapped around it.
I am under the impression that if we set the 
  to a value of week we would get a KPI measuring current week to previous week as well as get a spark line of the measure as a function of time. But it seems i am unable to get this field is to do anything. 
The only way i can get results is to use  Range, compare box, and Range to Compare. I would like to get something on the order of take the last 7 days sum and compare it to the 7 previous days before that. To get something on the order of this I would need to be able to define custom Rage parameters. Can you create custom ranges within the Range and Compare To Range fields.
 Also the Range and compare to Range fields seem to have an option for "Rolling" as depicted in the Concepts/Extra-Modules/KPI documentation. there appears to not be that option when I try.
There is something that is not clicking and hope you could point me to some additional resources on how to correctly use the KPI module.

Hello XAF-Team,
I would like to ask you, what is the suggested way to solve the following request: 
I have a Contact class plus ContactGroup and EmailInet.
ContactGroups are linked to Contacts in n-m manner .
EmailInet is an aggregated property of Contact.
Contact has a Modified property. 
How can I achive, that Modified property is set every time a user links a contactgroup or adds/changes something in EmailInet property?
Please check out the attached sample.
thanks
Reinhold

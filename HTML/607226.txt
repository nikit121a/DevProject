Hello
from your example treeListDemo\dynamicNodeLoading, I just set the Theme to TouchlineDark
when I use a Microsoft Surface in touch mode:
- it's very hard to open a directory node (with double touch down)
- it's quite difficult to select a node (also double click)
I would like to modify the way this control is working:
when user touch a node, the node must be selected or be expanded.
So I need to add code inside TouchDown event.
here is my problem:
I need to get a TreeListNode from the event
and i don't succeed.
  



Do you have a solution?
Best Regards
Philippe

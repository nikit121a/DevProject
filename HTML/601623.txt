Hello,
I have a question about the Office 2016 Colorful skin.
I hav ea project where I use components from a different vendor.
In there skin the backcolor of Office 2016 is white.
There I want to haveÂ Office 2016 Colorful skin with a white backcolor.
All backgrounds of Windows, panels etc which are light grey at the moment should be white.
What is the easiest way to achieve this?

Hi, I am trying to create a button that uses the @ string to do localization. Here is the problem:
1) HTML Binding Works
This button will correctly put the text associated with the billTotal  language entry into the text of the button, in a default button and the onClick works.
2) Knockout Biding Does Not Work
with javascript of:
This button displays the string @billTotal as the text of the button, in a default button and the onClick works.
I don't want to have to embed all of my binding objects into the HTML, this seems like a bug in the system in some way. Any explanation you can give me would be appreciated.

I am trying to iterate through all of the layout control groups in my form, and duplicate the structure on an accordion control. The idea being, that when someone clicks on the accordion control, the cursor is then taken directly to the layout control group in question, and the first control INSIDE is selected. I have it ALMOST working based on other articles here using the following code:
The problem is, the point of using an accordion control is that I want to duplicate the parent\child relationship of the layout control groups. Often times there are layout control groups INSIDE other layout control groups (hence the recursive nature of the code above). 
1. Under  "AddToNavBar" I want to first check if this LayoutControlGroup HAS a parent, in which case I'll add it as an item UNDER it's parent. I also want to check to see if it has any children that are also layoutcontrolgroups. If it does, I'll add them as GROUPS, if not, as ELEMENTS.
2. I'd also like to know, when clicking on these codes, how can I LOCATE and SELECT the layoutcontrolgroup in question?

Hello Team,
We use richtext editor mvc extension to open docx files.
When I click into table,, by default it shows design and layout tabs. I would like to keep those tabs, but do not want to give my users all the formatting options in the design/layout tabs.
For example, I want to hide table styles. In borders & shading show only borders but remove shading s options.
Please let me know how can I achieve this. 
Thanks for your time.

I have the following hierarchy of controls:  XtraEditors.PanelControl > XtraEditors.LabelControl.  The LabelControl is used to display a message of Success, Warning or Error.
We displayed a success message in green, a warning in yellow and an error in red.  This worked fine until users started changing the theme of the application.  For example, a yellow warning  is fine in the "Office 2010 Black" theme but unreadable in the "Seven Classic" theme.
How can we adequately color the messages to support every theme?  Ideally this solution would also support future themes that do not currently exist.
Should we remove the ability to change themes and force every user to use the same theme?

The attached example project is based on the sample that Alexey provided here :-
Specifically, I am trying to implement  a MultilineComboBoxEdit component which will allows for any number of lines to be displayed in the EDIT box, but also for 
items to be allowed (and drawn correctly) in the dropdown list too.
To achieve this, I  override the 
 method, and hook in to the 
 event.
As you'll see when you run the sample code however, the event never gets fired.
Please can you tell me if this is a bug or am I doing something wrong?

In my MVC Application I log in as one customer as the OLAP pivot grid works fine but when i log in as another customer it locks up and doesn't load. 
The work around for this is clearing the browser cache but I need something cleaner.
When I'm loading the pivot grid is there a clear cache or reset state command or reset command i can use use just after instantiating the grid that i can use to prevent this from happening.??Â

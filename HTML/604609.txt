                                This example illustrates approaches to set the color of a time cell in a scheduler grouped by resource.
1. Each resource can have its own color specified by the 
 property. Uncomment two lines in the MainWindow's XAML to assign the resource color mapping, so that each resource obtains its color from the data source.
2. Use a custom resource brush schema. Create a 
 object in MainWindow's XAML resources and assign it to the  
 property.
3. Create a 
's data template, define a cell style and assign the style to the appropriate property of the desired view:
- Day view, Work-Week view, Week view - use the 
 and 
 properties;
- Month view - use the 
 property;
- Timeline view - use the 
 property.
The picture below demonstrates a custom cell style and template applied to the selected cells of the resource with ID=1.  A custom data template displays the time interval contained in the cell's data context.

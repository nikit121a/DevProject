I am applying conditional formatting to the rows in the dropdown list in this event:
MyRepositoryItemGridLookUpEdit.
 But if the user types a few letters 
 dropping the list down, a subset of the full list appears, which lacks the conditional formatting. What is the proper event to apply the conditional formatting in that situation?
Thanks

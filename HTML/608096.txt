Hi.
I have several GV:s where I have  comboboxfields. The comboboxes are filled with items from a SQL-datasource.
This works exellent.
But now I have the same situation with one difference: The combobox items are filled from a SQL-datasource that is connected to another database than the datasource for the gridview.
I also works but the value instead of the text is shown  in this field in grid collapsed mode and also in edit mode.
The combobox shows the list of texts, selection is possible and the right value is stored.
But it will always display the value and not the text.
This only happens in this situation, with the items coming fron another database.
I have checked and double checked the settings and they are similar to tha other cases when this works ok.
Especially the VaueType is checked (both Value and Text are strings in this case)
Is the different database the problem here?

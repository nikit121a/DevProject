Hello, 
Your solution still works, but not with the new DirectX Support from 17.2.
The repository is painted as enabled but has no function, same it's disabled.
I have attached the modified project with the WindowsFormsSettings.ForceDirectXPaint();
Would be very nice if you can help me. Without DirectX it works same as before.
Thank you in advance
Steven

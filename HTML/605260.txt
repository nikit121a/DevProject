Hi guys,
I have a column in a GridControl of Type TimeSpan.  If it is 00:00:00, I want it to display "Blue" and the font to be 
Bold.  How do I do that.  
I tried this and it does not seem to work.
<dxg:FormatCondition ApplyToRow="False" Expression="[Duration]==00:00:00">
                            <dxg:Format Foreground="Blue" FontWeight="SemiBold"/>
                        </dxg:FormatCondition> 
Am I doing something wrong?

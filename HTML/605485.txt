Dear Team , 
I need to Capture if there is any changes happend inside the AspxHTMLEditor after page load. To brief my need,
1) Im using AspxHTMLEditor control.
2) On page load of aspx page it will load some content 
3) On a save button click i just want to know whether any changes happend inside the control. I dont even want to know what has changed, i just want ti know a true , false statement . 
4) If any change happened return true , if not return false.
Kindly do the needful.
Thank you Team. 
Regards,
Vijay

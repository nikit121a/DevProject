Hello!
Speaking about 
, it allows to implement painters for items and groups to customize drawing text, captions and so on. It is clear how to do so for GalleryControl, but not for 
. 
Attached application is an example that illustrates a custom painting for 
(at the center of the form) and displays red line that separates items from group caption. How to implement a custom paint for 
?
Thank you in advance!

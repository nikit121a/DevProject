Hi,
Winforms 
RichEditControl
Html Document
I have a list of messages and next to each it is marked(bullet) that this message is new.
I need to remove bullet after a certian time of the message,that the user has seen
and do not removeÂ  the bullet of message, which user did not see before
(it's inside the scroll bar)
How can I do that?
Thanks

Hi,
Once the column width is expanded by double clicking it, the column width can not be reduced back to its original width. A second double on the expanded column causes the width to exceed the width of the displayed grid.
I have attached and a screen capture. I will include my sample project in the next comment.
Thanks,
Mike

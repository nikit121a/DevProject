Hi,
All my customer facing the gridview performance degrade badly compare to using version 16.1.8
There's no changes in source but just update the component version.
Basically the operation is like this, every row input in grid, it will recalculate it's binded datatable (converted to dataview)  for every row again to get the correct result.
The performance degrade of adding each row in gridview was significant after 10 rows being added.
Regards,
Kenny

Hello,
I use 2 date edit in Date Range mode like your demo (
)
With the MinDayCount = 1:
1. I delete the start date text.
2. I delete the end date text.
3. I type with my keyboard a new start date.
4. I type the "tabulator" key => End date edit is selected.
The end date edit text is filled. It's the normal behavior.
With the MinDayCount = 0:
1. I delete the start date text.
2. I delete the end date text.Â 
3. I type with my keyboard a new start date.
4. I type the "tabulator" key => End date edit is selected.
Why the end date edit keeps empty ?
Is it possible to keep the same behavior as the first example? 
Best regards
Vincent

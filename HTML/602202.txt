I've seen other people ask this question and the response is usually to modify theÂ PropertyGridControl.DefaultEditors in order to associate different editors with certain data types. However, this isn't a solution in my case.
My object will have a variety of string type properties, some will need to invoke the folder browser dialogue, others will be simple text editors.
How else can I configure this?

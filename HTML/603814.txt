Hi,
I'm trying to create a custom BarStaticItem-class. I tried to follow the example shown in ticket 
Attached you find the modified example project. Basically, I copied the MyBarButton code and changed the names to "BarStaticTimerItem[...]". My Problem is, that the MyBarButton-item shows up in the context menu of the ExtendedBarManager's add command, but my newly added BarStaticTimerItem does not.
Could you kindly check the code an tell me, where the problem is?
Thanks,
Sascha

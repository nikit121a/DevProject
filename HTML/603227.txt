Hello,
We are using the MVC component UploadControl and are not setting the AllowedFIleExtensions.  It was discovered recently this this configuration allows files without extensions such as "TestFile" (vs "TestFile.txt").  
Do we need to set the AllowedFileExtensions in order to prevent this scenario?
Thank you

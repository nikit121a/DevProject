Hi,
I need some help in setting up a new app. I have spent a long time trying various controls, panels, and spilt containers and panels and it always ends up messy when the window is resized or maximized etc. 
Please take a look at the attachment which indicates what I am trying to achieve. I am generally aiming for a tabbed interface but the content of each tab must contain it's own nav bar and content area and it should all adapt reasonably to resizing. 
The only element that would be a fixed size is the control labelled 'XtraTab'. Note that the controls in the area to the right of the NavBar changes when NavBar items are selected. So I presume a user control needs to be used for that area (where XtraTab / Accordion control etc are located).
If my notes or the attached  pic is confusing let me know.
Thanks - Gerard

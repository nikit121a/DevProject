Hi,
I need the spreadsheet to be displayed without the "headers" a typical spreadsheet has (0/1/2 and A/B/C) and have set ShowColumnHeaders="False" ShowRowHeaders="False".
Nevertheless, I need the columns to be resizable with mouse by dragging them on the divider line between the single columns.
In principle, it is the same requirement as somebody requested already for winforms grid, See 
.
1. Am i right this will not work out of box ?
2. An approach could be to manually intercept mouse-events (mouse move and click) and implement manually.
However, I am not able to determine if I am "on or next to a" column boundary. Consider the following snippet:
How can I get the screen position of a cell (Not logical like "A2", but current view pixels,e.g. relative to control scroll range start, like (Rect Left=20, Top=20, Width=200; Heigh=10). Or - even better - for a column ?
Goal is to calculate the distance to column border this way (If next to it, change mouse cursor).
This should also work e.g. when scrolling, so just sum up columns PixelWidth is no alternative.
3. Any other idea how to achieve this - > is important for further usage of control.
Thank you for your feedback,
Daniel

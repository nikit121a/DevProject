I want to use the group summary of the GridControl to update data in the group rows. To do so I used a custom summary and the GroupSummaryItemTemplate of the TableView of my GridControl. In the CustomSummary event I created my own type I placed it in the TotalValue of the CustomSummaryEventArgs object with the data I need to feed the combobox. In the template I display the combobox and bind the ItemsSource and SelectedItem with my data I found in the Value property of the GridGroupSummaryData. Then I use the SelectionChange event of my ComboBox to update the rows of the group. So far everything is working well except my combobox is not aligned with my column.
So to align my combobox I put the GroupSummaryDisplayMode property to AlignByColumns and used the GroupColumnSummaryItemTemplate instead of the GroupSummaryItemTemplate. But I don't retrieve my own object in the Value property of GridGroupSummaryColumnData. The binding don't work and I have errors "System.Windows.Data Error: 40 : BindingExpression path error: 'CountriesList' property not found on 'object' ''String' (HashCode=757602046)'. BindingExpression:Path=Value.CountriesList; DataItem='GridGroupSummaryColumnData' (HashCode=1344915); target element is 'ComboBox' (Name=''); target property is 'ItemsSource' (type 'IEnumerable')" on the output window of VS. I think it's a bug because I don't understand why the Value property is a string instead of me own class like in the GridGroupSummaryData class.
I did a sample application so you can see the problem. when you start the application you have just to group a column ("married" column is a good candidate) to see the combobox and the binding errors. To see a fonctionnal version of what I want to do you can remove the GroupSummaryDisplayMode property and replace GroupColumnSummaryItemTemplate by GroupSummaryItemTemplate in the xaml file.
In subsidiary question is there a way to retreive the group rows from the GridGroupSummaryColumnData or GridGroupSummaryData class ? If so, can you give me a code snippet or point to the documentation to do so.

Hi,
We want to save reports' layout by application that uses devexpress 15.2 and open it with another application that uses devexpress 10.1.
In order to implement this we want to alllow the user the option to save the report as lower version(10.1), do you have this capability?
The reason we need this is because the users want to utilize the SUM function in the report designer (Expression Builder) which is not available in 10.1.
Alternatively,  is there another way to implement the SUM function so that it will work on 10.1 too?
Thanks,
Hadassa K.

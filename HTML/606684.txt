Hi,
new surprise this morning, I was editing the xafml and when I saved it I had this warning telling me that there are unused nodes.
I checked it and noticed that an entire object and its view have disappeared.
All my business objects are in one library, except 2 of them which are in the Module project, under the folder BusinessObjects .
Those 2 are not detected/referenced anymore neither in the xafml , neither in the Module.cs !
If I leave it like this and run the application, then the related pages are not working anymore.
If I put back the removed xaml in place, it works again.
What can I do about this?  Please help, it's urgent

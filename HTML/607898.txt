We've got this code fragment that's compiling under D7, but under DX10.2.2 Tokyo, it's throwing an error saying RecordIndex is not decleared.
Either it has been renamed or moved under another object. 
Can you tell me how to fix this?
  if AItem is TcxSchedulerReportEventCell then
    AItem.Data := TcxSchedulerReportEventCellAccess(AItem).Event.RecordIndex
  else
    AItem.Data := -1;

I have a case where when I click on the delete link on the Dev ExtremeÂ  Angular (4.x) data grid row, I need to make a database call and if that database call returns a row, I need show a "Information" pop up with a custom message and "OK" button (OK is the only button pop up should have) and clicking on this will just close the pop up (no changes to the grid in this case). 
If the database call does not return a row, then I need to show the delete confirmation pop up with a custom message and a "Yes" and "No" button. When "Yes" is clicked, I need to delete the row in the database and the grid. If "No" is clicked, do not delete data in database and do not delete the row in the grid. Just close the popup. Please advise how this can be achieved.

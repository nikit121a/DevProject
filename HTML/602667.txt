I have several projects that reference the DevExpress libraries for XtraReport. When I upgrade one of the projects from version 17.1 to 17.2, and then try to open the report designer, I get a version conflict error (see attached). It tries to load the components for version 17.1 instead of 17.2. Sometimes, when I close and reopen Visual Studio, the error is gone, but then the project with the old version has this problem. Also, I noticed that the licence file under Properties is now suddenly empty. Not sure if that's relevant. Any ideas why I see these problems with version 17.x?
Thanks for your help.

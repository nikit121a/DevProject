Hello
I have a question to the XtraScheduler-control for WinForms-applications:
I must Change my Scheduler-Application to write data in a History- Table for appointments-changes. If a date or time is changed, the previous data state should be archived from the appointment.
Manual changes in the appointment-form, and also drag/drop-changes from an appointment in the Scheduler.
Is it po ssible to get the original-values from an appointment in the "SchedulerStorage_AppointmentChanging"-Event or the "SchedulerStorage_AppointmentsChanged"-Event?
Please, have you a clue for my question - how I could best solve this.
Many thanks in advance for your help && best regards,
Michael

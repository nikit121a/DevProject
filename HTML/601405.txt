I am currently using this datagrid as a drill through chart. I would like to display what filter is being applied and let the user clear that filter if they would like. 
I am calling the filter with this code 
But it is currently applying the filter and won't display that to the user. It also removes other data that isn't included in the filter. 
How can I make it behave the same as if the user were to type a filter in the filter row?

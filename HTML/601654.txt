Hello,
I created an XAF Application storing data in a Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Database. One field of a XPObject is edited by a custom property editor handling RichEditUserControl. 
When i load big Documents(28MB) into the richtext editor in Windows version and try to save this the programm is running out of memory.
Is there any way to solve this problem?
I attached a sample project for this error. SQL Server name and password are removed in App.config for Win and in the connectionhelper so you have to add this first for testing.
Looking forward to your reply!

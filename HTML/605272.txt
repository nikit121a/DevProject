hi,
when i working with xaf workflow,it's ok to importÂ  dll of a xaf module to workflow when wofkflow activity definetion. but , for a general dll, (not xaf module), i can not find the dll, even though i reference it in the project.
is there anything i have to do before import?
Thanks,
Michael Jiang

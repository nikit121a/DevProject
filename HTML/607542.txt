Hi,
I have requirement to implement a context menu to GridControl which has some MenuItems.
User should be able to select multiple menuitems as shown in the attached snap.
Please let me know how to go about implementing the same.
I am creating BarSubItem and adding it to TableViews RowCellCustomizations.
Thanks,
Vivek

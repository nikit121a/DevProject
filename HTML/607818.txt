Hello there,
See in 
 the difference between my software and DevEx demo control.
1, the 
is like a ruler that has the small and big lines in the demo, mine doesn't!
2,  when the 
are pressed in the demo the tool tip will show up, mine doesn't!
    Also, how to make the 
lil bigger?
3, how can I customize the 
to be like the demo? a circle!
4, the 
has 
(0,10,15,20,25,.....), but mine doesn't?
5, how can I customize the 
text?
6, how can I customize the 
 text?
Thanks.

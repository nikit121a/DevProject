Hi
i need to programatically load an excel file (xlsx), iterate through all rows to get the value of each column(by specifying column names).
i would like to do that without having any spredsheet control on my form (i dont need to show the content of the excel file in my app).
can i do it using devexpress components?
Can you please help by providingÂ a sample code  please (vb.net)?
thanks much in advance

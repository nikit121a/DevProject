Hi,
As you see in the attached file the adding mechanism has a very critical issue.
I have reproduced this issue 
.
1. Group by a coulmn.
2. Scroll down and select a row.
3. "Add new row"
=> It will perform an "Edit" on another row so that this row will be overwritten! The new row will be added to the grid without values (please take a look at the last row)!
Please fix this problem asap to avoid confusion.

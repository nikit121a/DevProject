Hello
I already use the tecnique visible 
 to  customize the new activion item list but in some view I would like to hide the drop-down action button and to have multiple "Add" buttons, one for each item of the new action item list.
It is possible to achieve this result with some settings of the XAF controller?
Thanks
G

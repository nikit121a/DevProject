Hello Support Team,
I am working with Jquery wrapper. 
I have used checkbox dxList .
Now, I want dataSource of my list.
So , I used below code to get dataSource in string array format. 
But in output it returns something different object. Which I attached  below in format of screenshot.
Please give me some suggestions or demo project.
Thanks, 
Vishal M. Bakhtani

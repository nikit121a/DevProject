I have a grid control with SelectionMode = Cell.
I want to know if the user has selected a bunch of cells or rows.  It will impact the behavior of the delete button.
When cells are selected, delete will clear the cell value.  When rows are selected, delete will remove the rows.
Please let me know how I can achieve this.
thanks

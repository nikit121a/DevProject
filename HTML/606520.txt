I have been tasked with moving all of my current solutions to a TFS server managed by a department in another country.  I have no administrative rights and I am the only one using this version of Devexpress so I cannot have it installed on the TFS Server.  I have been through your knowledge base and every where else as well and cant seem to find a solution to this.  The build server is complaining that it cannot find your .DLL files.

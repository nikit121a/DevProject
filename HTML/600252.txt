Hi Guys, First i wanna congratulate for this great tool!
Im having some issues trying to accomplish a smooth ajax refresh to the Grid, what should be simple task, but maybe im going on the wrong way.
Im developing a website where  i have 2 grids, that are updated every 5 seconds, and the first grid row selection is what filter the second one.
The first one is done using StaticJson and its working fine.
The problem is with the second...  That i need to update my SourceUrl, with row selecion parameters and ask for a grid refresh....
Im able to do that using CustomDataSource, like this:
and them setting option:dataSource to force the grid refresh...
It seems to work, but the grid refresh is not an Ajax refresh.... It blinks the hole grid during the update...
Maybe the grid does not kown the key, and is not doing an ajax refresh ?
Ou maybe there is another way to do that ?
Thanks in advance.

Hello,
How can i fill dataset that are already created in sqlDatasource ?
My scenario is like this.
I have created one Data-Source that contains two result set one result set is bind with report data and second result set i want to used in report BeforePrintÂ event. (refer screenshot dev1.png)
But i have problem that how can i fill or bind my second result set to other dataset that i have manually created in event of before print. I don't know how to fill my second result set with other dataset.
I am not using any detail report. 
i have just one simple report there is no complication.
Please refer screenshots
Please provide your suggestion.
Thanks,

Hi everybody.
 I am using devExtreme with Angular 5.
Works great!
But I do concern a little tabout the bundle size after building for production using the the command:
I have tried to be carefull with the imports and not to write sth like "import.. from 'devextreme-angular'.
Instead i tried to import to the lowest level e.g:
..
import { DxPieChartModule } from 'devextreme-angular/ui/pie-chart';
import { DxTabsModule } from 'devextreme-angular/ui/tabs';
import { DxRadioGroupModule } from 'devextreme-angular/ui/radio-group';
import { WsHorizontalTimelineComponent } from './ws-horizontal-timeline/ws-horizontal-timeline.component';
--Â 
But the webpack analyszer shows me that the js-Script source ist still huge.
It seems like devExtreme always loads the hole js-files.
(you can see it on the left side of the attached image, 2.64MB).
Is there any way to reduce the bundle for the devExtreme components size further?
Thank you!

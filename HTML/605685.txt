Hello, whenever I expand my tree nodes theres a chance the comboboxedit column gets changed. Is there any reason this might be happening? 
This is the template I have for it, the adjustment modes is a list of strings and the selectedItem is a string. It keeps trying to set the selectedItem to null when I expand the list which I put a null check for, but it still overwrites it without hitting the setter. 
Also tried hard coding the value  to "TEST"  in the NodeExpanded event but some of the values are still being overwritten, most of the comboboxEdits do have "TEST" though.

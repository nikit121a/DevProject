Hi, Devexpress Supports:
 Interesting thing,  I find out when I 4 threads created by below:  
Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(New WaitCallback(AddressOf iDeviceConnection), xdevice)
these threads will continuously loop ...
then when load a image from a file, using pcitureedit.loadaysn , it will not work, 
all other components such textbox , grid could be loaded succefully..

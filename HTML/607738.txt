Hi
Xamarin.Forms, XAML and Visual Studio 2017
I'm not sure if it is something related  to CodeRush or related to Visual Studio.
Until now, when I was inserting a control (like a button) in the xaml file and added an event then automatically when I was pressing the '=" (equal sign) I was prompted to press the ENTER (if I'm not mistaken) to introduce the event handler in the code behind.
Now, after some updates (Visual Studio and Code Rush) I don;t see that prompt any more, I'm just left with a code line like the following
How can I correct this and get back to the status where I was prompted to create the event handler in the code behind?
Regards
Dimitris

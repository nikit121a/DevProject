Hi
I have a large Data Grid that seems to hit some kind of limitation on the API side when grouping in several levelsÂ 
~ 25 columns, grouping in 3 or 4 levels.
Depending on amount of data rows, returns 404 Not found from the API.
It looks like  there is some kind of limitation that DataSourceLoadOptions loadOptions can handle?

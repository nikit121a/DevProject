Hello everybody,
I just noticed that filters in on detail report affect charts in a second, separate detail report. In essence, I did the following:
1. Create a new report (the data source consist of a list and the list elements contain another list)
2. Add a detail report
3. Add a nested detail report for for the inner list
4. Define a filter for the nested detail report
5. On the top level, add a second detail report
6. Add a chart to the second detail report which has the inner list as data
Expected result: the chart contains all data as it is located in a completely separate DetailReport
Actual result: the data for the chart is filtered according to the filter defined in the nested DetailReport
I have attached my sample code and a short video which shows how to reproduce the issue. Is this expected behavior? Thank you for your help.
Best regards,
Christopher

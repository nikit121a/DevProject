This issue is related to T600913.  After getting the Link and Unlink actions working it became apparent that the DataSourceProperty for the Skills collection in the master object was not being respected.  The lookup list displayed by the Link action was not applying the expected criteria to limit the list of choices.
In the sample program (attached) skills can be associated with employment records via a many-to-many relationship.  A DataSourceProperty attribute is defined to limit the choices to those skills owned by the employer. This is to prevent skills from IBM's catalog to be assigned to a Microsoft employee (and vice versa).  The filtering works as expected when the Link action is invoked from the nested list view. 
However, no filtering occurs when the Link action is invoked as follows.  As a result the user could easily link skills from the wrong employer.

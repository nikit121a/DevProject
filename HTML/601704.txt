I have several reports designed with XtraReports suite compiled into a DLL/class library.  I also have a WPF client app where the reports are generated based on user input.  The one problem I have is this.
One report is designed for landscape orientation/layout.  Here is some of the autogenerated code in the InitializeComponent section:
The problem is this.  When I generate this report and display the report in a DocumentPreviewControl, the report is initialize setup for Portrait mode.  Shouldn't this automatically display in Landscape mode?
Thanks

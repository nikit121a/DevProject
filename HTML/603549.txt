Hi,
i've got a DXTabControl with dynamically adds DXTabItems.
The View property is declared as following:
The method for adding a DXTabItem is:
In XAML I created a command binding, which directs to a method CloseTabCmd_Executed:
The methods signature looks like the following:
Until this point everything works as expected. I set a breakpoint inside the executed method and debugger stops inside the method.
If I'm going to inspect the ExecutedRoutedEventArgs with the built in tools in VS the Source object differs from the one I clicked before.
For example if there are two Tabs and I'm going to click the first one, the second Tab will be the Source of the event (and vice versa).
Am I doing any mistakes while using the .CloseCommand property together with View's property RemoveTabsOnHiding?
Or is this maybe a known bug?
Thanks in advance!
EDIT: Updated method CreateNewTabItem()

I am using POCO MVVM pattern. The taks is: to save whole ViewModel current state as a xml file and reuse (after restart)
Here is save method inside using this.GetType --  which returns (because of POCO i think) MainWindowViewModel_4240dffc_6386_4572_bf72_2d11708b458f 
 As you see MainWindowViewModel has GUID at the end at runtime, and it is changing on each run. 
When try read back by this method it gives error because type is different even if I'm using MainWindowViewModel as type also
 
When im trying to serialize for save via  `typeof(MainWindowViewModel)` type it gives an error:
What is the solution you suggest

Hi,
I pass image into  XtraReport via Parameters properties
When I try to edit report in WPF report designer, image is not visible (in design and in print preview). If I show report in DocumentPreviewWindow then image is visible.
What I must to make that image will be visible in WPF designer?
Regards,
Kruno

Hello!
I have an application with many grid controls and I would like to leverage a resource dictionary so that I only have to define items once.
I've been able to bind the ColumnsSource  to an array of grid columns, which is great.
I'm not able to achieve the same thing for the row-level context menu items.
 Here is my XAML code for one of the grids:
How do I reference barbuttonitems in a resource dictionary from XAML?
Thanks!

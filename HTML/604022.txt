Hi
I want to add a column with the dataField Property to my grid .
This works fine for all of my firlds in my class.
But unfortunately  it does not work with my getter in my class.
Example:export class Personal {

This works fine:
This is not working
How can I archive this?
I do not want to go with "calculateCellValue" or template, because otherwise I have to implement all callbacks like "calculateFilterExpression" etc.
Thanks for help

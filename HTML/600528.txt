We want custom repositories on every day of the scheduler i.e. we want a calendar view in which there are tasks and sub-tasks and there should be master checkboxes to mark all tasks as 'Done' on day/week/month/year level. Checking a master checkbox would mean that a task has been marked 'Done' for the whole day/week/month. For example, there is a task named "Drink Water". This will repeat on daily basis on the scheduler for (say) a month or maybe a year. We should be able to mark it as 'Done' on day level which would mean that the task has been done for all times for that specific day and their should also be checkboxes to mark it as 'Done' on weekly/monthly/yearly level i.e. only one checkbox can mark it as 'Done for the whole Year'.
As shown in the attached screen, there were 2 tasks scheduler on Tuesday 11th. There is a checkbox at the day level, checking it would mean that all tasks for that day have been performed. If we go inside the day, there are two tasks namely "Drink Water" and "Feed The Cat" which are due twice a day. Checking each task would mean that the task has been performed for 'Morning' and 'Evening'. In the next tier, there are sub-tasks namely "Morning" and "Evening". Checking both of them would thereby mean that all the sub-tasks of the parent task has been performed. 
Kindly look into this on priority and get back to us ASAP. We are working on a very critical and urgent project.Â

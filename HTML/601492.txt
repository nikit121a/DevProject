hi support team,
I'm applying the dxFilterBuilder control to my MVC project.
It worked perfect until I got the trouble when getting its filter string.
It looks like this:  ["CustomerID", "contains", "DEF"],
["WarehouseID", "contains", "ABC"]
How could I parse this condition string so that SQL can understand?
Please advise.
Thanks.

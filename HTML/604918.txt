Hello,
I attached a sample project.  
In this project when I select an item from DataGrid, PivotItems property is updating. Pivot is bound to PivotItems, so I expect to see some items on Pivot, but nothing happens.
Items are only updating when I left click and select "Reload Data".
How can I solve this problem?

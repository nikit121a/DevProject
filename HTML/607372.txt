This was a strange on to find but here is the scenario.
I have a number of bootstrapbuttons styled with css to just show font awesome icons.
When I have these inside an update panel the button doesn't fire
When I add text to the button and the cursor is over the text when the button is clicked it fires, if it is over the icon it doesn't fire.
code as below as a demo shows the issue
It is important I get this issue corrected. Please can you help
Regards
Liam

Hi support,
I have 2 tables (2 objects). How to insert a value property for two tables.
My table structure :
ProjectActivities
=================
NameActivity
DateOfActivity
ActivityType
VWorkDay
=======
DateOfActivity
ActivityType
WorkDay
I want to insert DateOfActivity & ActivityType to ProjectActivities and also insert them to VWorkDay. Any reference for this? I was looking for the ticket from others, but not really appropriate for my scenario.
Thank you.

I want to use a custom message when deleting a row in a grid and followed the steps in 
. This requires that I replace the  GridViewToolbarCommand.Delete button with a GridViewToolbarCommand.Custom button. 
To keep the look of the toolbar buttons consistent I want to use the same icon for my custom button as is used by the Delete button. 
Is there a way to set the icon  to the same icon as used by GridViewToolbarCommand.Delete?

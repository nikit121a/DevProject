Hi,
I have configured some reports for a client of ours.
These reports use an SQL data source with 2 Stored Procedures that return the necessary data.
The stored procedures that do not use parameters work fine.
The other stored procedures  that do use parameters do not return any data.
I have configured the report to use two parameters. One called "StartDate", the other one "EndDate". Both are of type Date.
My stored procedures that use parameters have two parameters configured. One called "StartDate" and one called "EndDate".
These are both of type "Expression". The value for the StartDate parameter is [Parameters.StartDate]. The value for the EndDate parameter is [Parameters.EndDate] .
I believe this is the correct configuration to pass Date parameters from the report to the stored procedures. Unfortunately this does not work.
The stored procedures do not return any data.
Could you tell me how I can configure the report and stored procedures so that they actually return data?
Thanks.

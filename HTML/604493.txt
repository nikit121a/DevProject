Hi, I updated my operating system with the latest Windows updates this week, and the Toaster notifications which used to work perfectly, and not appearing anymore.
I don't getting any errors or warnings as far as I can see and even while stepping through the code everything seems fine.
 I'm not the only user here who is experiencing this after the updates. We were on DevExpress 16.2 before and have now upgraded to 17.2.5 but it did not make a difference. My colleague update his Windows first (while still on DevExpress 16.2) and I updated Dev Express to latest first, before installing the latest Windows updates and we both only experienced the Toaster Notification issue after the Windows Update.
I even tried to write a smaller piece of Toaster test code to see if  I can find an issue, but it behaves the same.
It there perhaps a fix or workaround that I can use to the the notifications to display?

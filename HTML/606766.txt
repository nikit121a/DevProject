Hi
I'm having some problems with the RichEditDocumentServer class when converting a specific .docx file to PDF. This document contains a form with clickable checkboxes  which are not rendered when exporting the document to PDF. Exporting in MS Word 2016 renders the checkboxes correctly.
The document in question comes from one of our customers. I do not know exactly how the form was created, but it seems to differ from the form created in Word 2016, because if I use that to add my own checkbox this will show up correctly in the PDF.
This simple program reproduces the issue.
I'm attaching the docx file with almost everything stripped but a single checkbox.

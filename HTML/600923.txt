Hi,
I'm using Angular 5 with DevExtreme Angular
I currently have a button that invokes validation like this via the 'onClick'
 
One of the items being validated is a DxTextBox.    I have recently hooked the 'onEnterKey' from this component.
I cannot figure out how to invoke the validation group using the  event passed in.   In general how can I invoke the validation group for a page without it be directly called from a button.   Get it from the instance of the button?
Thanks,
Nick H

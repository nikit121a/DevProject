Hi,
I have large dataset loaded on the grid when I try to copy entire content the application hangs till all data is copied to clipboard and the user remains clueless as the app grid becomes unresponsive.
What I would like to have is while all rows are getting's copied to clipboard  I would like to show a Wait indicator so the user is aware that the rows are getting copied.
Can you help me with some events to hookup the wait indicator
Also the copy functionality is very slow  can anything be done to improve its performance?
I am loading around 1000 rows and 50 columns  and it takes of 5 to 6 seconds.
Thanks,
Preeti.

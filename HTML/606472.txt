Hello, 
In 
 its is stated that: 
"Both MouseDown and DoubleClick events are not raised in response to a double-click in the row indicator area because they are suppressed by the GridListEditor that raised the ProcessSelectedItem event processed by ListViewProcessCurrentObjectController."
I have a situation in a XAF project which is under the following criteria: 
- The View is a ListView
- The View is not editable
- On single click, I want to do an action. 
- On double click, I want the regular ProcessCurrentObject behavior but without doing the above action. 
I followed 
 with the MouseDown event, but the second click is not recorded, since the ProcessCurrentObject method is called, therefore I only get the SingleClick action. 
Is there another way I can achieve the above? 
Thanks in advance.

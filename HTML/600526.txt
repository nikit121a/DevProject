Hello, Team!
 There is a problem with date occuring rules. DashboardDesigner doesn't change "DateType" parameter in a dashboard layout. If I change the parameter manually by a notepad, it works, but the component can't change it.
Example manually changed rule:
<GridItemFormatRule Name="Rule 1" DataItem="DataItem4" DataItemApplyTo="DataItem4">
          <FormatConditionDateOccuring 
>
            <AppearanceSettings AppearanceType="Purple" />
          </FormatConditionDateOccuring>
</GridItemFormatRule>
I attached the sample to show the problem, try to change the rule by the editor, it doesn't work. 
Also it is easy to reproduce in your's dashboard demos, for example here: 
1) add grid item
2) add "Date"column 
3) add some  DateOccuring rule - it doesn't work :-(

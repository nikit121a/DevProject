Hi,
Is it the intended functionality that when I collapse a grouped row (see screen shot), the listening event "OnSelectionChanged" is triggered?
For me, the "OnSelectionChanged" event is fired, and the (e) that is passed in has a "CurrentlySelectedList" that does not contain any rows in the collapsed group, even if they were selected.
This is making my custom OnSelectionChanged handler to think that when you collapse a group, you de-select all of that group's rows.
Is this something that can be prevented?
Or if it's not an intended functionality, do you know of what may be causing this to happen?
Thank you

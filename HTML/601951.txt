We are using your Line chart control  and Bar chart control, On showing values in the chart the series point values go outside the container, From the figure our series point value is 290 but the Y axis of the chart is shown up to a maximum of 270. We need to show the next higher value on the Y axis to make the highest series point inside the graph. For example, if 290 is the case, then a maximum of Y axis must be at least 300  or 330.

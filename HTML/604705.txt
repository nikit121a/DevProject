Hello,
Is there a way to remove trailing zeros on values displayed on the grid?
I am using this configuration
column.dataType = "number";
column.format = { type: "fixedPoint", precision: 1 };
column.editorOptions = { format: "#0.#" }
Value rounding is working correctly, for example,Â  18.199 is displayed as 18.2
In a another case, when the value is 18, I would like to show the value without the trailing zero as 18 instead of 18.0
Thanks for your support!

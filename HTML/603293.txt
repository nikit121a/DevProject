Hi,
I would like to do the same thing as seen here in this thread:
 Image:Â 
 Essentially, I want to split certain columns into two rows, using a MVCxGridView as in the above image. I'd also like to be able to still support Batch Editing as well, if possible.
Is there something like this currently for MVCxGridViews? The above solution was to use StackPanels, but I don't see that as an option in MVC.
Thanks

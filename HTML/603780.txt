1) Run the attached project w/ 17.1.8
2) Invoke the popup editor on the single cell
3) Note that the popup remains active and properly displays the messagebox
Now upgrade the project to 17.2.5 and try the same scenario.
Note that the popup closes as soon as the MessageBox is invoked.
The hotfix for T600459 does not address this.

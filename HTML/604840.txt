On the tabs i wish to put Colors to show the state of the tabbed controls (modified, loaded and such)
I have tried both the DrawTab and DrawTabEx but with one, the other or both but allways the Control is resetting to the Default color when changing the tab position.
How to i get a permanent Tab Color to show the user some info about the state of the tabs ? 
Thank you in advance and thanks for some GREAT products

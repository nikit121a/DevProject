Hello DevExpress-Team!
I want to achieve that if the voucher is canceled the whole row is gray (IsCanceledGray), even if there is a OpenAmount (OpenAmountNegativeRed).Â 
Unfortunately it doesn't change when I have the IsCanceled rule on the first or last position in the Format Rules Options.
From the Designer File
 I hope you can help me.
Regards,
Mario

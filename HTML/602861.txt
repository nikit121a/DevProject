Hi Team,
In my project I am having the scenario as described below.
Scenario :
1.  I am using a dropdownbox with treeview template which loads the data from webapi service.
2. The data will have a boolean field as 'IsSelected' .
3.  When loading the page it will call the webapi service method and loads data to the dropdownbox.
4.  If the above said field has data 'true' then checkbox for that item should be checked in the treeview and  also the text should get displayed in the 
       dropdownbox editor during the initial load.
Kindly provide me an example for this.
Regards,
Sneha

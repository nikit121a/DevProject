Hi, I am using MVC bar chart. To display data within the Series label I used the property   t.Label.TextPattern = "{A}  {V} ";. By using this the data is being populated. I like to know if I can add an empty space after the value ie {V} . To make the value more legible for the end-user.  I tried adding a space in the pattern. but it didn't reflect in the graph. Can you please give me a quick reply.

Hello,
Is there any tool available for nested rows? Consider the following data:Â 
{"bedroom": {"bed", "nightstand"}, "livingroom": {"TV, "sofa"}}
I would like to have a UI that displays a table with "bedroom" and "living room" each has a rowspan of 2. Please see attached screenshot for an example.
Thanks
Angel

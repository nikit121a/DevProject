I am following the examples in the KB for adding file attachments to my project. It is proving difficult to follow them.
I am failing to see where to add the FileAttachmentBase. I created my table (XPObject), but I can't add theÂ FileAttachmentBase base class since it is already a XPObject base class.
Do you have a sample project with a simple file attachment with the ORM Data Model?

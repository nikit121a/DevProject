Hello and thank you for your time.
I can't seem to get drag and drop events to fire on the BarButtonItem in a ribbon control.Â  We have a button that open a new rich edit control  and would like to be able to drop an existing document onto the button to have the app open that doc.
We can do it in winforms but not WPF.
Is this possible?
Thank you.

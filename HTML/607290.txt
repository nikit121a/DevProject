Hello,
I created two views (a cardview and a TcxGriDBTableView)
and I'm building a TPopupMenu that I use on both the Cardview and on
the TcxGridDBTableView this way:
Until then, the TPopupMenu is working on both views
Now, I would like to put an item in the TPopupMenu allowing me
to save the TcxGridDBTableView configuration with this code: 
But of course that can not work since
in this process, the TPopupMenu is not connected to the TcxGridDBTableView! 
How to fix this problem ?
Thank you for your help

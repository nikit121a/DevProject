Hello everybody,
I just noticed that the selection of and/or in the Data Filter Collection Editor for charts is not persisted. I did the following:
1. Add a new chart to a report
2. In the chart designer, open the Data Filter Collection Editor
3. Add two filter clauses
4. Switch from and to or
5. Close the chart designer
6. Open it again and open the Data Filter Collection Editor again
-> the selection has changed back to and
 I have attached my sample project and a short video. Thank you for your help.
Best regards
Christopher

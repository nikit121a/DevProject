Hello!
I'm using your WPF control suite together with the docking-solution from actipro  (
)
In my vb.net project I have a serious issue.
I have two actipro document tabs. I'd like to activate the second from within a RowDoubleklick Event of a DXGrid.on the first tab.
If the grid has set
everything works perfect. But if I set 
the tab will not be activated.
I have to set Row-Style in my UI because I do not want the editmode. Also if I set the Navigation style to Cell and disable editing the DoubleClick does not work.
In my opinion this is an issue coming from DevExpress. What do you think about?
In the attachment you find a Vs2017 sample solution   with three tabs. One tab that should be activated, one with a grid with Navigationstyle Row an one with cell. On both you see a standanrd button that activates the inactive tab, too.
Can you reproduce  the issue? Do you allready know this Problem? Do you know a solution?
It would be great if you could help me !
If you have any further questions please let me know.

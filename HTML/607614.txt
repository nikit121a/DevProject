Hi,
There seems to be a problem with the XtraCharts.SeriesSorting property.
In the screenshot "SeriesSorting.png", you can see the property "Reihensortierung" selected. Changing this property has no effect whatsoever on the sorting of the data series.
If I use the following script it works fine though:
private void chart12_BeforePrint(object sender, System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventArgs e) {
      chart12.SeriesSorting = SortingMode.Ascending;
}
Please note: the screenshot shows the chart within an XtraReport. The problem exists both when I put a chart on a windows form as well as within an XtraReport.
I could find no way of setting this property correctly through properties only in the XtraReport.
However, using both the Chart Designer and the Chart Assistant on a WinForm it is possible to set this property, see screenshot "chart_assistant.png"
If I may hazard a guess then I'd say that something got confused about sort series order and series sort order or some other very similar looking terms.

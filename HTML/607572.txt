Hello, DevExpress support, 
I have descendant of PopupContainerEdit which is used for searching in the inner grid, just like lookup. 
And I need that PopupContainerEdit's TextEdit still focused even if popup is opened, which was working perfectly in 17.1.4 when I upgraded to 17.2.5 
it's not working as intended, popup closes right after text edit got focus. 
Please check attached project (17.1.4) and compare behavior after update to 17.2.5
Thanks.

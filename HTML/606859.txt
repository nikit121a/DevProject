Hi,
we are using DevExpress WinForms controls in our product and are experiencing following issue.
When trying to change the text of TreeListNode, exception is thrown: Object is currently in use elsewhere. 
Please check the complete stacktrace in attachment.
We have experienced similar issue on several places already and some of my colleagues already reported number of tickets, but they were never resolved.
Unfortunately this exception is really rare and we cannot reproduce it reliably in our application - so there is not possibility to create sample app where this problem occurs. 
We would really appreciate if this can be fixed, since we cannot reliably fix it on our side and it's causing issues for our customers.
 
Could you have look at it and answer if there is some workaround or fix we can do?
In case of any further questions, please contact me on email below. 
Regards,
Eduard Krak

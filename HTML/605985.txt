Hi,
DockManager.RestoreLayoutFromXml and DocumentManager.RestoreLayoutFromXml not working as expected when part of a instantiated 
Â user control.
Since my code was part of a wider solution i created a thin project to show you the problem.
In resume, i create a user control in a tabbed document.
That  user control also has a tabbed document. That control RestoreLayoutFromXml doesnt work as expected.
I included a video and a thin functional code i used in the video.
Thank you.

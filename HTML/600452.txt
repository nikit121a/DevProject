I need to show a simple timeline for a day (12:00 am to 11:59 pm) that shows occupancy of room(s) (usually one room, but some multiple rooms.  I don't need to edit it or do anything fancy with it other than a label and some tooltips showing start/end times, description.  Visually they need to see at what times during the day it is going to be occupied.
This needs to be shown in the UI (static with occasional updates) and in reports as well.
Embedding a schedule object with timeline view seems like overkill .  I've got the suite of winforms Tools, is there any guidance one the best way using your tools to show this in winforms and xtrareports?
Thanks,
Brian

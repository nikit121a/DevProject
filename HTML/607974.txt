Hello team, 
  I should create spreadsheet during runtime to meet customers needs.
  but I stuck on how to create menu bar. 
  I saw one ticket before. (but now I can't find it.. sorry..)
  If I want to use the existing menu (like in the attachment, FormatNumberDecreaseDecimal button)
  then I should  follow up the designer code. 
  Anyway, I tried to do it but it draws the menu and icon as well
  however, button is not working. 
  (plz check WATCHME.gif! try put 0.9281 and click the FormatNumberDecreaseDecimal button) 
 [Attached solution, VS 2013] 
  Design project - I add menu with design mode. 
  Trial project - It's my trial to imitate the design code.
I hope the FormatNumberDecreaseDecimal works and I can create the menu by code.
thank you in advance.

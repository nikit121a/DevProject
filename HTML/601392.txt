Hello,
I've been attempting to  force controls (LayoutControlItem) within a LayoutGroup within a LayoutPanel to resize as the panel is resized.
No matter what widths = auto or horizontalalignment = stretch properties I give the various controls, adding a longer string to a TestItem control always forces the LayoutGroup to have a horizontal scrollbar as opposed to truncating the contents of the textbox or doing a text wrap.
I've also tried setting all of the ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll = "False". Didn't make a difference.
What am I missing? Everything up the XAML tree is set to auto width and horizontal stretch.
See attached picture for result.
Thanks!
Matt

Hello DevExpress-Team,
our most recent use case is to format the datagrid by rows instead of columns. 
We are already colorizing the cells by the given data from the datasourcen within the onCellPrepared event, however, we are not able to set a specific formatter on the cells/rows.
We already tried to set the element.value, element.text and element.displayValue properties without any success.
How can weÂ accomplish this case?

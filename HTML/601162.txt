Hi,
 I overrode SetValueBeforePost() of TcxSchedulerDBStorage in a derived class to set specific field values.
I was a bit confused about this, so I set the Rangechecks OFF, and everything went fine
I couldn't find any explanation for this. AItemIndex seems to be correct.
 Why do I need to put Rangechecks OFF here?
Regards,
Ollo

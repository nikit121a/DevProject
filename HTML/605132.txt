Hi,
There is a problem in scaling to a different DPI with the header of an TcxGridBandedTableView whenÂ the option (view) HeaderAutoHeight is false.
The header is not scaled based on the DPI setting which I had expected.
The following code I use to fix this problem manually



where the "aScaleFactor" is the factor of NewDPI / OldDPI .
Best Regards
Rob Renaud

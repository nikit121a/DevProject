I am trying to determine when a click on DevExpress Scheduler Appointment is a Single Click or Double Click.
With a single click, I create a New Appointment...
With a Double Click, I populate the Headers.
My problem is, when I double click, it goes through the code for single and double click taking a long time.
I want to go through MouseClick event when there is one click and MouseDoubleClick event when I double click.
I would appreciate if you can send me some code sample.
Thanks.

Hey
We're buiding a angular 5 application and are interested in devextreme pivot grid. 
 When we present a pivot,
we'd like to use our own components to present data (observable, async) (angular-way)
Is there a way, or are there plans to do 
stuff like implemented in  datagrid?
a really nice approach would be if we could do something like this:
fields: [{
                caption: 'Employee',
                dataField: 'employeeId',
                area: 'row',
                 dataType: 'customEmployeeNameType'
            }]
<dx-pivot-grid>
    <div *dxTemplate="let data of 'customEmployeeNameType'">
        {{(data.value | idToEmployee | async)?.employeeName | displayableNameToString}}
    </div>
</dx-pivot-grid>
We've already seen that we could use  events like format, customizeText, selector etc. but all events have string applied as return type. But we need async stuff...
Thx in advance

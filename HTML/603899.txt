I have a grid that uses a MemoEdit. I have enabled auto row height and pixel scrolling.
I'm finding that the scrolling will not go to the bottom if the form height is not large enough to show the last row in full.
See images.
Image 1 : Working because last row fits
Image 2: Not working I cannot scroll to bottom because row does not fit
Additional Info: exporting to Excel exports all data correctly

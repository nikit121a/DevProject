I am just trying to populate theÂ TcxDBEXTLookupCombobox with a datasource. I use this datasource for other db grids so I know it works. When I go to select ListFieldItem from the properties it is empty.
I have got to be missing something really simple - I am a VB.Net developer working with Delphi now.

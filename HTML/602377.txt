I have an interesting situation.  
I have a form that has the following
   SplitControl
         Panel1
             PivotGrid
         Panel2 
             ButtonBar (with all the Chart controls ) 
             ChartControl
I am trying to duplicate some of this on a UserControl - and I am running into an issue
When I have
UserControl
   SplitControl
         Panel1
             PivotGrid
         Panel2 
             ChartControl
         
and then right click on the Chart Control - use the quick action button in the upper right - and choose Bar Manager.   
It does not place the ButtonBar  in the Panel2 - but at the top of the UserControl.  Which is NOT where I want it :) 
So - I am wondering how I can get the button bar to dock in the Panel2 at the top???  Which is where I have it in the original form.  The attached screen shot shows how the current form looks.   
Is it possible to dock the buttonbar in the Panel2 of the SplitControl (which is how it is in the main form)

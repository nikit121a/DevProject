We have been experiencing some rather odd behavior with the serialization of the Dock Layout Manager.  In essence the control windows that are saved do not always open up at the same location as when they were serialized, and sometimes the controls won't even show up at all.  The behavior seems to be sporadic as sometimes it will work and other times it will not.  I've included a sample test project that demonstrates the issues that we're seeing.  There's a Test.xml file included that you can use to load and see what is happening, the Example.png image shows how the page layout looked with all of the controls prior to saving and restoring.

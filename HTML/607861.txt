I am currently using an IDataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider to provide a dynamic MySQL connection string to clients using the web report designer. Is there a way for me to run some initial SQL statements once DevExpress uses the connection string to establish a connection?
To give some context, I am trying to run the following SQL statement after a connection is established:
SET time_zone = '<some dynamic time zone>';
Running this statement would allow each client to view timestamp fields within his/her own time zone. I've tried researching a way to run this statement as part of the connection string itself, but to my knowledge,  that is not possible.
Thanks in advance for any help your support team can provide.

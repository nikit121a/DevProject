Hello Support,
I have been looking into the Mail Merge feature you have and wondered if I can use it to send a mail shot. I understand that you do not provide a mail client but this is fine, I can sort that out. 
My question is , once the mail merge has been created, how do I iterate through the individual entries and take the contents to use as content of an email. I do not want to attach the entry to the email as a file but need the contents.Â 
Thank you in advance.

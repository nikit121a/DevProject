Dear DevExpress team,
one of our customers has the problem that his Sophos Firewall ( Sophos UTM 9) detects POST request as possible SQL injections.
Log entry:
We examined this problems and discovered the actual problem: The name attributes of the input elements of the DevExpress ASP.NET components are automatically generated. For example: ctl00$mainContent$ComboBoxLanguage$DDD$L. In the POST request this name is sent as argument name with the specific values. 
The firewall checks this argument names for special characters to avoid possible SQL injections. There is only a maximum of 3 special characters allowed, but based on the DOM location the generated name attribut contains more than 3 $-signs. 
Is there any way to  avoid this problem? Is there any way to change how the name attribute is generated?
Greetings,
Jakob Thiersch

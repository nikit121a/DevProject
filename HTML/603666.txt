I have 3 Gridviews on a page.  Based on the row selected in the first I want to display data in the sub grids based on an ID from the first grid.  I am using the FocusedRowChanged event.  And I am updating a Session variable.  I then told the Data sources to rebind, when they do they aren't using the new session variable so the other grids don't update correctly.  Seems to be something simple I am missing

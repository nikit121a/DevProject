Hello,
let we have flow of trades with following characteristics:
* Trade direction (Buy or Sell)
* Currency (USD/RUB, EUR/RUB etc)
* Trade Volume
I need to visualize structure of this flow taking into account both Buy/Sell and Currency features:
Buy
 - USD/RUB: 100
 - EUR/USD: 250
Sell
 - USD/RUB:120
 - EUR/USD: 300
 - CNY/USD: 120
I.e. we have two categorical dimensions (trade direction, currency) and one floating-point direction. 
How to visualize it using DevExtreme? (I have posted related ticket with two pie-chart-halves)

Call me crazy, I own the extended experience and assign to my dev team. I saw diagram control and flipped out. I want to ask if my dev express controls will work with the free version of visual studio?
w?hat this crazy kids wants to do is build my own app by using VS and the diagram control with 0 code, lol. Can I do it?
I just love DEV EX for my windows applications. My Dev team could do this for me I assume, but, I am interested in just trying. 
S?o so whats your advice? Win forms, WPF, lol ?
b?est, Bill
p?s, ok to laugh at me. I am good at figuring shit out but I know I wont be a coder anytime soon.

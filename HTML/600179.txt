I have a bar chart where I'm using a custom ElementTemplate for the SeriesLabel so that I can display it in a particular font and text color. Part of this customisation is removing the colored background on the label.
The problem comes when the bar is too small to display the label, so the label is moved to sit just outside  the bar. In this case I need to change the text color, since a color that looks okay when displayed on the bar can't be seen clearly when just displayed on the chart background.
I've attached a solution containing anÂ example.  If you run this you'll see the label for the fourth bar is displayed, but the text is too unclear to read easily.
 Is there a way to detect when the label is moved and change its template/style accordingly? I'm using MVVM, so I'd like to stay consistent with this if possible.

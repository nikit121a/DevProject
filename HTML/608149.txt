Hey Devexpress,
I've been trying to translate the tooltips of the  RichEditUICommands but can't seem to figure out how to.
Currently we translate all other controls via  theÂ DXLocalizers, but not only can i not find the right localizer for the job, i can't find the enums either.
Look at the attached image if in doubt of what property i want translated.
Help with being pointed in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.

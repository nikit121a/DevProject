Hi there,
I am having a problem with two list boxes.
The first is a list of campuses, and when you select a campus from the first list, it populates a second listbox with a list of rooms at that campus.  This part works fine and everything gets populated ok.
The problem is that when I click a button to retrieve the room details, it returns a null reference exception for the lstRooms list box, but the lstCampus listbox returns the Campus I selected.
The code it below:
The javascript is 
And the code behind for the cbCampusChanged Callback is
The code behind to retrieve the values from the list box is
The lstRooms.SelectedItem.Text causes the exception, but the lstCampus.SelectedItem.Text works without a problem.  The only thing I can think of that is different is that I perform a callback after the Campus has changed and I don't do that after the room is selected, but I am not sure how I do that.
Anyway, I hope that is clear enough.  Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.
thanks,
Darren

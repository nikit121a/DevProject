Hi,
Is it possible to modify the display order of the (default) command buttons:
It seems that when you use:
settings.CommandColumn.ShowNewButton = true;
settings.CommandColumn.ShowDeleteButton = true;
settings.CommandColumn.ShowEditButton = true;
The display order is fixed.
Is there somekind of "DisplayIndex" property or something or do I have to create a special template for this?

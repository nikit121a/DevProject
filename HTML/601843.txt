Hi.
I need to be able to dynamically set the connectionstring and datasource for the XtraReport Designer. The scenario is this:
1. A user opens the application and starts designing a report from a choosen source of data. This could be a Stored Procedur, a WebService or whatever. This creates a local Sqlite-databas on the server, unique for the user, his session and hit TAB. This means should he open another tab and do the same thing another another sqlite-db is created.
2. The way we separate this is that we have our own "internal sessionobject" in the session with a GUID as id, and this GUID is autogenerated and in all URL's for the user in his TAB. Should he open another TAB a new "internal sessionobject"  is created and a new GUID will be generated and in the url for this tab.
3. Our internal sessionobject keeps track of connectionstring to the Sqlite-db (which part of the name is our internal GUID sessionid). How can we set this in the ReportDesigner dynamically?
In our global.asa we have the following:
And in the WizardConnStringsProvider:
But this is the line where it goes wrong:
Because if the user now opens another tab OR another user starts the application, they will all get mismatched connectionstrings.
So I think my questions are:
1. Is it it any way possible in the WizardConnStringsProvider get hold of the QueryString? It always returns null....
2. Is there any way possible in the codebehind of the ReportDesigner.aspx to "get hold of" and manipulate the WizardConnStringsProvider? By example setting the correct values in page_load?
3. What are your recommendations?
Thanks
P.s In a Dashboard we have solved it like this:
Is it possible to do something like that with the xtraReport?

Hi,
I have a gridview designed at  runtime.
All columns are designed in a certain order.
The user can mask some column via a button, and make them visible again.
Problem is that even if the allowmove property is set to false, when the column get visible again, the initial position  isn't keeped, seems to be visibleindex - 1 every time.
In that void, I just get all gridcolumn that can be invisible, and just make visible = true or false.
Is there anything I forgot ?
Regards

Hello DevExpress support,
Need you advice on how to place custom control on top of the ribbon. 
Please see screenshot in attached archive.
I need to places there a control consisting of two dropdowns.
Suspect it will be to implement a custom RepositioryItem but may be you can recommend which one to use as a base one.
Sample project is attached.
Thanks in advance.

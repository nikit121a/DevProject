I'm doing drag'n drop between two GridControl using the new drag'n drop event system of version 17.2. I'm trying to personalize the Action text of the hint during the drag'n drop operation. To do so I tried the method decribed in the ticket 
 using a custom GridControlLocalizer class. In this case it's used with the DragDropManager and I can't make it work with the new event system. Is there a way to personalize the Action text of hint on the event system ? The presentation of the hint is perfect for my need, except the Action text. If possible I don't want to write a complete template for the hint.

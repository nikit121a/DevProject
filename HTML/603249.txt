Hi support,
So I?m newbie in MVC developer using DevExpress and I using ado.net with MVC 5 not EF etc.
I try to connect my repository using ado.net store procedure with GridView, but I've some error?s.
Can you help me to solve this erros? using my repository with ado.net to bind GridView for CRUD operations.
I attach my project using a simple model Funcionario and FuncionarioController for your verifications.
My Repository is in directory /Repository file FuncionarioRepository.cs using Conexao.cs to connect to database sqlserver.
So, I was able to read from the database and load in the gridview with some errors, but insert update and delete did not.
Please you could fix my project to perform all the operations of crud with the Gridview using my repository:
FuncionarioRepository.cs ?
Thank you.

Good morning,
we have considered updating to 17.1.9. But it seems the errors in the RichEditControl haven't been fixed.
Please see attached .gif 
1) When i switch to readonly = false the comments are still readonly. Only after editing them in the review pane they become editable
2) When i select all text of one comment in the review pane i cannot delete it
3) When i select the last two lines or so of one comment and click a key, the editor replaces the text in the next comment 
I didn't bother to test any further. Do you know theese bugs? Are they fixed in the newest version ?
Kind regards 
Martin

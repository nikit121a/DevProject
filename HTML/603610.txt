Hi,
I am working on C# WinForms application.
I am using ColorEditÂ control within devexpress grid. I want to show only the colors defined in my code in the drop down of coloredit control. I had achieved that.
The color popup (which is displayed when click on the coloredit control) shows the color in ARGB format.
I want to show the color list elements in hex format like "#rrggbb" format. For e.g. #ffffff
Please suggest the way to achieve it.
I had attached the sample project with this for reference.
Looking forward to quick reply. 
Thanks,
Gaurav

Hello,
We have an issue with the Grid Control FormatCondition when attempting to align the Icon at the left of the text.
I have seen in a post that you suggest to use the  HorizontalContentAlignment = "Right". This solution does not work. (Left or Right)
To set the UI, we are using resourcedictionary to add data to the grid control through a dataset.
DEFAULT GRID COLUMN
ICON SET TEMPLATE
The Window in XAML
How can we align the icon at the left. It used as a visual infoÂ  about the content of the cell?
As you can see in the image below, we are managing background and icons as planned except for the icon position.
Thank you for your help
Pierre

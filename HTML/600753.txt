Hello,
I have reviewed T593874. However, we also need to take the current resource of the cell into the converter. How can I access it?
I have seen  the TimelineCellControl - Member "Content", which is of type TimelineCellViewModel, which offers the date interval as well as a Resource. That resource is unfortunatly always set to EmptyResourceItem.
Regards
Gabriel

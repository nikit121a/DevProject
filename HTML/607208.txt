Hello!
I have buttons which are in a callback panel. These buttons are disabled by default but can become enabled (with button "Enable" in attached project). 
The problem is as following: when I perform a callback of the callback panel  (with button "Callback" in attached project), we can see a flash of the color of the button. But the button is always disabled after a callback (ClientEnabled = false), so it would be always grey.
In the attached zip file, there are a sample and a video which demonstrate the problem.
So, how is it possible to prevent this flash after a callback?
Thanks for your help !
Best regards!
Alex

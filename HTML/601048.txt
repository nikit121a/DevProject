Hi support team,
I'm working with dx-chart lines graph mode and I'd like to know if it's possible to  start and to end in a specific values. I attach an image where I like to suppressÂ the '0' value and the '7' value in that specific case. I tried with the several options from the API documentation but anyone worked.
Thanks in advance
Regards

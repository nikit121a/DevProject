Hello.
ASPxUploadControl worked OK when it was just in DIV . But it's event OnFileUploadComplete not  ceased  to fire when I placed thiscontrol into jQuery dialog.
I found the same ticked  Q489770. But it  was long time ago and jQuery and even does not have method "clean" which was fixed by your developers to resolve the problem.
Thanks in advance,
Alexander.

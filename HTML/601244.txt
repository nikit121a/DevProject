Hi, 
I am trying to change property captions at runtime based on another propertys value. 
Simple i have a Master object with single property named 'Year'. 
And i have a non persistent object which has a reference to master object. 
In that non persistent object there are properties named 'Month1', Month2', .... and so on. 
I want to change those properties captions to 2017 / January, 2017 / February .... and so on when the NonPersistentObject.MasterObject property changed. 
I have attached a simple project that shows my issue and how i did try to do the required task. 
To see problem on sampel; 
1- Run the program. 
2- Select first (2016) record on the MasterObject ListView
3- Click the SAmple Action to invoke the Non Persistent object's DetailView. 
4- See that Month Captions didnt change. They are : MONTH 1, MONTH 2, MONTH 3 and so on..
5- Dont close the detailview and SELECT the 2017 master object. See that the captions changed like 2016 / JANUARY, 2016 / FEBRUARY .. and so on. This is wrong they were must be the initial caption when the detailview shown. 
6. Dont close the detailview and SELECT the 2018 master object. Note that the captions didnt change again. 
7- Dont close the detailview and SELECT the 2016 master object. See that the captions changed like 2017 / JANUARY, 2017 / FEBRUARY .. and so on
I am trying to achive my goal in ViewController_ItemCreated and ObjectSpace_ObjectChanged events in the Module.Web  NPSampleNonPersistenObject_VCD viewcontroller. You can check the code for more details. 
Any help will appreciate. 
Thanks. 
Ak?n G?NE?

I would like to determine whether an InvoiceDate falls within a specific financial period. The financial period has a StartDate and a EndDate.
How do I filter the table to determine the correct record in VB?
I've tried the following but it only returns nothing:
 Dim obj As CustomerStatementPeriod = Session.FindObject(Of CustomerStatementPeriod)(CriteriaOperator.Parse("StartDate <= ? AND EndDate >= ? ", InvoiceDate, InvoiceDate)

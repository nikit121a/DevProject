Good Morning,
What could you suggest for me to use in the DevExpress toolbox to be able to do the following? is there a built in object that can already do this?
1. Have 2 List A Source And A Destination List.
2. Have  Add A single item from Source List to Destination List,
3. Remove A Single Item from Destination List.
4. Check if Selected item in the Source List is Already Existing  in the Destination List
Best Regards,
Noel Isip

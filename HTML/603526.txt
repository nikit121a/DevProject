Hello Support,
I have placed one label in group footer which shows summary of one field  with Sum per Group.
Let say I am getting total value 124 as sum but I want to display this value as 02:04 .
Here 124 is total minutes and I want to convert  it in HH:mm format so it will be 02:04.
 Is this possible without writing server side events in version 17.1.9 ?
OR
 Is this possible without writing server side events in version 17.2 ?
Thank You.

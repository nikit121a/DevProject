I have data which represents counts per cohort per hour of the day.
The hour of the day is just represented in the data as a number from 0-23.
I have successfully modified the axis label, usingÂ 
chartOptions.argumentAxis.label.customiseText to return my required string, and configuring it inside onWidgetCreated.
In addition, I want to format the tooltip heading on the chart to display the hour the same way....
See the attached image.
Examples I have found indicate how to format a series value, but that isn't what I want to change - all the series display fine in the tooltip.
How can I modify just the "x-axis heading" part of the tooltip?

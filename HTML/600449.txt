Hello,
I have a problem with the pivot grid comtroller: as documented in the attach, I would split free space between all columns of pivot, and not only in the first one.
The width of the pivot grid is set by a javascirpt on the windows ready or resize windows.
Could you please give me any suggestion to overcome such an issue?
Thanks in advance,
Best Regards.

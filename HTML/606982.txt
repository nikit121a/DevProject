Hello,
I'm trying  to create an app where the user can drag and drop nodes from an "account" treelist (to the left) to a "header" treelist ( to the right), and then back. The left account list is a one level list, and the right header list  is in four levels, where the accounts always should be placed below the least level, the fifth.
The dragdrop action from left to right works, but all data is lost (or at least not visual).
The dragdrop action from right (only fifth level) to left should make the node to be placed at root level in the left list.  The data should of cause follow.
Hope you can understand what I mean/want?
Best regards 
/Magnus

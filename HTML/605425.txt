I am using a 
in my code.My requirement is that I want a particular command to execute from my view model when the 
is 
from a specific cell in datagrid.
I tried using following code but it takes the function from code-behind rather than view model
When tried to do it using interaction trigger it gives an error
How can I achieve it ?

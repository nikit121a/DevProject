I have screen in my application wich is canvas layout and in the canvas there is a collection of wpf controls.
My requirement to give the user possible to hide elements and take them back.
I saw that you have a lot of Â perfect implementations for this behavior like in the tabs or in the grid's columns that the user can hide column and take it back.
My question is if I have possible to use with one of your implementation to hide simple microsoft control.
Do you have a easy way to do that.
thank a lot of all.

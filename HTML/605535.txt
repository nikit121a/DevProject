Hi, I would like to know if would be possible to initialize AspxDateEdit Calendar on  year Navigation, 
In case of BirthDate infact, is difficult to navigate from null or today date to birthDate. 
Would be more confortable to start with decade or century  selection and the by simply clicks jump to year, month and finally day.
Is it possible?
Thank you

I am reviewing my logs, and see that one of our customers has some issue that looks to be triggering a flood of events into Logify.  Two questions:
1.) When this happens, does it count against the number of submissions that are permitted?  
2.) Is there any version where it wont report the same error more than X times? 
Example:  
Thanks.

Hi.
I'mÂ  migrating from an old version of the SpreadSheet component. In the old version if I want to sum a range of cells, for example =SUM(A2:A1) the cell range remains like this.
In the new version if I do the same when I double click in the cell, the cell range change from =SUM(A2:A1) to =SUM(A1:A2)
How can I prevent this?
Thanks.

Hi
I'm trying to use a Scheduler component in an ASP.NET Core MVC partial view and I'm getting this error: "Cannot use a lambda expression as an argument to a dynamically dispatched operation without first casting it to a delegate or expression tree type",Â 
What am I doing wrong?
My partial view:
The error is shown in ".Editing" and ".Resources".
Regards

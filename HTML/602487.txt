I was able to setup the diagram control and bind some data to it.
In the template designer I chose a circle and a n connector template. That works quite fine. All circles are created and connected accordingly to the links I setup.
My model looks like this:
I don't understand how I would create multiple design templates which are rendered based on some condition (model type or property)
For example:
Now I want to achieve multiple things:
- I want to put a label on top of the circle bound to each stage  name
- I would like to render all items within a stage into that circle.
- Each item should be visualized based on the type, let's say, an arrow for Type == 1 and a circle for Type == 2
- How would I do the positioning?
How can I achieve that? 
Thanks for the help!

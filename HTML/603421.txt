Hi again,
 
This issue is related to issue 
. We found that the Chart Designer is not suited for our end-users. 
Our preferred approach is to supply the users with the ability to switch SeriesTemplate using a combo-box. 
 
In the attached project I'd like to be able to switch between AreaFullStackedSeries2D, BarSideBySideSeries2D and LineSeries2D using the combo-box. I was hoping it would be possible to use the XYDiagram2D.SeriesItemTemplateSelector for this. But I haven't been able to get it to work.
 
Can you please help me out here?
Regards
Petter Ballandby

Hi,
I used to have a group box control with dozens of radio buttons inside it - Please refer the attached picture. 
Then I have this function that loops over the radio buttons within a given control, and stores in a variable the name of the checked radio button - If one is checked. When no radio button is checked my variable content is set to 
. This method works just fine when the parent control for the radio buttons is a std. group box.
As the number of radio buttons within my original group box grew up, I added a XtraTab control named 
s to my form, and replaced my line of code from this to this
If there is any radio button checked within the parent control, the variable 
 returns the name of the radio button, and my logic takes from there...
I have 3 similar variables to capture possibly active radio buttons across 3 controls, and they?re populated normally when the control type is a group box. When the parent control is a XtraTab control, the variable content is kept as 
 even though a radio button is checked in the XtraTab. Because it is kept as nothing, I?m unable to determine if I have a radio button checked within the XtraTab control...
Below you can see a short version of my function - How can I loop over the radio buttons within a XtraTab control and get the same result I get when I use a std. group box?

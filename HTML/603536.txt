Hi DX Team, 
is there a way to set styles with EditSettings based on RowData.Row binding? I mean I might have property like "IsDefault" in my object and I want to set binding for editors like this:



And converter:




But it does not affect the editors.
I know the CellTemplate gives me that ability quit easily but EditSettings was recommended for me underÂ 
 ticket.
If you have better way of doing it, I'm open to your solutions, but please keep them under MVVM design pattern. 
Best Regards,
Kamil

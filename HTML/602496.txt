Hello,
in the meantime we have many customers that have different desires.
Is there a way to enable/disable parts of a given model layout depending on, for example, compiler directives or static boolean variables ?  
We want to disable a tab, layoutgroup, field or button for customer A, but enable these for customer B and another combination for customer C.
Thank you
Michael

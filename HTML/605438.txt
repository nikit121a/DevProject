Hi,
I am having an issue since my last update to 17.2.4...
 I have a small app where I change connection string to an application... However from update when I try to notify user I have an error of "Layout measurement override of element 'DevExpress.Xpf.LayoutControl.LayoutGroup' should not return NaN values as its DesiredSize."
Worst than that... is...
If I set showNotification at begin of command without anything else it fires ok.
However if I trigger it in body of command... I have that exception.... 
Can you help undestand how so?
I am attaching this project...

I have a lot of InvalidPropertyPath error in the output of Visual Studio, but I don't know which controller triggers them.
If set theÂ 
 level to 4, the InvalidPropertyPath error doesn't appear into the log file.
What is the way to find the origin (the controllers) of these InvalidPropertyPath errors in order to remove them ?

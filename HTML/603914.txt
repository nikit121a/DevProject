Hi,
we have verified an error exporting large datasets in server mode grid.
This is the scenario:
We have a query that extract from a "SQL Server 2012 Standard" 290K records, and the application compiled at 32bits stops working, for memory issue.
We used anÂ  EntityServerModeSource, this is my export code:




I've attached the screenshot of memory situation.
Seems that the ExportToXls method write all record in memory before writing on the excel file.
Bye,
a.

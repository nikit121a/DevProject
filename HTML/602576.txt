Hello! Sorry for my bad english.
I make tree view with single-selection mode and filtering field
https://plnkr.co/edit/pcRHKtpCksJ7LaDebCXh?p=previewÂ 
1. go to filter box and write 'plus' - then displayed only items, contains this word
2. select one item. now give message - item selected. When tree unfocused - this item displayed as gray .
3. now clear filter box and write 'led'  - then displayed items with this word
4. select one item - now give message - item selected. When tree unfocused - this new item displayed as gray .
5. clear filter box - now hilight OLD selected item. No messages about changing selection. 
IMHO after clearing filter, need hilight NEW item, or generate notification about changing selection to old.

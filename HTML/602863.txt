Hi,
In the Pivot Grid, the user can filter various parameters and move data fields.
Is there a way for the user to save the such settings in Pivot Grid?
If yes, can such save settings be shared with others users using the same Pivot Grid.
For example, one user save the Pivot Grid setting with Year : 2017.Â  One returning to the Pivot Grid (same web page) the user can re-call the Year setting.
Thanks for assistance.

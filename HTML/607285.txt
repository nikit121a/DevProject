Dear DevExtreme Team,
we are using dxDataGrid with enabled group-panel in an angular5 application. We have our own backend attached (which does all the sorting / filtering) of the data and therefor use a CustomStore which maps your LoadOptions onto our QueryParameters object.
All of this works very nicely!
Now we have the following issue:
- When dragging one column to the group columns, everything is grouped nicely
- Now when collapsing one of the groups inside the grid, the LoadOptions get a filter for "<>" (not equal) for this specific group, so that this group is no longer returned => also this works nice
- When finally changing the sorting of the group column, things go bad:
=> We now receive multiple load calls in the CustomStore. Some of the calls don't have filters set, some don't have sortings set
It feels like that the grid throws multiple events when partially filled LoadOptions.
 Please see the attached screenshot. This is a "console.log(loadOptions);" in the load method of the store.
All three logs have been dispatched by a single click on re-sorting the group column.
Also you can see from the screenshot, that one of the LoadOptions tries to filter ">" (GreaterThan) on a string value which is obviously not possible and results in a server-side error for us. 
Thanks for any help on this topic!

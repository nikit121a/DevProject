Hi,
I have a batchedit grid that has a number of columns grouped.
The following setting is turned on.
DevExpress hangs.
if I have it turned off  I can expand each row individually.  The problem is for the grid I need it to display all data expanded.  With the batchedit grid and continuous paging I expected that it would just render the pages as I scroll down the list.
I'm binding the data  using entity framework.
I've attached an example of the sheet.  The above shows the columns.

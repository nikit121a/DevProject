System.Windows.Data Error: 4 : Cannot find source for binding with reference 'RelativeSource FindAncestor, AncestorType='System.Windows.Controls.UserControl', AncestorLevel='1''. BindingExpression:Path=DataContext.ShowMarkers; DataItem=null; target element is 'LineScatterSeries2D' (Name='LineScatterSeries2D'); target property is 'MarkerVisible' (type 'Boolean')

Having just spent a 
 long time cussing and trying to add a control to a LayoutTable before finally noticing that LayoutMode=Table, could you please improve the designer to support TableLayout better!
1) Start with showing an overlay on the LayoutGroup its self, showing  the Rows and Columns.
2)  Dragging and Dropping should highlight the TableLayout cell being dragged over rather than the Regular drag drop hints
3) When two controls are in a Table Cell, this should be highlighted with help to, say, reduce the extended span of an existing control .

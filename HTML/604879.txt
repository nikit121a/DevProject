Hello,
i'm using custom edit form in gridcontrol for the first time. Can you please give me an example to show how to populate a combobox  in that custom edit form? I first tried to use the build in edit form and everything works fine. All comboboxes are populated.
After changing to my custom edit form the comboboxes don't show items anymore, only the value from bounded datatable.
Thanks for support!
Michael

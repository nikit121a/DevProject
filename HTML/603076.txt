Hello XAF Team,
I implemented this example in my Project and need additional information about New Item Row,
When I create a new record via New Action , opened DetailView's BO type is CustomTypePermission object and ExportState property is visible and assignable.
When I create a new record via New Item Row, created object type is PermissionPolicyTypePermissionObject and upcasted ExportState property is visible but not assignable.
How can I manage New Item Row  created BO type?
Thanks for your interest.

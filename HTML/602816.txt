Hi,
 I need to customize "Change Image" dialogue in MVC HtmlEditor. I need only use images from gallery and I have already changed some settings - See below. 
My questions are: 
1. why I cannot apply changes?
2. Can I make the width 200 px as default?
3. Can I make the checkBox selected by default?
4. Can I select the CSS class as default?
See also the attached pdf.
Regards

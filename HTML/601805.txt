Dear Support! 
We have recently upgraded DevExpress Nugets from 17.1.6 to 17.2.5
We need your help to clarify regression in the functionality of "FORMAT RULES" contextual menu in the PivotGrid 17.2.5 version.
It appears that in 17.2.5 Single Mouse "Right Click"  will immediately display 
expanded "Format Rules" sub menu  
actually displaying 
 
root sub menu element. 
If we attempt to append/include "Format Rule" sub menu to any existing context menu
the sub menu elements will attach to the root menu without a nice sub menu divider ("Format Rules")
In 17.1.6 we see that "Format Rule" sub menu consistently present in Right Click scenarios 
as well as during inclusion of the Format Rules in the  more complex parent menu
I can replicate this problem 100% of the time.
I have attached 2 solutions that have IDENTICAL code that includes empty PIVOT GRID with
this.pivotGridControl1.OptionsMenu.EnableFormatRulesMenu = true;
In the ZIP file you will see 2 folders  Pivot.17.2 and Pivot.17.1
You will find a screenshot in each folder that clearly demonstrates the issue.
Currently this is a show stopper for us as it messes up our CONTEXT menus in the PIVOT GRIDs.
Your immediate attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.
Since I added actual Dlls the file is > 30Mb   (Silly limit?)

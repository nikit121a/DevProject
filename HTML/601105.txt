Hi,
I have a big problem for a month, and I can not solve. I read all posts but without finding a solution.
I published my website on a server (IIS 8) where there is folder structure like below url
LOCAL:
DXR.axd
But in published site it is showing 404 erroe with below URL, i dont know from where it is generating and it is not occuring in Local
REMOTE:
On local server it works, but  not working in live.
Server Error
404 - File or directory not found.The resource you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.

Hi guys
I had a new issue related to aspxdockpanels. 
When I create the DockPanels directly into the aspx code, Aspxdockmanager's GetPanelByUID method finds the Dockpanel. 
If I create it in realtime, I mean, in codebehind, with exatcly the same parameters, so this method mentioned above doesnt ! Why?
I created the attached sample project based on this demo:  
Explanation:
There're 2 dockpanels inside aspx code (lines 102 to 116) . It's commented. So, I create these 2 dockpanels in codebehind. In JS, I cant find the panel, so, state cookies doesnt save aniyhing. too. 
If I do the inverse, it means, I "uncomment" the DocksPanels in aspx code, and I comment all the lines in codebehind, so it works fine! JS and cookies! Normally. 
How to fix it?

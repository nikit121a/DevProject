Thanks for the sample.  I'm currently playing around with the settings.
3.  You didn't address showing a timeline in xtra reports.  Can a simple 24hr timeline of current day be shown for multiple sets of rooms?  (Zone 1 group - show 2 room timelines, Zone 2 group - show 1 room timeline, zone x group.....)
Thanks,
Brian

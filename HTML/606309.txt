Hello,
I'm using the PDFViewer and I try to make a list of all annotations.Â 
I added a picture of what i want to achieve (I made a rectangle around it). As you can see, i need all annotations and all of their metadata,
like the message, the name etc.
My question is how can i get all this? Are there any variables i can use or something?
Thank you!

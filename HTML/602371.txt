hi team,
We have one application in which user design and save diferent  layouts of same report and later they schedule the reports  by selecting saved layouts,
now we want to display parameter panel only at the time of schduling the report , so that different user witll enter different values to generate appropriate report.
we want to save parameter collection with values enter by user to generate report at scheduled time.
kindly suggest how can i display the parameter panel only at the time of scheduling.

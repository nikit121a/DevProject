I have a pivotgrid that has two grand totals at the bottow row. In order to have two grand totals. I have to make a few changes. One of those changes is to set OptionsDataField.Area to PivotDataArea.RowArea. This causes the layout of the pivot to distort causing the last column (Used in Blend) to over-expand its column width. Also there is an extra column called Data. I would like to remove the column.

Hello,
We have upgraded to new DevExpress version and new security module.
In "old version" we have created a user preferences business object where user can decide if he wants to work with MDI or SDI.
We override LoggedOn event and update ShowViewStrategy depending on user preferences.
Since with new version this code does not work anymore. You can find a simplify project in attachment to reproduce this issue. 
When we set UserPreferences.EnableMdiMode true or false, it's always the MDI mode that is enable (from model).
How we can fix this? 
Thanks,
Anthony

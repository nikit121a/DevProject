Hello,
I try to explain a simplified the situation:
I have a Form with a TextEdit control ..
And a main RibbonControl with menu and other buttons ...
If I edit a value on TextEdit and confirm with Enter Key or Tab, every thing works fine.
And a calculation is done ...
If a click on Ribbon before to leave the TextEdit the sequence event is
Ribbon.Click
TextEdit.Leave
But this is not good for me because the Edited Value is not confirmed and the calculation start with a not updated value.
is there a convinient way like to make TextEdit.Leave before Ribbon.Click?
other suggestions?
Thankyou 
Gianluca

Hello Team,
I have a model with the information format as below:
Class 1: 
# Males = 25 
# Females = 2 0
# Passed =  35
Class 2: 
# Males = 15 
# Females = 2 0
# Passed =  25
....
I am trying to show the information in Side-by-Side Stacked Bar format. It is a bit different from the example of Side-by-Side Stacked Bar in the demo, as the two groups are related but different. A basic code snippet, to implement such a requirement would be very helpful. Also, please find attached image to clarify the requirement.

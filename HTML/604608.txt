Hello.
I'm having difficulty using 2 dx-date-box components, and making range rules between them.
Use devextreme with angular 5
There are two different situations. In the first, the user will inform a date in the first component, and in the second component he can only select the date within the month set in the first component.
In the second situation, the user will enter a date in the first component, and in the second it will only be able to choose a date in the same year selected in the first component.
I started to build something like this:
<div class = "dx-field">
      <div class = "dx-field-label"> Start Date </ div>
      <div class = "dx-field-value">
        <dx-date-box # start_date [(value)] = "currentDate"> </ dx-date-box>
      </ div>
    </ div>
    
    <div class = "dx-field">
      <div class = "dx-field-label"> Final Date </ div>
      <div class = "dx-field-value">
        <dx-date-box #data_fim [(max)] = "maxDate"> </ dx-date-box>
      </ div>
    </ div>
And in the component.ts:
currentDate = new Date ();
maxDate = new Date (this.currentDate.getFullYear (), this.currentDate.getMonth () + 1, 0);
At component startup, the maxDate method works by limiting the date of the second component to only access within the started month.
However, by changing the value of the first component, it changes the value of [(value)] = "currentDate" by doing the two-way data binding of the angle, but maxDate does not receive this updated value, and does not exchange maxDate.
Could you help me on how to do this range between 2 dx-date-box?
I know it has a date range own component, but the client I find confusing to the general public, so it has to be between 2 dx-date-box even.

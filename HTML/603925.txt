Hello ,
I have updated version 17.2.3 to version 17.2.5
Still facing problem with filter criteria. I have to use adddays function in criteria this way .
 AddDays(Property, Days)
but i have typed property so days field should be like this AddDays(Property, TypedProperty.Days)
criteria doesn't accept this way of usage.
you can see error in attached screenshots

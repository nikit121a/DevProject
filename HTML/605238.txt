I have a - unfortunately very urgent - issue to report.
I'm using domain components in one of my projects and found a NullReferenceException during my tests.
The issue occurs if you log in with a non-administrator user where during loading of an object with an aggregated list of other business objects (in my example project and order) ServerPermissionRequestProcessor.GetSelectMemberCriteriaCore tries to find the member Implicit_IProject_Orders on IProject which it doesn't find. I tried to track down the origin of that membername and found that higher in the call stack the member must stem from XPClassInfo butÂ ServerPermissionRequestProcessor.GetSelectMemberCriteriaCore tries to find it on ITypeInfo.
I have created a test project with the minimum steps of
1) create xaf web project with complex security (integrated), XPO, no additional modules
2) Create the 2 domain components IProject and IOrder
3) Run the application and let the database be created
4) login as admin, create a project with an order
5) give the default role read and navigate permissions for project and order
6) login as user => NullReferenceException
I'm on 17.2.4 but upgraded to 17.2.5 to check if the error is gone there but no success.
Here is the callstack of the nullreferenceexception before I rollback to 17.2.4 (a very time consuming process)
It's quite important for me to solve this very fast (workaround is ok for me as long as it doesn't have bad side effects). This project is under big pressure.
Thanks a lot!

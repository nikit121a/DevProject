Hi,
im currently working on an ASPxTreelist in Virtual mode and want to allow Drag & Drop.
So far everything is working fine, but i want to  restrict the possible locations of a node.
I want the nodes to be only droppable in the same level they are currently in.
Is there an option i?m missing?
Kind regards
Lucas

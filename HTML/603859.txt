Hi,
I've set up a .Net Core project and configured Devextreme with the help of this guide : 
However I'm not able to view any controls and I can't seem to figure out why? I'm attaching my project folder here. I have several controls inside the view at this location /Areas/Agency/Views/Dashboard/Index
Please help me understand what am I missing here.
Thanks,

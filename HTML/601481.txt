Hello,
I'm working on an GridControl with an GridView running in ServerMode per 
.
As described in the 
-Article, I tried to retreive the Value with the OperationCompleted-delegate, but it doesn't get called.
Is there any Way to retreive the visible Rows Keys that doesn't need to load the full Objects from the Queryable-Source?
My current (not working) Code is the following: 
I've another piece of code that iterates the Grid-Handles and forces the Grid to load the Objects. But I can't use this since it's too slow and needs to load the whole Objects anyway.
I made it to get the visible Entity Ids by using the DevExpress internal classes.
1. Can I get the IDs without additional queries? 
    I think the current way how I obtained the ids isn't very good, since the LinqServerModeCore runs multiple queries    
2. Can I get the IDs with applying the GridView's Column-Sortings?
    Since the user will use the IDs in the order like displayed in the grid, it's required to get them as display.
Thank you in advance for your efford.
Now I made it to get the IDs in the correct Order, depending on the current Filters and Sortings made in the GridView.
I get the IDs in the correct Order with applied Filtering. Everything behaves same as the GridView. 
I'm stuck at applying the GridViews groupings to my IQueryable-Source.

I've tried to merge several OperandProperties with CriteriaOperator.And() but it gives me an Exception while converting it to an Expression.
Thank you in advance for your efford.

Hello,
Before the question I'll ask in the end, let me talk what happened to me using XAF, so it justifies why I need to change the form OIDs are generated and also hopefully your engineers do something to fix this problem out of the box.
Here is:
========================
I was always fighting about why my XAF database is kinda slow, sufering to add 1000 lines of data by taking 50s to accomplish that.
Wonder how my customers complained with me saying that is unacceptable.
I agree with them, even with those who have abandoned me because of this.
After  too many hours wasted to create workarounds to mitigate this and get some breath, finally I got a time to investigate this problem deeper.
Result:
** The problem is everything to do with OIDs being GUIDs (with inserts at least) **
After discovered this problem, I got to research over Web, and now I found several articles saying that, even with a real nice solution, which I share here for the posterity (I resumed to the ones I found most important in this case):
 <-- ***this one is very detailed and useful
In my tests, without tweeking anything else in database, I went from 50s to **0s** to insert 1000 records into database.
Zero seconds. Amazing.
Now I think my business cell which is all set with XAF has a better chance to succeed.Â 
====================
After the explained, I ask you:
How can I change my DCs to completely use CombGuids?
I say completely, because I've tried to use AfterConstruction() method, but then I noticed I have implicit object relations which I don't have control over the generated OIDs

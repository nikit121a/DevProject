Hi,
I want to use XAF as a new frontend for a legacy database.
I already figured out how to map an existing intermediate table for many-to-many relations by using UseAssociationNameAsIntermediateTableName-Attribute.
My existing intermediate table (MyTaskPerson) has the following structure:
Id = [PK, Autoincrement, bigint]
PersonId = FK for Person
TaskId = FK for Person
XAF tries to generate an OID PK for the intermediate table which throws an exeption because there is already an PK and we cannot declare two,
Is it necessary to use the OID instead of my already existing bigint PK?
Regards

Hello Svetlana,
we used your "At the same time, the 
 mechanism still allows you to apply the 
 operator to the necessary columns by setting the 
 property to Like and the 
 property to DisplayText."
it works but any other expression column that depends in its calculations to a column changed to FilterMode=DisplayText , gives #Err   
we are using 17.1.6
what can we do ?
thanks
Bassam

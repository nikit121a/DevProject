Hi guys,
I am wondering how to do this.Â  I have a property in my app called LengthOfTime, of type TimeSpan.
00:00:00
I only want the user to be able to enter the "Seconds" of this TextEdit. or SpinEdit.
For instance, if the user clicks in the box and types 14, it will display, "00:00:14"
They can only enter between 0 and 60.
How can I do this and would you have a sample of how to do this?
Thanks much.

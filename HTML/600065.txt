Hi support team,
when setting DevExpress.ExpressApp.Web.Editors.ASPx.ASPxGridListEditor.UseASPxGridViewDataSpecificColumns = false it seems that enum localization does not work correctly. In list view it works as expected, but as soon as you group by an enum column it doesn't work.
Please let me know what is wrong here.
I have attached a sample project where you can try to group by column "Priorit?t".
Thanks and regards,
Michael

Dear All,
I'm missing the "Group row popup menu" on the  TcxGridPopupMenu.
I have a grid with 2 group footer summary columns and I will select the current summary for sorting via the "Group row popup menu" by rightclicking on the group row.
But the "Group row popup menu" dosent invoke. Im wondering, because normaly this works very well. Was there any changes in the last time?
Please find attached a simple test project.
Tanks

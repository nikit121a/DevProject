Hi,
i am porting a WinForms desktop aplication to a more touch enabled UI and am using the Skin from your DemoCenters HypridApp.
My problem is the onscreen keyboard. 
The keyboard does not pop out when a textbox is entered; this is ugly, but acceptable.
More important: When the keyboard is visible, the screen does not scroll up and the keyboard hides the textbox, the only place i'd needed this, is in your DataLayoutControl. 
Do newer versions of this control have an automatism to handle keyboard and window behaviour?
If not, what is your advice to do this?
Regards

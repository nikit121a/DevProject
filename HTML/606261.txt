Hello,
I would like to manage every events in my scheduler as they are single event despite of they are part of a recurrence.
This means:
- Avoid to show the "Open recurring item" dialog and open the starnbdard edit dialog event as default.
- Remove the "edit series" from the pop-up scheduler men?
Disable or remove any other action or dialog that refer to a recurrence.
How is it possible?
Thank you,
Davide

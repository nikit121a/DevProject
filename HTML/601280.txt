Dear support,
I got a question on the GridView control.
How do I get the value of a control which sits in a DataItemTemplate , in an event like a button click (but no button in the grid or a grid-event)?
For example my GridView:
I have now in my webpage a button which fires a server-event (regular ASP.NET button). And in that button, I wanna know if the checkbox was checked or not.
With a regular ASP.NET Gridview I could now do something very easy like:
And then checking for each row if "chk" is checked or not.
However, I can't find anything similar in the DevExpress Gridview.
I know that there's the function FindRowCellTemplateControl but that function returns the checkbox always in state false (unchecked) even if it was checked. 
Seems like the DevExpress does not save anything in the ASP.NET Viewstate? 
I already tried rebinding everything in the Page_Load (without the function FindRowCellTemplateControl or even GetRow would always return null) but of course that doesn't help because after the rebind the states of the controls get refreshed.
Is there any way to get the correct checked state of my control? 
I can'tÂ imagine that DevExpress GridView can't do something that easy.
Thanks very much,
Sebastian

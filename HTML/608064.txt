Hi there,
I have already created many reports using xtrareports.
I have used formatting rule to conditionally hide band/controls.
Now you have introduce Expression Binding from 17.2.
hence I tried to used it but Expression editor doesn't display for visible property of xrLabel.
Please refer attached screenshot.
Do I need any specific setting?

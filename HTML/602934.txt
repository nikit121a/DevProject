I seem to have hit a wall to get my scheduler to work using FetchAppointment delegate and a checkboxList to filter resources. I am following E4717  and  E4130.
In the case of "filtering resources via checkbox list " the code example shows the following
That works fine for filtering the displayed resource calendar but it seems to not trigger the FetchAppointment delegate and my appointments all disappear on any callback.
Meanwhile in the "how to implement Fetch" example, the suggested code is
This works great to maintain the appointments across all callbacks but the filtering resources functionality is lost.
How can get both to work at the same time?

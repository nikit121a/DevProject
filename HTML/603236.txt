Hi, 
I was wondering if it's possible to customize a little bit more the doughnut's tooltip content (you can see my screenshot)  ?
I can see the content is directly injected in the svg . 
I cannot add html or css except font size et weight.  I would like to fluff up the content.
can you help me ?
Best regards

Hello,
I'm using your RatingEdit Â to define an evaluation  on an item (from 1 to 5)
By defaut, each item has its own value.
I would like to set a specific color or geometry on the RatingItem  for this value.
After looking in code-behind or in triggers, I don't find way a way to get a specific RatingItem to change that.
Dependency property 'Value' should be applied only on first RatingItem and no property on RatingEdit to get items.
Is it possible ? If yes, any suggestion ?
Thanks in advance 
Johan

Hi,
I get a null ref exception when running this code : 
The Exception points to the RefreshDataSource()
It seems to happen often then the computer have been left for a while.
I can?t see how gridAkut could be NULL so the null ref exception is probably thrown from a event that I have custom code in. The problem is however to see what methods that might be. I have checked your doc and can?t find any information about what "submethods" that vill be triggered.
Some of the methods Im listening on is : 
-Disposed
-Paint
-CustomColumnGroup
-CustomDrawGroupRow
-CustomDrawFooter
-CustomRowFilter
-CustomColumnSort
-GroupRowCollapsing
-EndGrouping
-DragDrop
-DragOver
-MouseDown
-MouseMove
-ShowingEditor
-ShowingEditor
 -FocusedRowChanged
- PopupClosed
-RowCellStyle
-CustomUnboundColumnData
-HiddenEditor
-GiveFeedback
The stackstrace is something like this : 
-Control.MarshaleInvoke 
-Control.Invoke
-WindowsFormSynchronizationContext.Send
-Controller.SendToUIThread
-Akutlista.UpdateGridThread() Â 
-ThreadHelper.ThreadStart_Context 
- ExecutionContext.RunInternal
-ExecutionContext.Run
BestRegards

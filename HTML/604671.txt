Hi,
I tried to hide the following menus:
 e.Menu.RemoveMenuItem(RichEditCommandId.NewComment);
 e.Menu.RemoveMenuItem(RichEditCommandId.NextComment);
It didn't work, so I figure out that the ID's are not matching which are in the Menu list.
 RichEditCommandId.NewComment value is 335
 RichEditCommandId.NextComment value is 341
But when I use these numbers than it works:
e.Menu.RemoveMenuItem(new RichEditCommandId(359));
e.Menu.RemoveMenuItem(new RichEditCommandId(360));
Am I correct or do I something wrong?
Tx,
Sung

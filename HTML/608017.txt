I have a TreeList with multiple columns. I would like to move my focus to the next cell when I press the TAB key. How do I achieve this?
I have tried to use the PreviewKeyDown event, but haven't come up with a proper solution yet.
Please remark that i use the 15.1 build. I have attached a picture, that shows how my treelist is structured.Â 
Best regards,
Perfion

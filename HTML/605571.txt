I had a display bug. If the page is without scrolling (the height of the table is less than the height of the screen) it will display correctly and if the page appears scrolling the last column will be shift and if there is data it won't be visible. The same bug is observed not only in the tables but also in the other widgets.Â 
i found only the one solution with refresh after define time interval but i think it's not good enough.

Hi,
I translated all function names and put then  to my unit, see sample below.
It mostly works. The problem is with BOOLEAN constants. When I put 
 to a cell and press ENTER it changes to 
 (centered in a cell). Now when I edit it (text TRUE) it is treated as string. Where to translate to be able to see my translated text instead of English source?

Hi,
Today we found a issue with the fix point fromat of the number box widget. You can reproduce it with the demo on your homepage (Editors/Number box/Formatting).
Steps to reproduce:
1.) delete the default value (13,415.24)
2.) type 15 into the field
3.) leave the input field
4.) give the field the focus
5.) try to delete the value with backspace
Now you can on delete until the point the 15 is not possible with backspace.

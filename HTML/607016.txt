Hi,
I've created a user control for editing some details of an object. Most of the time I use the black theme als in Visual Studio in my applications. But the RichEditControls that I use to enter a larger description stay white, while all other edit and dropdown boxes adapt to the theme.
Is ther e a way to make the RichEditControls adapt to the theme?
Thanks in advance,
Ronald

Hi, i'm having issues with a functionality i'd wish to implement.
I've got a master-detail gridview.
The detail view displays the exact same fields of the master view.
I'd like to implement a functionality allowing to filter from the header of the master view and allowing to check in the corresponding field of the detail rows, displaying:
The master rows fulfulling directly the filter criteria
OR
The master rows whose at least one detail view row fulfills the filter criteria.
I was thinking about using the FilterPopUpCheckedList and maybe manipulate it to add the detail values but i noticed on the documentation that adding items is not allowed.
Is there any other functionality allowing this? FilterRow maybe? What should be the appropriate events to handle to obtain that?
Thanks in advance!

Question re: property grid and property definitions ...
I have an existing database system that uses a character for essentially a BOOLEAN field.  It is filled with either 'Y' or 'N' to represent true/false.  When it comes to using the PropertyGrid to edit a record in this database, it would be nice to utilize a checkbox editor instead of a text editor.  I have a value converter already written for this.  Is there any way I could force a checkbox editor for this field, and then use an IValueConvert with a propertydefinition to convert the True/False back to a Y/N?

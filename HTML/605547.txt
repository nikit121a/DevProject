Hi!
We have  a GridControl bound to a XPCollection of XPO Entity (Oracle table 'Import_Mapping').
One column is bound to a firm using Combobox. 
A second column shall be bound to contacts, using Combobox, too.
The problem is that depending on the selected firm, the list of available contacts must be build.
We could implement that for visibility with GridColumn.CellTemplate, but we cannot change and store the contact.
How to do that? How to define the EditTemplate?

Hi, 
I have 2 questions about PdfViewerControl:
1) is it possible to overwrite the ShowSaveDocumentButton function with its own save function?
Background: I have a MemoryStream with a PDF document. The presentation in the PdfViewerControl works as far as possible. When saving the PDF document via the PdfViewerControl, the saved PDF document has a size of 849 KB. This is very much for a DIN-A4 page with little text.
I save the MemoryStream via a stream directly to a file, the PDF document has only a size of 69 KB.
2) How do I hide the Fit-page-level buttons?
Thank you,
Stephan

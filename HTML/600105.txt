Hello,
Consider toolbar in attached picture. 
A toolbar contains a BarCheckItem (Enable Radio Group).
There are BarCheckItems as radio buttons grouped with BarBaseButtonItem.GroupIndex Property (func1, func2, func3).
3 questions:
2. Would it be possible to enable the disabled group by clicking on a disabled radio button?
Thank you for support.

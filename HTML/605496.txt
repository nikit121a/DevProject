Hi,
I have a BootstrapPolarChart and I am trying to set a min and max for the axis. I have done this for normal line/bar charts
by adding a axis to valueaxiscollection but it doesn't seem to have one.  It does have a strip collection I added a strip with startvalue and
endvalue but it doesn't work. 
Is this possible?
Kind Regards,
Heijmen

Hello guys,
I have a table with some lines. I want  to have possibility to choose several lines by clicking to the lines themselves.
Currently I can do this just by clicking to the selection checkboxes, but I want the same functionality by clicking the lines themselves.
How can I do this?
Please see  attache image.
PS: I use Angular 4 and DevExtreme (HTML JS).
Thanks,
Paolo

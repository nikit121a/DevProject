Hi,
I have a protected worksheet with some cells unlocked. When I copy some cells range form Excel and paste it to any unlocked cell in my dxSpreadSheet, all cells are copied, also these which are pasted to locked cells.
In such situation Excel forbids pasting what is an expected behavior.
Steps to reproduce bug:
1) prepare a protected sheet where a single cell will be unlocked (editable).
2) copy some range (more than a single cell) form other Excel file
3) paste copied data to this single unlocked cell in a dxSpreadSheet.
4) see when a locked cells content is replaced too.

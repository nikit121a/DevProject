I have attached a sample that contains a dummy select Statement with 3 lines.
The report shows a table with 3 columns:
- a number
- a Picture (the property Keep Together=true)
- and a rich text 
If the rich text contains text that exceeds the length of a page, the picture is split although pictures property "Keep Together" is set to true.
Do you know how I can tell the report to show pictures together?

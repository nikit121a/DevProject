Hello,
Im using an ASPxPivotGrid and I would like to a 'custom' totals for parts of my rows.
For example , I have the following data rows ;
13
28 
10
7
18
34 
109 
368
I would like to get multiple totals (preferably at the bottom of the grid , which sums up the first 4 rows (and show that as total) and the last 4 rows (and show that as total).
The general idea is that I can get the sum of integers for between specific times (please see my screenshot)
Please advise.
Thnks.
Br,
Richard

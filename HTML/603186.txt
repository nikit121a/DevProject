I was wondering if I can enter items into an ASPxGridLookup control that are not contained in the underlying datasource and prevent the control from clearing them.
In my application, I'm trying to provide the user a multi-select multi-column dropdown list of email addresses.  I would like to allow the user to search and choose multiple items from the list, but ALSO enter an email address "freehand".
Let's say I have the following data in my aspxgridlookup:
Email/Company/Type
 aaa@test.com, aaa corporation, customer email
bbb@test.com, bbb corporation, vendor email
 ccc@test.com, ccc corporation, employee email 
My control now properly says:
aaa@test.com; ccc@test.com
If the user were to add:
;ddd@test.com
at the end of the string which is not in the list, the "ddd" entry is rejected and cleared because it is not in the lookup.  I would like to allow the user to multi select AND add entries not in the list.
The aspxCombo Box in DropDown style is close, but does not allow multiselect like the aspxGridLookup does.

Hi,
when you copy cell form excel to dxSpreadSheet it copies also Locked property when the source cell is formatted (i.e. bold). 
So when the destination Sheet  (id dxSpreadSheet) is protected and one copies cell to unlocked cell it becomes locked (non editable).
- it happens only when source cell has any format on it (not default one). 
Steps to reproduce:
1) prepare in Excel a sheet with some cell range unlocked.
2) enable protection in this sheet.
3) save it for future use as dst.xlsx
4) prepare application with dxSpreadSheet on it
5) run application and load prepared dst.xlsx file
6) open new excel put some value to A1, make it bold (or apply any other formatting)
7) copy this cell
8) paste this cell on SpreadSheet in your application to any unlocked cell
9) try to edit this cell - it now is not editable - the default locked state was copied (and it was set)
Excel in such situation leaves this cell Editable - discards locked value from source cell.

Good Morning:
I am using the Treelist as an outliner.  My Treelist has a ParentID column which is SortIndex 0.  It also has a Display Order column which is sortindex 1
Problem:  I want to be able to promote a child node to the root note list --- which has no value on the ParentID. My attached Initial State screenshot shows the treelist before I attempt to promote a child.  So I edit the ParentID column by deleting the ParentID and leaving it blank.  See Editing Screenshot.  My expectation was that the edited node would assume its position as a top level node.    This does not work.  The Edit update adds back the original ParentID and the node (understandably) goes nowhere. See After Edit Update Screenshot.  Now things get real interesting.  If I Edit ParentID to 1 (there is no Node with a PointID of 1)  The update reflects the "1" but leaves the node where it was.  See Change Parent ID to 1 screenshot.  So I infer that the AspxTreeList is maintaining an invisible sort order list.    However, if I change ParentId to an existing top level node ID,  the Node gets moved to become a child of the newly designated top level node.  See Changing Parent ID to Existing PArentID and Result of Changing Parent ID to Existing.
Will you help me to understand what is going on behind the scenes and how I can edit a node to promote a child to the top level node collection?  Thanks!

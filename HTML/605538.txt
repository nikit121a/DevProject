Hi, I have a search panel in my gridview.
If I search for some text and leave my page, when I come back using the browser's back button I find the gridview not filtered and the search panel containing the text previosly searched.
This would not be a problem, but if I type another text or if a try to clear the panel, an error occours.
what is the best approach to avoid this behavior?
you can find attached an example.
Thank you as always for your support.
Max

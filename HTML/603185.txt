Another question on ASPxTreeList: for using the CustomDataCallback function and the ASPxClientTreeListCustomDataCallbackEventArgs, I need the NameSpace DevExpress.Web.ASPxTreeList.Scripts.
Trying to add a reference to this NameSpace, it's not in the list (see attached image).
How to solve this small problem?
Thanks in advance!

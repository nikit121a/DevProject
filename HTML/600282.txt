When I am on the web, I can scroll both horizontally and vertically using only my mouse wheel.
Wheel up/down -> vertical
Wheel left/right -> horizontal
However, this does not seem to work on dxDataGrid for the horizontal scrolling.
When wheel left/right, result is vertical scroll instad of horizontal.
Is there any way to scroll horizontally using wheel left/right?

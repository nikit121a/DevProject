Hello
 Looks like behavior of a grid editor is not correct in this case:
- multi selection is enabled for  the grid;
- cell select mode;
- EditorShowMode == Click;
- button or combo cell editor.
First click in a cell make it selected and a button is shown - all is correct. 
 Then click on the button selects all the text instead of showing a drop down list (or time, color ... picker).
 You can see it in XtraGrid Suite demo you supplied with the components, the screenshot is attached.
Is it possible to make the button work  with the first click on it in "Click" EditorShowMode?
 Best regards,
Oleksii

Hello, 
In my WPF application, non-MVVM, I have a Window and code behind:
The mouse switches to the blue spinning wheel on click, but it's frozen in place. I can't move the mouse, keyboard is stuck (no Ctrl+Alt+Delete), etc. Once the event is done, I can move all throughout the app/OS. Any thoughts on what is happening? 
I did try a BackgroundWorker(), but it won't fire the UpdateData() command.

I have managed to successfully customize the popup form that is used to edit a row on a datagrid.  This form does show all the fields that are present in the grid, and that is all good.
The form allows the user to edit the properties of a Project  object, BUT I also need to show a grid at the bottom of the form which allows the user to edit the list of users that have access to that Project.  This "sub" datagrid will only allow adding and deleting in batch mode.
How can I add this datagrid and a label for it at the bottom of the edit popup form?

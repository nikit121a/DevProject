I have the following progress bar in Angular 4
 <dx-progress-bar 
            [min]="0" [max]="progress_total" [statusFormat]="overallProgressFormat" [value]="progress_counted">
 </dx-progress-bar>
It shows the 'loading' animation when the page is loading and then when the page is loaded it retains the animation but shows the bar that I expect to see directly under it (see attachment).
I can't find a way to make it behave normally.

Hi DevExpress Team,
I have a project that builds successfully with WPF v14.2 on Win7 Service Pack 1 under Visual Studio 2015, and here're the DLLs used.
DevExpress.Charts.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Data.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Mvvm.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Printing.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Charts.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Controls.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Core.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Docking.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Grid.v14.2.Extensions.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Layout.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.LayoutControl.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Printing.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Printing.v14.2.Service.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Ribbon.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Xpf.Themes.Office2010Black.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.XtraPrinting.v14.2.dl
In project references, I manually changed reference to these four
DevExpress.Charts.v14.2.Core.dll
DevExpress.Data.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Mvvm.v14.2.dll
DevExpress.Printing.v14.2.Core.dll
to reference their v17.1 counterparties, and the build fails with errors like these two
Error CS0012 The type 'ColumnSortOrder' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'DevExpress.Data.v14.2, Version=14.2.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b88d1754d700e49a'. 
Error CS0012 The type 'SummaryItemType' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'DevExpress.Data.v14.2, Version=14.2.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b88d1754d700e49a'. 
besides, I got LINQ related errors like this one
Error CS1061 'string' does not contain a definition for 'IsEmpty' and no extension method 'IsEmpty' accepting a first argument of type 'string' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) 
So I gave up manual upgrade to v17.1 and ran  Project Conveter in VS 2015 to upgrade to v17.1 and got same kinds of errors.
Do you have similar reported issues? Any suggestions are appreciated.
Thank you,
Bill Rong

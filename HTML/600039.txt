Hello,
Consider toolbar in attached picture. 
A toolbar contains a BarCheckItem (Enable Radio Group).
There are BarCheckItems as radio buttons grouped with BarBaseButtonItem.GroupIndex Property (func1, func2, func3).
3 questions:
1. What is the smartest way to enable radio buttons with  BarCheckItem (Enable Radio Group)?
2. Would it be possible to enable the disabled group by clicking on a disabled radio button?
3. Avoiding "Enable Radio Group" check, would it be possible to uncheck all radio buttons?
Thank you for support.

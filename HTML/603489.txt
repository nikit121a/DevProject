Hi Team,
We have a popup with a combobox and one grid. The grid data is based on the combobox selection.  
Currently we have given the autopostback true for the combobox. 
so whenever we select an item in the combobox it performs a postback and fills the grid.
 Our issue is like, when this postback happens the popup vanishes and reappears. How can we handle this situation. PFA , which explains the issue better than words.
 Thanks in advance!

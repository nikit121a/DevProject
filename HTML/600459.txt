We need to show PopupContainerControl, when user is editing text in PopupContainerEdit. Focus has to be in PopupContainerEdit to don`t interrupt user input.   
After update to 17.2.5, the code we were using  before, stopped to work. The PopupContainerControl  is closing when focus moved to PopupContainerEdit. 
How to keep focus in PopupContainerEdit and have PopupContainerControl opened, while user is typing.
Please have a look at attached example.
Thank you.

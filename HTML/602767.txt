I'm looking at the ASPxCalendar control here :
.
I was wondering how I can have the control look like that.
I want to remove the borders and have a bit of separation between the months  (I've attached how I want it to look like (Capture.png)).
Another question, is there a way to decrease the font (or the overall size of the control).
In 1 column, 2 rows mode using my screen, the control isn't fully appearing (attached screenshot : MyScreen.png).

Bilal

Hello:
Please see sample here:
1) On click of change button, I'm trying to set the itemOption as below:
it does not like the space in the "Group Two".
2) However, if I just change the "Group Two" to "GroupTwo" and still keep the space in the "Country info", it does work.
So, how would I set itemOption when the captions/titles contain spaces and why is the behavior different?
3) Ideally, I would like to set the itemOption using the dataField name and not by the captions/titles.. Is there an option for this??
Thanks!

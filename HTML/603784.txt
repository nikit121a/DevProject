If a user has a cell with a formula that results in a TRUE value or a FALSE value then copying and pasting that cell will result in an error on Excel. The error is a  "Problem During Load" with the Table.
To reproduce the problem do the following:
1. Open the VCL demo application
2. Enter "=TRUE" into a cell without the inverted commas.
3. Copy the cell
4. Paste the cell into Excel
The problem is happening because in TdxSpreadSheetXMLSSWriter.WriteCellData, there is no condition to handle boolean values so they get written as "True" or "False". Excel expects a 1 or 0 here for the value of the cell.

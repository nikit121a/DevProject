Hi,
i rotated a XYDiagram with two panes because i needed a horizontal  bar in the bottom pane.
Now the points in the upper pane seems to be sorted wrong, see the attached screeneshot.
How can i make the line go left to right again?
Edit: The points are in the right place, it is just the line thats going top to bottom

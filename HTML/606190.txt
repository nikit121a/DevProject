Since i updated my DevExpress from version 17.1.2 to version 17.2.4 i get a memoryleak in cxControls.
The leak appears if you have a grid and just scroll up and down with the new introduced scrollbars.
If i set theTouchScrollUIMode property of a LookAndFeelController to FALSE the leaks are gone.
I attach a  simple projekt to reproduce the leak. Just run the program an scroll up and down.
In the attached archive i also uploaded the reported leak report from MadExcept.

Narrator does not read the selected TrackBarControl 
 
It only announces "Thumb".
 
It makes it impossible for someone visually impaired to manipulate  the "Trackbar Control"
I tried to set the Accessibility Name which works on all the other  controls.
 
Repro steps
1. Create a DevExpress WinForm
2. Create a TrackBarControl 
3.Compile and run 
4. Run Narrator
5. Set Focus to the TrackBarControl 
I can upload a sample but the above steps should make it simple enough.
 
Thank you,

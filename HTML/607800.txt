Hi, Guys
I dont know if this happens just because i am using your trial version. 17.2.4 (Latest TRIAL) and DX 10.
I  am testing a CELL MERGED Column, and It shows pretty well in the cxGrid, but when i try to see it in the dxComponentPrinter or dxComponentPrinterLink it doesnt work.
for Example taTopJustify is working correctly in cxGrid with Cell Merge, but when you print it from the same cxGrid, then taTopJustify is ignored and taCenter is used.   
 ?
Regards
Karlin

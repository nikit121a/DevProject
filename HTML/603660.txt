Hi,
Previously we had a dashboard connected to SQL server using stored procedure with parameters passed to procedure . Now we are moving to OLAP cube for the same dashboard. I have some questions
 1)  we have 4 dashboard items; 2 bar charts and 2 grids. 1 chart and 2 grids are loading based on the bar, the user clicks from the first barchart. For this  we have kept a hidden reportid. We kept an invisible parameter through which we were passing the reportid for last 3 item's stored proc using the clientside item click.
is there any way we can add reportid also along with the value ?
2) is there any way we can set hidden parameters and pass the reportid w hen the user clicks on the bar to the cube to filter the data.
3) is there any way to filter the cube data based on another 4 par ameters? I was doing this previously by keeping invisible parameters and setting it's value through the dashboard loaded event.
4) will the master filtering work for the cube in the same way it works for normal dashboard?
Thank you
Veera

Hello,
I'm using DevExtreme.AspNet.Data package (version 1.3.0) to transform data on server before sending it to dxDataGrid on frontend.
Currently I need to implement custom summary type for string columns and the problem is that DevExtreme.AspNet.Data does not support custom aggregators.
I've looked at library sources and found that summary types are hardcoded although there is an internal abstract class Aggregator. 
I've also found the same question on github: 
Do you plan to support custom aggregators in DevExtreme.AspNet.Data and when?

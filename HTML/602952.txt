Sorry to barge in on someone else's Q but why does EndlessPaging require a client-side solution? Is it completely impossible to set the FocusRowIndex to a value (say 1) when using EndlessPaging? I choose 1 because there will be at least 2 (or more then likely) rows.
 The 
 for MakeRowVisible makes it clear it doesn't work with EndlessPaging. But 
 makes no mention of this.
cheers!

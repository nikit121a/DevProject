Hi
I have a lookupedit that is loaded from the database with for example VALUE1
Then I change the dropdown list and remove VALUE1 from available values
When the user loads the grid, the column using a RepositoryItemLookUpEdit   will show an empty cell since the value is VALUE1 but the dropdown does not have VALUE1 anymore
I dont necessarealy want users to be able to add new items but since it is already inputted, I would like to show them the current "wrong" value and not an empty value.
I tried with repo.AcceptEditorTextAsNewValueÂ  but this is only for newly typed values.
In my case the column comes from a table and ALREADY have the invalid value.
What would be the best approach to let the user see the current value ?

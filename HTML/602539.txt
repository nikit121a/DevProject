Hello,
in my xaf application module I have a custom CloneController that inherits from CloneObjectViewController.
Now I have added the mobile module, so when I try to start mobile application I have this error:
It seems that in mobile application there is the MobileCloneObjectViewController that inhertis from  CloneObjectViewController, so there are 2 controllers that inherit fromÂ CloneObjectViewController. How can I solve this, in xaf mobile app?
Thank you

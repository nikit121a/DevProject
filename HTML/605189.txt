I've recently upgraded from v16 to v17.4 and I'm receiving numerous exception reports from different users, clearly related to the DevExpress components. These exceptions seem random and affect different users, with no clear way to reproduce them.
The intention of this message double:
1. To provide DevExpress with any piece of feedback that may lead to solving these problems, even when it's not very specific
2. Ask for some kind of general solution to catch these exceptions and gather better information about the scenario.
I was thinking of having a chart, grid and pivotgrid descendant that may catch these exceptions, log them in more detail and be able to reload itself, since the reports I get are sent when my whole app crashes.
Here are excerpts of several exceptions I've received in the past week (I have more trace information on each one of them, but I think that the relevant parts are what I paste below):

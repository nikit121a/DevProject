Is it possible to add a PropertyEditor to a DashboardView?
I've tried this, but the issue appears to be that a DashboardView doesn't target a specific business object, and so in the Model the properties of the property editor cannot be correctly populated.
My goal is to create a dropdown in the Dashboard where I can use a LookupListView to select an object of Type "Store", similar to how I would in a DetailView.Â  If I can't use a property editor for that, is there a similar controller I can add via a ControlDetailItem on the Dashboard?

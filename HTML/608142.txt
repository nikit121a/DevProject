I am facing an issue with the PopupContainerEdit+PopupContainerControl controls.
I have a Form (MDI Container) that has the "TopMost" property set to "True" .
Inside that form, i have a simple Form (MDI Child) which contains a PopupContainerEdit+PopupContainerControl .
When i want to open de Popup, it shows behind the MDI container (because it is set to TopMost=True).
So, i figured i could just set the MDI container TopMost=False when showing the  PopupContainerControl, and then, when i close it, set de MDI container back to TopMost=True.
This worked in DevExpress 16.2 . But when i upgrade to 17.2.5, the popup shows, then instantly hides. So it is unusable.
The MDI container needs to stay TopMost=True.
Would you have any solution ? 
I attached a sample project.

Dear DevExpress Support Team.
To the style of "dxb: BarButtonItemLinkControl" like below,
Is there a way to set multiple "dxmvvm: EventToCommand"?
I know how to use AssociatedObject of DevExpress.Mvvm.UI.Interactivity.Behavior and how to register multiple events in OnAttached / OnDetaching.
But, I am looking for another way.
 I want to process multiple events of "BarButtonItemLinkControl" with commands implemented in ViewModel.
BestRegards.

Hello there, I have yet again another issue with the MVVM framework that I need your expertise with.
We have a project with views and view models created by the WPF Scaffolding Wizard.
In the detail view / single object view for an entity, there are some (string) properties where we want to provide suggestions in a ComboBoxEdit or similar. These suggestions should be all distinct values that are used for this property.
In one case, we want those only as suggestions and the user is able to  enter a different value, in the other case the user can only choose from  those values. This should replace the standard text edit control generated for this strign property.
For example, if there are 4 entities of class Component with a property "Material", with 3 having material "Wood" and 1 having "Metal", we want a combo box containing the two entries "Wood" and "Metal".
I tried adding a LookUpMaterial property to my view model that returns the result of "GetLookUpProjectionsViewModel", following examples on 
, but the combobox was either empty or contained only one element. I could just use a List<String> that is a result of a simple LINQ query, but that didn't get updated when new values were added.
Thank you!

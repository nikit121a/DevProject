Hi Experts,
I have multiple placeholders in the WebPage that is loading user controls based upon the selection.
Usercontrols contains the chart control.
Based upon the selection, we need to load the user control in the place holder, there may be a different user control in the place holder at everytime.
It creates the strange issue.
Sometime the chart loaded into one place holder, loads the design attributes of other.
I am confused, why ??
Please help.
Thanks
Lalit Narayan

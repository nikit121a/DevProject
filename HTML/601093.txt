Let's consider a scenario when the chart's data is updated at realtime (e.g., using a timer) and the axis zooming option is enabled. When an end-user zooms in to see detailed data and then zooms out to the initial zoom level to see all points, the axis range is not reset to the automatic mode. This means that newly added points will not be visible by default and it will be necessary to perform the zoom out operation once again to see all points (including the newly created ones) or set the VisualRange.Auto property at runtime.
A more convenient behavior is to automatically enable the automatic range adjustment mode once an end-user sets the maximum zoom level.

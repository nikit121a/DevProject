Hi.
We had some users report that when their application windows occupied the entire desktop (but were not maximized), they couldn't click on their Windows taskbar buttons anymore.
Turns out the Bezier skin window shadow (on an MDI window at least) is not click-through.  You cannot click anything behind the shadow, which is quite a few pixels tall.  Other skins do not behave this way.
Thanks.

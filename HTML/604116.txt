Is there a way to view a PDF in the viewer, then open it in Adobe Acrobat, add markup and then save? When I do this, I get the attached error (the file is in use). I imagine that because the PDF is being viewed in the devexpress viewer, that it is "in use".
Is there any way around this? My users need full adobe features to markup documents, but ideally would be doing this from the devexpress viewer (using a button that opens the file in Adobe Acrobat).

The line number reported in the Code Issues list is 1 less than the line that contains the late bound call. For example, list shows:
(1233,20) Warning AA0001 : The call is late bound.
And the code is:
1233:
1234:     If (CompToCheck.TrackName = FirstTrackFound) And (Not LimitsChangeDetected) Then
No big thing. Haven't looked at the source to determine why. (Don't really care - the warning is more accurate and specific than my Awk code.)

We have a WebChartControl where we are using index values as arguments on the X-Axis.  Using the server-side CustomDrawAxisLabel event, we're replacing these numeric index arguments with more meaningful text strings as X Axis labels.  That all works fine.
The problem we're having is that the GroupHeader in the Crosshair displays the argument index  value rather than the text string we replaced it with in the X Axis label.  Is there a way to customize the Crosshair to use the Axis labels rather than the argument values in the GroupHeader?  I tried implementing the client-side CustomDrawCrosshair event to see if we could handle it that way, but I don't see that the custom Axis labels are available to us in that event.
BTW, we are only using index values as arguments on the X-Axis because we need to display labels for empty series.  I don't think that's possible using the Qualitative ScaleType.  If there's a way to maintain a position on the Axis for empty series using the Qualitative ScaleType, that would be the ideal solution.
Any assistance you might provide would be greatly appreciated. 
Best,
Jeff

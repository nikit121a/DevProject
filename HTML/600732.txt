We have a large grid that essentially provides two display sets. The left side has the ability for users to use the column chooser to add columns for detail. The right side displays the grid with the corresponding values related to each row. There is a scroll bar spanning the full-grid at the bottom, but the scroll bar only controls the values on the right. The left side with the column chooser ability is fixed. Is there a way to split these two sides to have their own individual scroll bars? A problem exists that if a user chooses too many columns, it pushes the right side to the edge of the screen and the values are no longer viewable since the left side can't be managed in the way we would like.

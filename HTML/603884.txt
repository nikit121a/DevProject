Hi Guys,
my problem is when I have built a treeview using virtual mode, clicking on the node causes an error.
I have attached a pared down version of my code. The error only happens on clicking the node text, clicking plus or minus works as expected.
Server Error in '/' Application.
An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. 
System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'DevExpress.Web.Bootstrap.BootstrapTreeViewVirtualNode' to type 'DevExpress.Web.Bootstrap.BootstrapTreeViewNode'.

Hello support team,
I have a problem with a pretty trivial situation: There is a BarManager on the form. The menu bar has one sub menu (BarSubItem) with one sub button in this menu (BarButtonItem), e.g. File / Open. This item is set visible or hidden depending on user rights. When hidden I also want to hide the menu since it has no more visible sub items. How can I achieve this behaviour?
I tried (and it doesn't work): 
I also tried the 11 years old solution provided for this purpose in 
 (and it doesn't work as well):
Is there still no easier solution, e.g. a HideItemIfEmpty property?
Thank you!

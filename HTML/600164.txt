Dear support,
Please can you assist.  I am trying to find a way of setting "isEditable" to false at a cellular level.  I need this because I have a column where a specific cell in a column is only editable depending on the value of another datarow field.
I have searched tickets and found that using  
info.cellElement.find('input').prop('readonly',true)
in the cellprepared event stops a user from being able to edit the value, however the cell still simulates the edit cell function, which could be confusing.  I would prefer if it could behave like the column is set to isEditable: false.
Many thanks

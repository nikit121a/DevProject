Hy Supportteam,
i am currently testing easytest and recorded a simple script wtih logon and calling about action!
The Field Mandant in Logon DetailView is a LookUpEdit!
I always get the error:
Cannot change the 'Mandant' control's field value. The control is read only, line 5
How could i fill the Mandant Field?
Regards,
Niki

Hello,
I'm using a ChartControl in a WPF Project, I set all the properties in runtime. This is part of code
'variable chart is a DevExpress.Xpf.Charts.ChartControl
Dim diagrama As New XYDiagram2D()
            chart.Diagram = diagrama
            Dim series As New BarSideBySideSeries2D
            series.LabelsVisibility = True
            series.ColorEach = True
            series.ArgumentDataMember = "X"
            series.ValueDataMember = "Y"
            Dim sl As New SeriesLabel
            series.Label = sl
  
The problema is I cannot set the property of series LabelPosition.
Can you help me, please?
I have attached a image with the property in desing time. The others properties of the image, I can set in runtime.
Thank you very much.

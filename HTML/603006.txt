Hello, 
    In the sample application attached with this post, DevExpress::XtraBars::Ribbon::RibbonForm is used.
I am facing an issue with the form's title text. The ribbon form's title text disappears whenever the form is 
maximized and reappears when its size is changed from maximized state to a smaller size.
Thanks & Regards,
Georgy Daniel

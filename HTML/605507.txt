I've spent all day so far trying to achieve what frankly should be out of the box functionality!
I want to save a grid control's layout to a single file. End user's cannot be expected to save separate files for the main view and every detail view in the grid control.
I have worked through you documentation and dozens of posts dating back over six years  and I cannot this working.
Attached is a  modified sample of yours  where I'm trying to use the recommended method. I want it to work how the normal separate file export works but to create a single file.
The sample only contains 1 grid but this shouldn't matter to get it working.
Test steps
1: Run progam
2: Drag columns a, b, and c out of the grid (hiding them)
 3: Click the save button
4: Close and reopen program
5: Click the load button
6: See how the columns that should be hidden are not hidden but are moved.

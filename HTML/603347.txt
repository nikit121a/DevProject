Quick question  - 
I made a small Winforms application and in it I have the F1 - F12 keys set up via the DevExpress MVVM framework as hot keys for quickly inserting text into a memoedit control. 
Everything works great except for the following:
- The F2 key seems to have a default behavior in the memoedit where it selects all of the control's displayed text when pressed. I have checked your demos and the text edit, memo edit and memo ex edit all do this in the demos as well. I cannot find anything that says if this is a default feature of windows and/or winforms' base controls (I.E. Text Edit, Rich Text Box, etc). Do you know if there is a way to turn this feature off? 
Edit: I noticed there are a couple of other tickets where people suggested using the keydown event to suppress the F2 Key. However, I am afraid this will interfere with my MVVM binding to the F2 key and the memo edit. I'm not at my development machine right now to try this out, but if you see this before I get a chance to try it tomorrow night, please let me know if you think this will cause any issues with the MVVM bindings/commands. 
- When I press the F10 key, the program sets the focus on my bar/bar manager.  From what I have been able to find out, this is functionality thats baked into Windows. Again, I couldn't find any properties or settings on the bar/bar manager to disable this functionality. However,  I have found a way to override this behavior using Win32 API calls, but out of curiosity, is there anything that DevExpress provides that makes this easier?  I noticed there was a similar ticket for this regarding the ribbon, but I can't find anything regarding the bar/bar manager:

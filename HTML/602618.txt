Our grid does not allow word wrap and in our data grid when the data in a cell is too wide the ellipsis is displayed as expected.
However when the data in the cell is three characters or less under the ellipsis the hover over does not appear.
In the attached image, above the black bar the hover over is displaying as we expect it to.
Below the bar, the cell circled in red does not display the hover over, the remainder of the text is "17"Â

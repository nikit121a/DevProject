We do some autocapitalization in our AutoCorrect event handler, and a customer wants this functionality after an autocorrection has happened
For example, the desired behaviour is to both correct and capitalize "acheive" :
"Previous sentence. acheive" ->  "Previous sentence. Achieve "
but the AutoCorrect event does not seem toÂ fire after the table entry correction, so we can't do the capitalization 
"Previous sentence. acheive" -> "Previous sentence. achieve " 
Can AutoCorrect be configured for this behaviour?

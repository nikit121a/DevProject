Hi,
I need a function to read the specific cell clicked from a Pivot chart Â having multiple groups using GetUnderlyingData function
For Instance:
please take the pivot grid in the following example
if I click the cell having value of 204, it should return me these values
 
state = albama
category = bike wash
units sold = 204
etc.
so basically i need to know that which row and which column (along-with their parent group value i-e category in the example) was clicked.
 
Thanks

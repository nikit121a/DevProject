We are using your XtraCharts component to display data from a database. 
In that database there is a field which represents the time of day in seconds.Â 
This field is interpreted in the component, so the displayed value has a human readable format (hh:mm:ss). 
Is it possible to use this format when exporting the data via the export function provided by your component?

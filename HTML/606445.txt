Hi folks,
I'm trying to remove the "Template Report" Report Type from theÂ ChooseReportTypePage Wizard Page.
However, i do not know where to set the available/visible Report Types for my created CustomChooseReportTypePage Wizard Page.
Best,
Micha
P.S. Will ASPxReportDesigner support the "Template Report" Report Type in near future?

this is actually like a bug that was just appeared again in 16.2.12.
after my project conversion a dynamic grid got a timespan that was converting my xallues to a strange format
xxxxxxxxx.hhmm.ssssssssssss and i jsut wanted HH:mm.
this example helped find a work arround but i believe the team must look aout for this again.
my database type was time(0) or time (7) and it was still giving me an error when the bindingsource was doing update the Dataset.
please have a look at this again.
thanks

I'm trying to develop a new skin for our company. I'm getting there, but there are a couple items which I haven't figured out how to edit.
One of these is the BarHeader item for the Bars product. It uses the ColorScheme (or skin mask) color, and lightly colors the background of the BarHeader. I was able to find several help threads on how to custom draw this at runtime, but we don't want 100+ programmers to have to do this for every header Item. Rather, I want to be able to tell it in the Skin Editor (V2)  "Don't apply color".
I just can't seem to find what option in the editor controls this element.

Hello,
I am setting up a new theme using the ThemeBuilder and was successful at applying my theme. I think I followed all of the examples at:
However, when I try to switch to one of the built-in themes, nothing happens.
In my MainWindow() When I comment out
The theme drop down works and switches themes.  However, when I try to set my theme with the ThemeManager, it seems to break the built in themes.  When I use the ApplicationThemeHelper.ApplicationThemeName = "My Custom Theme" it seems to work.
Is this by-design, should I not use the ThemeManager.SetTheme() ?
 
Please advise.
Thanks much,
-Timothy

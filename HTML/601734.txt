Hi,
We got a hang in our Report DesignerÂ  when we are changing text alignment of a label ( or when changing the datamember of a detailed report band).
I read about a similar issue reported (see the link below), and I think we have the same issue.
There is a workaround suggested in that ticket, that I think does not work in our case for our report designer.
Can you please let me know if there is any workaround for this issue in report designer without updating our devex to a given hotfix version?
Thank you,
T?nde Zsigmond

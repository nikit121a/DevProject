Dear, Devexpress Support
In TcxTableView (e.g.) when use Column.PropertiesClassName = 'TcxLabelProperties', then setÂ TableView.DataController.FindFilterText.
In this case filtering is working but does not highlight text in this column. If  PropertiesClassName = 'TcxTextEditProperties' then filter text in column is highlited.
Is this behavior by design, or could be implemented?
We are using LabelProps for read-only columns, but need ability to filter with highlighting.
Best regards,
Anatoliy

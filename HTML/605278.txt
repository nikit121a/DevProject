	 	I have two user controls which include a ASPxGridViews.
I control the display on the user controls with a tab control.
When I click on the tabs; back and forth, the grid loose their databinding.
Run the default page, click on the Social Catering tab then click on the Order detail tab.
You will the see the databinding on the first control is lost.
I have include a sample website to demonstrate the problem.

Hi DevExpress !
I need to speed up the display of a LayoutControl with many controls.
In my application, the end-users can customize the LayoutControl at their convenience, and so, in the end, a lot of controls are actually hidden.
Generally, they do it once and for all and most of the time they use the customized layout.
So, the main idea is now to detect which layout items actually visible and to only restore (and generate edit controls) these ones.
Could you guide me in this task ?
Thank you.

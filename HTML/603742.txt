I have a dxSelectBox that uses the display text as its value. It must accept custom values that are entered. When a custom value is entered, an ajax call back to the server is fired to enter the value into a separate table, and return the new item. If it the ajax fails, it won't be entered into the table but I still need the custom value to be added to the dxSelectBox options and selected.
Here is a snippet from the method called by the OnCustomItemCreat ing event for the dxSelectBox:
Both the .done and .fail functions push a new item into the options, and reload the items for the SelectBox. However only the .done() function selects the item afterwards. If the callback fails, the new item is added to the options but isn't selected. The SelectBox is left with no value selected, however the newly added value can be selected afterwards from the options, but its another step.
What I need is for the custom item to be added and selected as the value, regardless of the result from the Ajax call. The "Name" property of the item is used as both the DisplayExpr and ValueExpr of the SelectBox.

Hi,
I have a few problems with the new search feature of aspxtreelist. 
First, If all nodes are collapsed and filter is applied, treelist only shows the most outer parent node of the search  result and child nodes are removed from the tree. The results can not be seen. However I want the treelist to expand to the show the search results. Search feature only works effectively if "AutoExpandAllNodes" is set to true which is not suitable for cases when tree has lots of elements.
Second, If I use client side export feature then search panel becomes disfunctional. I need to refresh the page in order to be able to use search panel again.
Is there any solution/workaround to these problems.

SaveLayoutToXml just seems to have the DataSource as #Ref-0.
This seems rather strange.
So in the ReportDesigner I override the default queries that I provide to the report which the actual ones I want to run using the SQL Datasource wizard.
Make changes to my document, get it all working and then save it to disk so I can then load it in the DocumentViewerControl elsewhere in the program.
Opening it in the document viewer from the repx file (LoadLayoutFromXml), there's no datasource though!Â  Queries are gone.
So, this can't be right, what am I doing wrong?

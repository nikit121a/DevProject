Hi,
A client of ours wants to use DevExpress Report Server for some reporting needs.
However, when they try to run the installer on the machine they want to install it on, nothing happens. No error or anything, it just refuses to run.
Their IT administrator says it most likely has something to do with their anti-virus setting. Is this something known to give problems with DevExpress installers? 
If so, is there any way for them to get around this so they can actually install the software?
Thanks in advance.

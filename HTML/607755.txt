I have the following routine to read Binary columns (BLOB) from an Oracle Database and concatenate the binary data into a Memory Stream and then open the Memory Stream using the ASPxRichEdit field.
Only the first column of Rich Text data is displayed in the RichEdit field.  Even though the Memory Stream length shows a total length for both columns.
The binary columns in the database include rich text data and can be opened individually using the Open method using a single binary column.

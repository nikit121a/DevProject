Hi,
The systems are a bit more diverse than specified in selection, as we are having issues in development and live, and we tested on VS2015 and 2017
Our product has 15.2 Winforms package installed. We recently upgrade from 15.1 to 15.2 (we are trying to avoid large updates to a stable product where necessary, hence we haven't moved to more recent versions, though 15.2.17 is a fairly recent release) .
15.1 did not have this issue.
When we open the Report Designer on our customer's installed application, our product crashes with the following stack trace.:
When we try this in the IDE we get a freeze.
I am aware of 
  that I found referenced in other posts (such as 
) but this is an old update now and refuses to install when I tried.
If needs be I can update to 16.2 (our latest available version), though this will be a pain in the rear as we have 5-6 integrated projects over 3 build servers that will all need to be updated, so I would prefer to avoid that.
I am also lobbying my boss to purchase a new licence ASAP to get newer versions if that is also a fix, though I can't see him being too impressed at being railroaded into that decision by a bug.
Many thanks in advance.

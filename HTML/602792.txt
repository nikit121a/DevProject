Hi
XRline Cotrol get shited from its original Position in report when some other label controls text contain "\r\n\r\n\r\n" ..
xrLabel1.Text = "Text with new line\r\n\r\n\r\n" 
xrLine1 supposeÂ  to show midle of graph, but its gets shifted from its original posion, but works fine with "\n" not there in  xrLabel1.Text.
PFA project.
Can you please explain in detail.
Regrads,
Amit

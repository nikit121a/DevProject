Hi,
In an angular JS application, is it possible to configure a rangeslider to have different colours.
For example, I would like a popup with 4 rangesliders with 4 different colours.....
I have a created a codepen which copies your demo but I can't find the setting to change the appear colour
Regards
Alan

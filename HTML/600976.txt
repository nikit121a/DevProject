Thank you, this has led me in the correct direction.  I've kind of got what I want sort of working, if it's ok I have just a couple of follow-on questions (maybe just clarifications from the documentation):
a) I'm confused by the documentation for the RepositoryItem structure.  In some places it states it applies to all controls of the same 'type' (e.g. if I change the settings it changes it for all of them), other places seem to indicate that each control has a local copy of the source.  I think it's the latter.  Long story short, is the only way to modify the behaviour accomplished by defining/manipulating a repositoryitem?  I've tried tweaking things in the constructor of the component itself (e.g. set specific properties in the constructor) but I seem to hit a timing issue where there is a properties object but it's not *the* properties object (e.g. the changes have no effect in the constructor but do have an effect in later code).

We're in the process of evaluating Dashboards for our application. The tool looks very nice but one thing I'm trying to figure out is if it's possible to only allow access to a specific schema in our database when the user builds a data source. The database that the user has access to is very large and the user shouldn't have access to probably 95% of it when creating dashboards. The simple solution would seem to be create a dashboard schema in the database that includes table, view and stored procedures that the user can include in their data source while hiding the rest of the database to them. Is this possible?

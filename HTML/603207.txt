In my application right now, I have controls which validates on Enter, but the cursor remains in the field.
When you hit the tab key, the control is also validated, and the cursor leaves the control focus when validation is ok.
Users of the application would like the ENTER and TAB keys to have the same behaviour however; how can I map the ENTER key behaviour to that of the TAB key.

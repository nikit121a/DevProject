Hello.
I have a DevExpress.XtraEditors.XtraUserControl (I try to use an xtraScrollableControl, but I can not make it work), in this control I want to insert other user controls (for example, a graphic) as shown in the attached image; and having the container show a scroll bar when the number of internal controls needs more width than the container and to be able to move the container to show the controls.
Please, it is possible indications to an example of how to achieve functionality like this.
Thank you in advance for your help and support.

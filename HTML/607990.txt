Hello. 
Within my XAF solution, there will be no data shown direct after program start.
When i change the sort-mode, which is set to [oid  last - first] to [oid first -last] all records are shown.
Now i change agait to [oid  last - first] and the use key [Pos1] (may by [Home]) to go to the first entry in the list.
How can I change the behavior to change the data displayed in the sort order and the first record (highest oid) is selected directly after the program start?
Regards
Juergen

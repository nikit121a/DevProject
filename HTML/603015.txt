I want to put a button in a dxLayoutgroup (taken from the HybridApp demo).
The buttons height is 35Pixel, the dxLayoutcontrol that is placed on a cxGroupbox is 60 pixels.
Even with that height, the dxLayoutcontrol shows scrollbars.
In the designer it can be seen that the dxLayoutItem is not much bigger then the button.
The dxLayoutgroup is much higher, it needs some space for the caption.
However, turning off the caption does not free the unused space.
Deleting the text does not help too.
In my case I would need to make the Layoutgroup much bigger than the buttons height to eliminate the scrollbars.
The screenshot shows the visible caption, setting visible to false removes just the text, but does not change the height and positions.
Changing the height manually is not possible.
Is it really a design decision that a Layoutgroup claims that much space ?

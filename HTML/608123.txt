Hi Team,
I am creating a textbox server side with same id and ClientInstanceName ("txtTestStg") and placing in different formlayout.
 Now in textchange event i will pass the formlayout id so i will know which text box i need to read.
Now problem is i am able to get client formlayout clientid but how to readÂ textbox with ID "txtTestStg"  under that formlayout client id.

Hi,
I am using a TreeListControl.
I have an issue where, if the user searches the tree list for a particular string, and after the results are shown, the user refreshes the underlying collection by pressing a refresh button, the tree is empty.
The attached sample shows the behavior. Can you please suggest what is wrong?
Thanks,
Vijay

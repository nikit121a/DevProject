Hi,  
Good morning, I have a query within the subscription that I acquired, I have the possibility of using the Dashboard tool, because although according to the order and what you have told me, I have DevExtreme but when I want to use the controls for the Creation of an App tells me that I have the subscription expired.  
I would like to know please the scope of the subscription that I have.  
Thank you in advance for your support.Â

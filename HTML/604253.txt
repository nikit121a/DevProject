So I have a tile control which loads a frame as its detail page. The detail page in this case contains a page control with one tab sheet and on that tab sheet is a panel aligned alClient. The tab sheet has an OnShow event which sets the caption to be the panel's perimeter as a string. (Demo project attached)
To replicate the issue I'm having, click the tile item to open the detail page (the blue box's caption will be the correct perimeter). Then click the back button. From now on, every time the tile item is clicked, the panel will not have the finalized height and width when the perimeter is calculated in the tab sheet's OnShow event and the perimeter displayed will be wrong. Clicking the panel recalculates the perimeter to show that it will change.
I know that one way to solve this is to post a message in the OnShow event, but this solution isn't great in my real scenario because the code I am triggering in the OnShow event involves visual changes and looks bad when it occurs after the detail page is already visible which happens sometimes if the message takes a relatively long time to be processed.

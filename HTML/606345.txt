Hi,
I set SetThreadDpiAwarenessContext for my app, and everything looks ok but XtraRibbon now acts very unstable:
You need to click multiple times in button to get click event
Also sometimes there is a black box on top of the main form - seems like a bug
I am using 17.2.5 version
I am testing in on 4K UHD Laptop
Any advice?

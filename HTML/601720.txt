Converting approximately 20 solutions from 17.1.3.0 to: 17.2.5.0 is creating by far more work than estimated. All solutions combined contain more than 50 data grids with various data and views. "SettingsCustomizationWindow" is now a major problem. 
Changelog review: 17.1.3.0 to: 17.2.5.0 does not mention anything about that change/ obsolete setting requiring now changes to be made to every single data grid.
Documentation in some topics lists  "SettingsCustomizationWindow" as current and valid some show it as obsolete.
 All documentation sections reference: "SettingsCustomizationWindow" showing: Devexpress.Web.v18.1.dll 
Guess that some documentation update would be helpful. 
In addition, documentation states that the default for: SettingsBehavior.EnableCustomizationWindow is False. When that default settings is in place and the obsolete property of: "SettingsCustomizationWindow Enabled = 'True'", the Customization window will open. This behavior was tested and verified using: 17.2.5.0. In my opinion, an obsolete setting/ property should be ignored but it should never change the default setting of any property assumed to be effective.

In the old scheduler the event for appointment changes included the objects which had changed.
The new scheduler just fires a generic event.
What's the migration guidance here?
Is my only option to attach to the  AppointmentItems.CollectionChanged event?
Also, no 'Image' mapping on the Resource?Â  How do I specify the image?
By the way, the migration doc on the topic of the mappings seems wrong -> CustomFieldMappings should be children of the AppointmentMappings object, but the migration guidance document has both AppointmentMappings and CustomFieldMapping as direct children of the Datasource.AppointmentMappings property.
Thanks!

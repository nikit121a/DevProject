Hi, I need to add a custom button nearby the close button of the DXMessageBox, how can I do? 
I can't use the DXWindow at this time, and I'm unable to find the header items container of the DXMessageBox to add that button. 
I've also try trough the style but without success. Could you please help me? 
Thank you in advance.
Best regards,
Francesco

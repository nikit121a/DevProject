Hi,
I have developed a dashboard view on an asp page.  The web page with the dashboard is working fine in my VS IDE environment.
The dashboard is saved in the folder ~/App_Data/.
When deployed in a IIS the dashboard is missing in the web page.  The error "An error has occurred on an attempt to load the list of available dashboards". 
Where did I went wrong?
Cheers,
Peter

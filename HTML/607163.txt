Using an object datasource that has complex objects within it in the fields list, double clicking the ">" (expand) on an object with the base object causes a complete lock up.  Memory does not increase, but the designer is in some kind of code loop from which it is not released.
Single click to open then close multiple times seems to work, as long as the object property tree has already opened/closed.  Would suggest thread/timing issue.
We do run the designer in a separate thread, in case this may be the trigger for the issue.

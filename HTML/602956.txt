Windows 10
Good Afternoon,
I am running into a very similar issue when using the ReportPrintTool.PrintDialog();
If i call this in Debug mode it works fine.Â  However in Release mode it causes the Application to crash.
The Reports that I am printing contain no Scripting at all.
I see no properties in the report or the printing tool to set the above mentioned values.
I did attempt to modify the App.Config file as stated above to no avail either (Although this could be because it was not nested correctly).
Could you point me to an example showing how to rectify this please.
Also does the latest version of DevEx eliminate this issue?
Thank you,
Buck

Hello,
 I have been looking through the demos, and am trying to find the right control for selecting images or uploading images that mimics the InsertImageDialog from the ASPxHtmlEditor.
In my current project, I have created a page for users to create a webpage with specific parameters, namely a primary heading, a headerimage, and then their own html content via the  ASPxHtmlEditor.
Presently, the header  image is selected via a combobox which is populated from a sql datasource, or uploaded via a separate upload control. This is not nearly as robust as the functionality that comes with the htmleditor, which we have also have connected to a remote Amazon AWS directory for all of our images.
Is there a way to get the same functionality as the  InsertImageDialog to allow users to browse and select an image or upload their own?

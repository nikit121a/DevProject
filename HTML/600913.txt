We have a business object (EmploymentRecord) that can be linked to one or more objects representing skills (Skill) in a many to many relationship.  The Link / Unlink actions provided by the LinkUnlinkController are available from the EmploymentRecord_Skills_ListView and the Skill_EmploymentRecords_ListView. 
In our object model each EmploymentRecord belongs to exactly one Employee record (aggregated relationship). An employee (Employee) can have one or more Employment Records, of which only one can be active at any time. The active employment record is made available via the Employee.CurrentEmploymentRecord property.  We'd like to make it easy for the user to view / manage the skills linked to the employee's active employment record. We'd like to add an action to the Employee view controller to pop-up a dialog that lists all the skills associated with the employee's active employment record. The List Skills action we coded in the attached sample program partially works. It lists the associated skills but is missing the Link and Unlink actions that would allow the user to adjust the list of skills linked to the active employment record.  What must we do to enable these actions?

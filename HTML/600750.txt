Hello,
we use the ThemedWindow  with RibbonControl like this:
Now we log into a RDP-session (high resolution, high DPI) and start the program. After that we switch the device (other resolution, low/normal DPI) and log into this RDP-session. Windows starts the resize process and after some time the following error occurs:
Above mentioned error occurs between one and three times before the last error is thrown (Sometimes this error only occurs if you close the window):
I've attached a sample-project to reproduce this error. The error occurs in DXWindow and DXRibbonWindow too.
Best regards 
Sylvio

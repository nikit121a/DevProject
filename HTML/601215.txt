In the latest build the code in the cxLookAndFeels.pas file was modified as follows
  cxDefaultIsTouchScrollUIModeEnabled = {$IFDEF USETOUCHSCROLLUIMODEASDEFAULT}True{$ELSE}False{$ENDIF};
  ...
  cxDefaultLookAndFeelNativeStyle = {$IFDEF USENATIVELOOKANDFEELASDEFAULT}True{$ELSE}False{$ENDIF};
I tried setting and/or resetting the compiler directive(s) at project level, but it did not do anything. 
 {$Define USETOUCHSCROLLUIMODEASDEFAULT} 
or
{$UnDef USETOUCHSCROLLUIMODEASDEFAULT}
What is the recommended procedure for setting  the default mode for non touch clients?  Set or unset one or both and  where exactly?
Thanks

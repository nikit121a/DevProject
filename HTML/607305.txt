These do not help me.. 
I have a main report - Daily note
On it, I have several subreports that need to populate if there is data in the subreports
1. Order Subreport
2. Results Subreport
3. addendum subreport
If the detail of the subreport is empty, then I do not want to have it Print ANYTHING.  No labels etc that are on the report.  I also want the space the subreport occupies to shrink and disappear.  All fields below the box on the main report to slide up.  
I see many articles but no solutions on how to do this..
Please help.
 The attachment shows: 
Results: BIG SPACE   
Order: BIG SPACE
Addendum Note: BIG SPACE.
None of these and the space should not be there..

Hi,
I've attached sample solution to show You my problem.
I have  2 the same GridControls with filtered columns - 1st grid have column filter to "Column = Unchecked", 2nd grid have column filter to "Column = Checked". Both of grid are bounded to the same collection from the same object.
I have in both simple InitNewRow procedure that on 1st grid sets column to Unchecked and on the 2nd grid sets column to Checked .
When I want to add record on 1st grid it appers on the 2nd one too - it's not filtered by the GridView conditions.
Try add new record to one of grid inÂ  Sample Solution, which I've attached.
Maybe there is other way to do this binding to make it working correct?

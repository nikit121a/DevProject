I have a popup window which shows a list view.  I have the SelectionDependencyType = SelectionDependencyType.RequireSingleObject and the    SelectionContext set the the list view shown in the popup window.  I need to have the Accept action (OK action) to be active only when the object in the list view meets criteria.  I have set the target object criteria of the action, but it does not appear to have any impact.  What am i doing wring?

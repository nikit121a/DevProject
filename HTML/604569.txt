Dear support,
I am sending emails without problems from report in PDF format. My question is, where are the email sent?
I have looked for in sent items folder and it is missing. 
I use the example routine and in FROM and TO fields I use my email address. I receive the email, but I not found the email sended.
I use Outlook with Office 365 mail.
King regards. 
Eduardo.

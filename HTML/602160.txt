Hello,
I downloaded yesterday the 30day trial.
I wanted to make  a prove of concept for an easy (sales) dashboard  to compare it with  some visualisation components of a other software company.
Our  external developer advised to use telerik, but since I had some nice experience with Devexpres in the past i wanted to test this software  first.
(I will have the final choose)
When I launch the Sales  Dashboard from the DevExtreme Demo its works, but when I open the  solution in visual studio en run it, the data will not load. Al the  screens say Loading.... (you can fiend a screenshot attached)
Is there something I can check or do to solve this problem?
I'm very new to this part and have no idea where to start looking.
Hopefully you can provide me some help to this problem.
Best regards,
Tom

Hello,
   I have an Excel data source. I would like to display it. However, Excel is not significat, it's only example. So, I can display it using SpreadSheetControl. It's fine, but too complicated to process the data programatically, it is either user unfriendly or even impossible.
   My goal is to sort both rows and columns by some criteria. Maybe I can sort rows by specified column data, but columns sorting seems to be impossible or very unfriendly using SpreadSheetControl.
    So, I am thinking about my own data model. I will load data to my data model, e.g. then I can transform the data by specified criteria and later save modified data back to the data source or do any other operation. The data are in matrix form 
.
   The problem is, how to display it in GUI?  There is unknown count of columns or rows. So, I think clasiccal GridView is impossible to use it (cannot define columns in design time etc.).
   Please, help. Thank you very much in advance.
   Best Regards,
     Radim 
PS: One of the goals is to sort the data in both dimensions and  then set custom background color to selected cells.

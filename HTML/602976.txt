Hi,
I'm using 2 developments machine.
First one is under Window 7 x64, second one is under Windows 10 x64.
With the second one, this line is missing in the designer when I'm using tilenavpane 
 When it's missing, text and image in every navbutton is uncorrectly drawn.
Don't know if it can help you , but it occurs every time under windows 10 machine.
Regards

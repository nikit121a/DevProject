If a field bounded to an enums data type is moved from filter to data area by code (even when load a layout from memory stream) an exception was throw.
If you drag the field manually from filter to data area all works fine.
The problem is that users move the field to data arrea, save layout and than, when reload the layout, the exception was throw.
The problem is not present in the 16.2.5 version.
I attach the sample project, just clic on Button1.
Thanks

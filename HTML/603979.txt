Hi,
I see that there has been change in behavior from 17.1.7 to 17.2.3
In 17.1 I can set  TreelistColumn.Width to zero while in 17.2.3 it does not make any affect.
The issue is that in 17.1 the TreeListColumn.Width 
set is 
 in 17.2.3 set is
 
Please advise how can I achieve setting Column's width to zero that makes the desired effect.
Thank you

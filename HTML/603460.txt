After upgrading from 16.2.6 to 17.2.4 I get this EClassNotFound error in TcxCustomGridView.RestoreFromRegistry.
I initially thought this had to with settings stored under 16.2.6 and restored under 17.2.4, but after executing TcxCustomGridView.StoreToRegistry under 17.2.4, the problem persists.
FWIW, the data being stored:
  AStorageName '\Software\TimeTell\ontwikkel\Forms\TDialoogEditAgenda_123\GridDienstRoostersDBTableView'
  ARecreate True
  Options [gsoUseSummary]
  ASaveViewName ''
  AOwnerName ''
and the attached screenshot shows the contents of that registry key  
The funny thing is, if I e.g. switch two columns or change sort order I see that these get restored nicely.
What can be going on or is there anything I can try?
We do not use conditional formatting.
This is in a complex app, so I have not made a sample project yet.
Another TcxGridConditionalFormattingProvider issue was reported here: 
but seems unrelated and has been fixed in 17.2.4

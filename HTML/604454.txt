Hello,
I've created a UserControl containing a LookUpEdit with a TreeView inside the popup, but I'm having the following problems:
- the LookUpEdit's EditValue fires on mouse over instead of on click
- the selection should be valid only for the bottom level items (Children list empty)
- the LookUpEdit's DisplayMember doesn't show the value for the selected item
I attached a sample to demonstate the issues.
Thanks,
Fabio

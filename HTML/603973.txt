Dear support,
On the main form that the scheduler control is located, I'm using the events "AppointmentsInserted", "AppointmentsChanged" and "AppointmentsDeleted" to execute the needed CRUD operations on the corresponding business objects. The problem I'm facing is that I cannot fetch the "ReminderInfo" data to store them in the DB. There is no "ReminderInfo" property under the "Appointment" class to get the needed data. I want them as string and not as XML. Basically, I need something similar like the implementation you have for the "RecurrenceInfo" property.
Best regards,
Andreas

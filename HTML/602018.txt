We have either light or dark themes defined against our individual Dashboard Templates. I have now modified our web viewer to use ASPxDashboard, with callbacks and as a result no longer have to refresh the page when changing dashboard.
Unfortunately every attempt i've made to alter the theme is not working, is there any way of doing this programatically?

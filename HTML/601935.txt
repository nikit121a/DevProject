in my js code, I called 3 times 'PerformCallback' like this
dtgTurnAround.PerformCallback(parameters);
the 3 times' parameters value is  always like this:
1st time: empty
2nd time: owner|123
3nd time:plant|567
so I want to get the result which is from the 3rd  PerformCallback, but when I debug the code, I found the callback code method 'dtgTurnAround_CustomCallback', the order is not same as what I wanted, maybe parameter 'owner|123' is the 3rd executed, so the result is wrong,
Is there any method to make the the executed order same as js order?

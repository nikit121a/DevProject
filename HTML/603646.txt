Hi,
We are using DevExpress GridControl for one of our Application.
On the control the application user applies filter & grouping.
The data binded to the control undergoes background Updates which is very well shown to the user.
We are seeing following issues with the Updates
1. With Filter : -
Suppose there is a Column Name "IsAuthorized" which can have values "Y" or "N". 
User has applied the filter to see only the rows where "IsAuthorized" = "Y".
Suppose with background Data Updates one of the row changes its IsAuthorized from "Y" to "N"
The issue is User still sees the Updated Record with "IsAuthorized" = "N",  Instead of the row getting filtered out
2. With Grouping
In the above example, instead of filtering, Suppose User has grouped the Data on Column "IsAuthorized"
There are two groups now. One with "IsAuthorized" = "Y".& other as "IsAuthorized" = "N".
Suppose with background data updates one of the row changes from "IsAuthorized" = "Y" to "IsAuthorized" = "N".
We see the updated value but the issue is the record still shows in the group with  "IsAuthorized" = "Y" instead of moving to group with  "IsAuthorized" = "N".
Kindly help..
Best Regards

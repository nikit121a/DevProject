Hi,
I am using your MVC Dashboard, and in the dashboard I have a Grid and a Bubble Map Item.  I enabled Cross-Data-Source-Filtering in the Grid, so when I click a row in the grid, the Bubbles on the map gets updated.
However, if the map is zoomed to England for example, and then I click a row in the grid, for which the coordinates are in Denmark, then the map is not set and zoomed automatically to Denmark, and the end-user would have to manually zoom out and zoom in to Denmark in order to see the bubbles in Denmark map.
Is there any way to make this automatic? 
Best regards,
Fadi

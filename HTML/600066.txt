Our inherited XRSubReport is not working since the Update 17.2.5. With Update 17.2.4 it works fine.
We set the e.Cancel property in the OnBeforePrint event to true. After MyBase.OnBeforePrint the property is  reseted to false.
It seems to appear only on PageFooterBands.
I attached the example project.

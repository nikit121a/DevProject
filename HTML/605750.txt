Hello,
I am working with EntityFeedbackSource for the first time and have a couple of questions.
 2. With a regular System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource, there is a CurrentChanged event, which fires when the user selects a row in the grid (when the grid is bound to a regular BindingSource).  What is the corresponding technique for EntityFeedbackSource to tell when the user has selected a new row in the grid?  
Thanks!

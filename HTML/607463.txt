Hi, I'm having a problem with new forms that are opened through the KeyDown event of a searchControl fixed in the ribbon status bar.
To explain what happens, run the attached project and check the following:
 
1- Create 2x a new form via the Ribbon Open Form button
2- Click on any area of the RibbonPageGroup2 and see that the last form is still active
3- Now, focus the searchEdit on the form's statusbar and press enter
4- Click on any area of RibbonPageGroup2 and see that the penultimate form is activated, but the focus should remain on the last created tab (form).
I noticed that this only occurs when the form is created via the searchControl's keyDown event.
I'm doing something wrong, how do I solve this?
Thank you very much for your help.

Hello!
We implemented the Spellchecker in our project.
So far everything works fine but we have the situation that we use some extended Layouts. We use the Layoutcontrol with some EditControls on it and built a TabbedLayoutControlGroup with UserControls. So you have direct Editcontrols mixed with tabs.
SpellChecker.CheckContainer works fine but only for these controls which are visible. That means also onyl for the selected tab in the TabbedLayoutControlGroup.
Is it possible to extend the SpellChecker that with the method CheckContainer I can also check all the tabs with one click?
Thanks
Peter

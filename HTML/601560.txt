Hello,
I'm trying to have my apps behave correctly in High DPI (or rather in scaled mode) and have their size/position saved/restored when closed/opened.
 I am attaching a simple project that shows the problem : click on the open button, position and size the window, close it and re-click on "open" : position and size will change (grow) on scaled monitors. It works correctly on unscaled monitors.
And if you change TForm2's ancestor from TdxRibbonForm back to TForm, sizes and positions are working as expected.
What am I doing wrong ?
Thanks,

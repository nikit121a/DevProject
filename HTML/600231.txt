Hi,
I have a TabbedForm which works really well and allows me to have multiple records open at any one time, however i would like to use a navbar in order to open up new tabs. I understand that this inherits from XtraForm and therefore can't be used on a user control which I could embed on a regular form.
I can get the nav bar on there, but the tabbed form just goes behind it. Even clicking send to back on the nav bar still causes this issue.
Is there any solution to allow me to use a TabbedForm with a NavBar or is there a better control to use?

This is a continuation from the ticket about displaying thousands of records. I have not implemented this grid yet. However, I think my process may be a little different than the demo and need assistance with it. I have a payroll report which utilizes a stored procedure to obtain it's data. It is then put through some functions to separate and combine entries that need separated or combined. Then, all that data is put into a list. The grid view will utilize that list to populate the columns. This is causing a big issue in performance. I wasn't sure if there was something that I could do utilizing the DevExpress GridView and LINQServerMode or not? I can't really upload the project though.Â

Hello Team,
I am using card layout in flow mode to display information and I am trying to set the ItemsPerPage property dynamically based on GetDocumentClientWidth(), so that the view is in accordance with the page width. 
But the ItemsPerPage property is not being updated on PerformCallback and the initial settings are retained.  Please suggest a way to make the card view, update the ItemsPerPage property dynamically. Find the relevant sample code snippets below:
The view always shows 3 cards (initial setting), even though the ViewBag.ColCount is being changed.

==============Index.cshtml==============

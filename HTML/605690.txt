Tested in on a company machine and on my private machine,
i seem to can't get the Demo working you have provided for DevExtreme with .NetCore support.
The Page starts, but the Frame where the Grid should appear stays empty.
I've checked the source and Javascript Console and couldn't find any obvious reasons.
Any pointers where the problem might lay?
Other Demos ,not using .NetCore seem to work properly.

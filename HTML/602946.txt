Hello
I am trying to use  DisplayImageChecked andÂ DisplayImageUnchecked but the images are not displaying.
Without those settings the standard check box was being displayed (refer attachment). The image url's were created by navigating from the properties.
With or without an image the filtering on the column works correctly.
How can I get the images to display?

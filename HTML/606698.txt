Good morning,
I'm having some issues displaying iOS icon in mobile devices.
I'm using Cordova  v. 4.5.4 and Phonegap cli-8.0.0, update the template and the solution and the version of DevExtreme using your hotfix,  as your instruction in this ticket 
, but I'm still not seeing the application icon on iOS (11.2).
Do you have any suggestion? The problem is not completely resolved?
Thank you,
Stefano

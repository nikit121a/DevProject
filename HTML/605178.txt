Hi
In a View using the GridControl I want to show in the FixedTotalSummary
1) The Total row count. That is the full count of the ItemsSource BEFORE any column filters and search criteria are applied
2) The 'filtered' row count, i.e. what is shown on screen AFTER any column filters and search criteria are applied
I can get (2) to happen using the following XAML
but I don't know how to get (1).   
Ideally, what I would like to show is ONE message in the FixedTotalSummary so that
when there are NO filtered rows : Message = "Row Count = XXX"  
when there are >0 filtered rows : Message = "Row Count = YYY of XXX"
Is any of this possible?
Thanks for any help.

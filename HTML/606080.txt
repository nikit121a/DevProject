I am wondering if there is a way to set each Point's legend text individually  inside a Pie chart. I need this to accomplish the following scenario:
I have a pie chart which displays wedges based on the number of records which have values within a given range. 
I would like to display legend text for each wedge in the chart based on its range like so: "<Argument> <RangeMin>-<RangeMax> <Percentage of Total>"
Here are some of the issues I've run into and what I've tried:
1.) 
When I attempt to format the legend text as written above, the legend will display the average of the minimum and maximum value instead of the Min + "-" + Max. This occurs even if I explicitly set the LegendTextPattern to display a static value. You can see an example of this in the first attached image.
2.) 
When attempting to set the legend text for each point individually, it seems to set the legend text for the whole series.  I have tried to do this using the Series.LegendTextPattern as there does not seem to be a property which I can set each Wedge's legend text. In addition, I have also tried overriding the CustomDrawSeriesPoint method and setting the CustomDrawSeriesPointEventArgs.LegendText as well and noticed the same result. To illustrate this point, I have overridden the CustomDrawSeriesPoint method to set the  CustomDrawSeriesPointEventArgs.LegendText to a random integer for each point, however each legend item would display only the last Point's integer in the legend.
Any help you can give would be appreciated.

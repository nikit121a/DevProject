Hi Paulo,
Ive been looking through tickets with regard to the PDFViewer function "SavePagesAsImagesToDisk"
so that users can save their PDFs as images for use elsewhere in my application, which is mainly to 
load images into TcxImageCollection for viewing with the TdxImageSlider controls. 
Now, it is my understanding that this ONLY works with EMF's and BMP's, which "sometimes"
work reasonably, but in the main don't convert PDFs into the image formats provided correctly.
I have attached the failed PDF supplied by a customer that was loaded into PDFViewer, the method used
 and the resulting EMF it created, which you can try.
Can you suggest a method to create either JPG or PNG images from the "SavePagesAsImagesToDisk"
which 'may' help, or do you have any idea why these images are not being created correctly?
I suspect its something to do with vectors in the PDF graphics, but it would be good if it converted PDFs 
properly as it promises...
Thanks in advance for your help:)

p.s Ive also seen mention of the ComponentPrinter "PaintPage" function, but have no clue how this can save the image :)! 
Any examples would be really appreciated !

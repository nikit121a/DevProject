hi. I have been facing a problem for a while, in certain scenarios when the user save an object, for instance, I do some validations and if it's the case I need to display some information to the user and ask if he wants to continue and save the object or if he wants to cancel the save process in order to correct the issue in the detail view and press the save button again. I am working with XAF Web and with EF, I do implement the interface that provide me acces to the OnSaving method that allow me to cancel the saving proccess by throwing an exception but don?t know how to accomplish the desired behaviour. Basically when the user press Save, Save and new o Save and close, i need to display a popup with a custom text if some condition is rigth, that allow him to continue or cancel the save process. I will be pleace if you point me in the correct direction or even more if you have some demo example, from my point of view it?s a commun scenario but I have been unable to located the proper documentation or example.
Thank you very much

We have a requirement for a custom button to appear along with the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons in a MessageBox.   This button will display special text.
What I've done.
1. Created a Form
2. Added 3 Buttons (OK, Custom Button, Cancel)
3. Added a TPanel
4. Put a TLabel on the TPanel.
The problem I'm having is that the borderlines are appearing around the TLabel (or TPanel) control unlike the Standard Windows MessageBox that do not show borderlines.
What properties need to be set?

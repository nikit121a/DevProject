Hello, 
On a XAF View we have a functionality for the user to save, retrieve and apply custom filters to and from a database.Â 
Now I want to transfer this functionality to a web application (Anagular 5, to be precise). 
I've seen some inconsistencies between the filter string of the XAF data grid and the Devextreme one. 
Specifically, the currently saved filters have the following format: 
[ColumnName!] = ##XpoObject#Name.Space.To.Entity(ID)# And [ColumnName!] = ##XpoObject#Name.Space.To.Entity(1)# 
Which comes directly from the GridView.ActiveFilterString property. 
On the web app however, calling dataGrid.instance.getCombinedFIlter(true)  returns an json-like format:
ColumnName,contains,Value,and,ColumnName,contains,Value
Is there a way  of conversion between these two formats or do I have to do it manually?
Thanks in advance.

Hello,
I have a PivotGrid with a column that has a LookUpEdit.
The ValueMember is a integer and the DisplayMember is a string.
When I print the PivotGrid (ShowRibbonPrintPreview()), the column shows the DisplayMember, but when I use the control in the RibbonPrintPreview to export to Excel ( .xls  OR .xlsx ), the colum shows the ValueMember.
I want the Excel to show the DisplayMember. How can I achieve this?
The project sample is attached in this ticket.
I also created a video to reproduce the error.
Thank you

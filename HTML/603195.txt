hi 
i have attached a sample with a grid t hat has the column resource with a lookup datasource.
inspecting the sample in the network tab i find that the request for the resource column takes quite a long time...
maybe in this scenario not really, but the thing is, when i call  seasonResourceDataStoreForGrid.load() by hand (console), it has such a significantly different content download...

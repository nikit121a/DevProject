I am reaching here, but do you have anything like a notification bubble option in one of your controls?  What I really want is a little bubble that I can show above a menu item with it's own separate menu like pull down to show the user quick information about the notification.
I was hoping to hack it in with jquery, but bugs in IE are making that very difficult.  I have looked through your controls and do not see anything like this, but thought it was worth asking.
Attached you will see a mock-up of what it might look like, with a green notification bubble showing the number of notifications a user has for a given menu item.

Hi,
I'm currently trying to implement the AdornerUI Guide Element into my application as an introduction-tutorial for new features.
A big part of my application is done with an TileNavPane and therefore I would like to explain each TileNavButton / TileNavCategory seperately.
Unfortunately I can only set the NavPane TargetElement for the Guide, not the individual TileNavButtons, so the Highlighted area contains everything in the NavPane.
Is it possible to resize the Highlighted Area (with margin, padding, offset or something) to get only single elements of the TileNavPane highlighted?
I attached a sample project to mess around with. In the example, I just want the "Category1"-Named Button highlighted.

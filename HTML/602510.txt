When a BottstrapGridView's SettingsBeahviour has "ConfirmDelete = true", the grid users a javascript CONFIRM prompt to prompt the user if they're sure about deleting the record.
I would like to replace the default javascript  CONFIRM to use a nicer Bootstrap modal prompt instead.
Please can you tell me how to accomplish this?

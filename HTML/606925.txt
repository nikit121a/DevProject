Hello DevExpress,
For some reason, I am unable to get the adaptivity work for the below grid... the columns do not shrink or hide...
Is this because I am setting column widths? If so, is there a way to set some proportions between columns... for instance, have the name double size of phone number....etc?
Thank you!
Sherif

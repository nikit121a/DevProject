Hi
I have large GridView with many columns so that it is bigger than the windows size.  My problem with this is that when I scroll to the very right and edit a cell (Scrolling1.png), after hitting the save button it sets the scrollbar position to the very left and very top (Scrolling2.png).
I want that the scrollbar is kept on the same position so that I can continue to work on other columns without scrolling back every time
Regards
Patrick

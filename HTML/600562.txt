Hi!
I've customized the Total pivotgrid section using FieldValueDisplayText event and PivotDrillDownDataSource object.
Data is "correctly" shown , but as you can see in the attachment file,Â I'd like to create the cells corresponding to columns FLD4, FLD5,FLD6,FLD7 and FLD8 to improve readability (see worksheet "Desired").
Is it possible?
 Thanks in advance!

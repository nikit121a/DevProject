Hello,
we are developping  an Energy Trading System with XPO as ORM Mapper.
We have customers withÂ about 350000  trades per year. 90% of the trades are assigned to one customer.
When loading one customer with many trades assigned XPO seems to load the whole trade collection which lasts very long even if the data is not beeing accessed.
Is there a way to implement lazy loading so that the collection of the trade will be filled when it is being acessed?.
Thanks
Michael

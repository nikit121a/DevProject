Hi,
I'm using the scheduler with AngularJS and I have a bug in Mozilla Firefox. You can reproduce the bug in your demo on the link :  
Steps:
1- Choose "Timeline Work Week" view
2- Scroll vertica lly on the middle
3- Click on the scheduler (an empty cell)
4- Scroll on the left, on the right, on the left, and you can use the time scale header is stuck, the scroll works fine but not the time scale header
Thanks !

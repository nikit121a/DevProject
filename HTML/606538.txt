Hi,
I have installed vs2017 and devexpress 17.1.6 since September 2017Â 
I was working normally, with some exceptions when the above message obliged me to redesign my projects.
Since a month I installed 17.2.4 having both devexpress versions, but I worked with the old version.
Since 3 days it is impossible for me to build any project, even these projects that I have already finished, build and deployed, with the message as below.
I remove the file licence.licx but the message is still there.
I am attaching a very simple project (a test one) which is already deployed, on my sharepoint server.
Can you please advice ?
Do I have to downgrade to vs2015 ?

Hi support,
I Need to select all rows of a group row that is child of other grouprow, i already test your example (E1760 - aspxgridview-how-to-implement-select-unselect-for-all-rows-in-a-group-row ) but this only works if grouprow do not have other group row, that means, only works if it is group by one level.
Can you help me please.
Regards,
Bruno Sequeira

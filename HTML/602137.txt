Hi Team,
Could you please help me understand, what's the actual difference between CustomSummary and CustomCellValue events?
I understand that  CustomCellValue is executed for every cell and it goes after the summary calculation.
What is the proper usage of those?
If I want to calculate custom summary I can actually do it in CustomCellValue event handler, then what's the profit of having CustomSummary? 
Thanks in advance!

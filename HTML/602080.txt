Hello
I have a devexpress gridview and i have several bool fields in the datasource.
Now i want to display icons instead of the checkbox.
If the bool is true i want a green tick (apply icon) and if the boolean is false i want to display the red cross in the cell.
Can i achieve this approach using the gridview's format rules?
If not, how to?
Thank you!
Best regards!
John

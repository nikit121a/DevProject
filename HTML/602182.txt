I use SaveLayoutToXml and RestoreLayoutFromXml from TabbedView.
It works fine, but how can I reset the TabbedView if it fails? If the user modifies the xml-file...
If RestoreLayoutFromXml throws an exception I can?t add documents anymore. (The return value of TabbedView.AddDocument is null) 
How can I reset the TabbedView to avoid this?
TabbedView.Controller.ResetLayout is not the solution.
I modified a sample project and made a video.

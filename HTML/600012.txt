I am using the aspxhtmleditor inside an aspxgridview to edit items as shown here:
Everything works fine when running the "localhost", but when I upload to the web hosting server, it shows this error when trying to upload an image.
Request for ConfigurationPermission failed while attempting to access confiiguration section 'system.web/httpRuntime'.Â  To allow all callers to access the data for this section, set section attribute 'requirePermission' equal 'false' in the configuration file where this section is declared.
I checked the directory permissions, and modify permission is enabled for files on the server.
I cannot seem to fine the exact attribute specified in the error.
Can you help me figure out how to fix this?

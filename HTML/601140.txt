Hello,
my question is, if you see an alternative to  TcxDBGridColumn - OnGetProperties event?
Our problem is, that in our application data to TcxBridDBTableView are loaded, the number of lines is not fix, varying between 10 and max. 500.
We have 4 columns, ID, text, datatype and the fourth column  is the one, which can be edited by the user. And here we use OnGetProperties to set the editor depending on datatype-column. So, the datatype can be different from record to record... And, what I should mention, a special datatype requires a SQL-statement, asking the database to fill a drop-down list, so in this case we can not use a defined TcxRepositoryItem, but we create one at run time.
With this implementation, the loading of data into the TcxBridDBTableView is (depending on the number of records) somestimes very slow.
Do you have an idea how to change the implementation, probably we could use a different component to solve this issue?
Thank you in advance,
best regards,
Christoph

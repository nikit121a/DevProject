I have the same problem after upgrading to 17.2.5, but only when an item has been added to the tagBox by another control.
We are using an Autocomplete to search for people then adding it to the tagbox, this was working in in version 16 I believe.
I have recreated the problem on codepen:Â 
Click on the star button to add the person to the tagbox, then attempt to remove them.
It's fine if you set the datasource to the Email object.

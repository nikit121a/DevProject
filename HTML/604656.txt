I have successfully built a group of pivot grids that utilize the settings.PreRender event to add field.FilterValues that are used to filter out everything I dont want appearing on the Pivot Grid itself. These setting work perfectly with a standalone PivotGrid. But once I was forced to use your PivotCustomizationExtension the filtering is not being applied anymore and when using the PivotGrid it just hangs on loading when I drag a filter into the column area or row area. Here is the code for the PivotGridSettings that are used for both the PivotGrid and PivotCustomizationExtension :
 
Everrything loads properly onto the pivot grid and the preset filters and Measures appear in the correct locations on the PivotCustomizationExtension but once anything is dragged to one of the other parts the entire grids is stuck on loading. Plus the numbers that are initially shown on the PivotGrid are incorrect they are showing all data rather than the filtered data. All of these settings work fine for the standalone PivotGrid it is only once I implemented the PivotCustomizationExtension that this error occurred.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

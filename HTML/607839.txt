I have a ASPxSpinEdit control on a page which gets set to client.Enabled = false on the server.
it seems when someone attempts to select the text and delete it, it causes the browser to go back 1 page in history if using IE. While i'm not too worried about it because most people here use chrome (it's recommended), I do believe this may be undesirable behavior for your controls. I have not checked against edge, firefox, safari or opera.  On Chrome it works as expected, meaning nothing happens. The only time the backspace key should cause someone to go back in history is if the page is clicked (the page itself has the focus and not a control inside the page).

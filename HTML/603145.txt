Hi,
I have a chart which has a datasource specified by an array.
On a button click (without a server trip) I'd like to apply a filter to the chart based on a column on the datasource.Â  Is this possible?
If it's not possible with an array, then could you please explain how it would be best implemented given that I'm using ASP.NET Core MVC as my backend?
Thanks

Hello we have the following issue:
We are trying to manage the enability of various button on the ribbon of the spreadsheet, particularly the copy, cut and paste buttons.
To do so we binded the IsEnabled property to our own value but it seems like our binding is not taken into consideration and is overriden inside the frameworks.
Is it possible to manage the enability of the different ribbon item ?
If so what did we missed in our binding to manage it properly ?
Here is an example of our bindings:
<dxb:UpdateAction ElementName="{x:Static dxsps:DefaultBarItemNames.RibbonItem_Home_Clipboard_Cut}" PropertyName="IsEnabled" Value="{Binding IsCopyPasteEnabled, Mode=TwoWay}" />

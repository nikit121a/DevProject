This is a small example of what we are trying to do.  The call to get the json in our real application returns the json as a stream and there will be a lag between actual full objects returned. In the sample it would be as if the first person object arrived in 2 seconds, the second person object is returned 10 seconds later, etc.  Also there may be 1000s of large objects streaming as a chunked post response. 
I need the ui to update as each item comes in.  I need each row to populate immediately, not after all are returned.
If you place a break point in MainWindow.xaml.cs line 23, you will see that I "ADD" the item to the ObservableCollection but if you step over the add, the row does not appear in the table.  The rows only show after all results are received.
Thank you for you help on this issue.

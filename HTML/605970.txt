Hello DevExpress team !
I'm trying to display custom objects in a Listbox. This object is a line with values about a measurement point (time, temperature, strenght..).
But, I can have 10 000 measurement points in the same file, and so, 10 000 lines.
If I try to load 10 000 line into the Listbox, my application is frozen for a while.
Do you have quick solution to :
-To load the objects in background application and do not freeze the HMI
or
-To load only the X first objects (the ones the operator can see on the screen), and load other measurement when the operator will scroll into the listbox  
Thank you in advance.
I wish you a good day !
Kind regards,
M.Lozach

Dear Support!
We have an "overcomplicated" navigation bar (TdxNavBar).
We use more subgroups in it.
We have "A" and "B" link in Navbar, and "A"/"B" functions in the background.
"A" makes a dialog, and it have button can call "B". In "B" dialog we have button that call "A".
In the buttons I search for the another NavBar link, and I select it.
Yesterday my boss moved these two links (A, B) into separated subgroups. Now they are far in position.
After this I the "Select" function don't make the another link visible.
The link is selected, but the view not scrolled to needed area.
So I'm in dialog "A", and I push the button "B". 
After the form close I navigate to "B" link, I selected it. 
The function started, but the "B" link don't visible in the upper area, the scrollbar remains on original position.
I found "MakeLinkVisible" function in Navbar, but it have strange effects or it have not effects. :-(
We have more other problems with this NavBar, and I suspect these subgroups cause them.
(Expands/collapses makes wrong scrollbar, the control is not well formatted)
 Subgroup:
I have created a demo application.
I dynamically create a dxNavBar with groups, and subgroups.
The subgroup items everytime created  in 14. item (0 based).
When you search without subgroups, for example, 5. group / 12. element - the selection is ok, and you can see this item (MakeVisible is working well).
Next you search with subgroup, for example: 3. group, 14. element (you need to use it as constant), and 5. subelement.
The group changes. The selected element is ok. But it is not visible. The control remains in previous state.
You can scroll down with scrollbar, and you can see the element, it is selected, but the MakeLinkVisible isn't working.
I hope you can also see this problem in the demo.
Thank your for any help!

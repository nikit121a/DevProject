Since I upgraded DevExpress from v16.1 to 17.2.4, now 17.2.5, I am getting more and more often the "Cannot create a document for the current report" (without internal server error) error. I don't get any compile error or any error while debugging! This happens especially after "re-"debugging the project and refreshing the page. There are two cases where this error comes:
1. when I click the submit button to create the report
2. the user can save reports with specific selection of parameters (so the user doesn't have to re-enter the filter values), and when navigating to the page where those reports are listed the error comes up.
The error doesn't come always! And when not refreshing the previous page but working on the new browser tab or browser window, the error comes more rarely!
Is there any workaround, any solution or documentation about this issue?
I can't give you currently more information because I can't find what is causing this problem and which scenarios exactly, it just comes sometimes and sometimes not!!!

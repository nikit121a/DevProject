Hello the present question is linked to the previous one we had regarding the enability of Copy/Paste in the RibbonItem.
It appears the IsEnabled property of the different RibbonItems  is not linked to the IsEnabled property of their PopupMenuItem counterpart.
In our case the copy and paste buttons are still available through the PopUp menu of the  spreadsheet.
Is it the standard behavior  for the frameworks to separate the states of the Ribbon and PopUp buttons even if they are linked to the same action ?

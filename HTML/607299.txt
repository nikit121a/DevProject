Hi all,
I'm using LayoutGoroup and LayoutPanel in one view.
I set a Caption for each panel but I don't found how to reduce size of it.
After reading other tickets in your support center, there is a lot of sample to set the color, the fontfamily but how to change its height ?
I attached a picture with huge empty space at the top and the bottom.
And see below how I use it
My goal is to get more place for the content.
Thanks in advance for your help.

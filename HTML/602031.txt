After I upgraded DevExpress Winforms to version 17.2.5. The "Add DevExpress Item" menu item is grayed out within the solution explorer. I can add items for an older version. However, that is not what I want.Â 
I ran a DevExpress WinForms installer repair
I restarted my Windows PC
I upgraded Visual Studio Community
Please help me out!

Thank you!
And as a quick follow up:
Is there a way I can entirely replace the string that appears as the caption for that cell? The URLs are longer than the cell is wide, so I would like to replace what is displayed with custom text.
Currently the best I can do is prepend/append to the field by using 
    properties.TextFormatString = "foo {0}";
Whereas
properties.TextFormatString = "User's profile";
does not work.

Guys,
I have serious problem that costed me several days of working for nothing. I lost all my nerves until we find out what is problem, and I don't know what caused it.
On my machine default font is 7.8, and on the computers of my colleagues is 8.25 - for example.
The biggest problem is that one is shown in designer, and another in application. 
You can see attached pictures...
It is very important for me to have everything in correct size, and it is very difficult to do that when designer and app show different things.
HowÂ  can I fix this?
Thank you,
Hristina

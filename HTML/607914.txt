Hello,
I using WPF MVVM Pattern.
I Have one View in that I use the Navigation frame and in Navigation frame 
I place One Button and one Gridview. When click on Button I am getting null value of obj in Method
But when I place Button outside of Navigation Frame that  time my button command
works properly means I am not get the null object of Grid table view which is passed in Button Command parameter .
Please help me as soon as possible.

Hi,
We have a excel filter dropdown checklist with customized items added.
If open the dropdown list, check a few items (A, B, C) and close it. Next time when open the drop down list, I am wondering if
there is a way to get those items (A, B, C) remain selected.
I am following the following post:
, but it does not provide a way to check any of the customized items added.
Thanks!
Fang

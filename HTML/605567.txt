Hi
I would like to use the autofilter row  for the resource tree.
So, I used the following  code:
 
But, as you can see on the attached screenshot, I only have the options "Equal" and "Not Equal".
If I try to set the filter through the FilterEditor, I also find no "Contains".
Are there any limitations to this "contains"-option? 
btw:
The property "GanzerName"  is of type string.

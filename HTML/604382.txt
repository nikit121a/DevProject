Hello,
I use the DevExpress.ui.notify function  to display multiple notification at the same time (playing with the position option in order stack the notifications)
I also set the closeOnOutsideClick to allow users to close the notifications but when two or more toasts are displayed the click close only the last opened toast.
Is it the intended behaviour ? If yes how select all the opened toast (in order to close all of them on the hiding event)?

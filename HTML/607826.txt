If you create a LabelControl with:
 AutoSizeModel Vertical,
MaximumSize (0, 50), 
AutoEllipsis True,
Padding.Bottom = 16,
Appearance.TextOptions.Trimming EllipsisWord (or any trimming)
and set the text to several lines or a single line which wraps enough, the top lines disappear and the bottom line overflows into the padding (which should stay blank):
I would have expected to see:
Can this be fixed?

Hi there,
I am trying to create a "text box" that has custom syntax highlighting which makes the text between the "{}" blue and bold. The element in the {} are dragged from a tree list.
I have  tried the Rich Edit Control. I want to be able to bind the text to a variable in the viewmodel, but I have not figure out the way to do it.
Then I tried to use RichTextBox. I was able  bind the text and use an event handler for "TextChanged" to make the custom syntax highlighting, but there are some very curious things happening.
Here is my code for the event handler:
The first drop works fine. But if I do a second drop, all the text after the first "{" will be copies to the end of the line.
An example would be:
    Original text: 123
    Dropping "{Text1}" between 1 and 2: 1{Text1}23
    Dropping "{Text2}" between 2 and 3: 1{Text1}2{Text2}3{Text1}23
If I comment out the two "ApplyPropertyValue" lines at the end, the drag and drop works perfectly.
Could you give some suggestions on what is causing the problem mentioned above? 
I am trying to learn about RichEditControl, but I haven't got much luck searching online. Could you advise me on how to properly binding string variable in the viewmodel to the RichEditControl?
Thank you very much for the help.

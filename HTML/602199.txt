Hi,
I am trying to do spell check on fields with same IDs and different containers , when I do spell check on the second field, it actually does on the first one. 
The scenario is : 
1. I click on a field say 
in <div> 
and then I click on spell check button. It does spell check correctly
2. Now I click on a different field 
with same ID but different <div> container say 
.
3. But now the spell check is done again on the same field 
I tried  both CheckElement( element ) and CheckElementById( elementId ). (There is no way I could change the ID of the fields as they are used throughout the application in the same way.)
What are the other options available to fix this issue?

Hi,
       I have the following requirements:
       1. Show selected items with incremental filtering on
       2. Search with incremental filtering on but retain already selected items
       
       For the above requirements, the closest I found is to use 'TokenLookUpEditStyleSettings' but it falls short of the above. Can you please help to achieve the above? I saw one solution suggesting to use extended version of LookupEdit which I don't want to do nor modify the source code and compile.
Separate Requirements - Can create a separate ticket if needed..
1. How to change the Foreground of the Null Text? 
2. How to change the style of the tokens?
Thanks,
Manu

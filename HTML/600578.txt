Hi there,
I have a dxdatagrid connected to an OData V3 source.  Some columns have boolean sources.  The Possible values are:
* true
* false
* null
They can only filter for two values
* true
* false
Is it possible to filter for null values as well?
I have tried the following code but it is not working.  I loop through the columns of the grid. If the datatype is boolean, I extend the datasource of the lookup, and try to handle the undefined value
This solution works as far as filtering is concerned.  
Displaying the values, however, has changed.  I no longer see Checkboxes but the text from datasource (True,False, Emptystring for undefined).
How can I insure that a three state checkbox is displayed ?
Thank you for your help.

Hello!
I have the following BO's:
- Workgroup
- User
- WorkgroupMembership
WorkgroupMemebrship links User and Workgroup and defines Role of the user in Workgroup.Â WorkgroupMemebrship has the following properties: Workgroup, User and Role.
I need to implement the following scenario - certain users can have rights to delete WorkgroupMemeberships if Role = 'Member'. These users cant do anything to Workgroup or User and cant edit WorkgroupMemebrship, but must be able to delete it.
When i tried to implement this, i have stumbled on the issue - Delete action is not enabled due to security permissions. It appears that i need to let user to edit Workgroup and User properties to enable user to delete WorkgroupMemebrship object.
Is this by design? Is there any way to only let user delete object without granting him Write permissions?
Thank you!

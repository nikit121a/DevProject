We are having users complain about unintentionally affecting rows that they did not explicitly select in a grid with multiselect and grouping. When a collapsed group row is within a range that the user selects using shift-click to do a multi-select range, it selects the first row in the collapsed group. Usually the intent is selecting visible rows in expanded groups above and below it. But then the action affects one row within the collapsed, virtually never what was intended. One user would say "the group row is highlighted so why aren't all the rows in the group selected?" The other user says, "I didn't specifically select any row in the group, so why are any selected? And I certainly didn't mean just the first row in the group." This is very confusing to the users, and I agree that this is not intuitive behavior. 
When multiselect is enabled is there any way to disable selection of the group summary rows or otherwise deal with this issue?

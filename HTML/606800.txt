Hello,
I need to implement a devextreme multiselect dropdown box with simple list view bind,
I found the following link 
but both of the examples are tree view and grid view .
Can you provide me a solution to implementÂ devextreme multiselect dropdown box with list view.
I have also watched the dxtagbox but that is not what is required , I need list view with check box, like the attachment.
Please find the attachment.

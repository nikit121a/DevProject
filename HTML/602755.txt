I need to create a customer proposal master document which consists of multiple parts which can change with each project. Here are the main sources:
- RTF text with merge fields - this would be the covering letter
- Merge Snap document  - this could be product details
- Report v2 (showing header and 2 level of detail lines)
- Word documents (docx)
- PDF files  
- Image files 
What would be the best way to approach this?

Hello,
Im using ASPxGridview in a master detail scenario.
In each of the detail rows (template) im having a ASPxMenu.
When I click a specific button, a popup shows which needs to show some specifics to the current detailrow.
My question; How can I 'pass' the RowKey (GetDetailRowKeyValue??) to the code behind (or to the client for that matter) So I can identify which row Im working on...
thnks.
Br,
Richard

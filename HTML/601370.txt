Hi,
I know that it's possible to have an alternance for the style of detail data. Like the title says, I want to know if it's possible to have that same pattern but for my detail grouped.
Ex.:
1$-10$
White row
White row
White row
11$-20$
Grey row
Grey row
21$-30$
White row
White row
... 
Thank you,
David

NavigationFrame,Â BackNavigationMode is set to "
" 
)
I have 2 screens for the user to go to, and they have an "
" screen to navigate to . (the 2 screens have a grid, double-click goes to an edit screen).
But the 2 screens, I would like their "
" screens' PageAdornerControl, to only send them back one screen.

Hi,
We are looking for a way for dxPivotGrid to scroll horizontally (when needed) instead of increasing the size of its parent container  in our Angular project. We've tried the following:
- adding overflow: auto to the parent container
 - solution detailed inÂ 
- different settings for scrolling.useNative
Instead of adding a horizontal scroll bar to the pivot grid, we get a horizontal scroll bar on the browser window in our application. Is there a workaround to this?
Thanks
Mark

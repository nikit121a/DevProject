Hi,
I have a data source with data store configured  like this:
new DevExpress.data.DataSource(new DevExpress.data.CustomStore({
          loadMode: "raw",
          load: loadLookupFunction
        }))
The loadLookupFunction is calling remote server and return jQuery promise.  
This setup works with most widgets like dxSelectBox, dxTagBox,  dxDataGrid but i get an error when I use it with a lookup property in a dxDataGrid column. 
The error message is:
"TypeError: this._scheduleLoadCallbacks is not a function"
I made a plunker to show that: 
There are 2 widgets dxDataGrid with a lookup column which throws an error, and dxTagBox that works fine. Both use the same data source configuration.  
Could you please assist me in getting this to work? Is that kind of data store compatible with a lookup widget?

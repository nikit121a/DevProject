I am using skins, which automatically skin any TPanels on a form.
On one of my forms, I have a few TPanels which  should not be skinned because I need to control their colour.
So, I have  excluded seClient fromÂ MyPanel.StyleElements, hoping that might do what I want. It seems to work at design time (ie I can set their colour) but not at runtime (they still get the colour of the current skin and setting the colour in code has no effect).
Is it possible to do what I want?

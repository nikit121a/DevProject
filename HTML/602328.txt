We are using a WinForms environment and want to know if there is any technique that can be applied to dynamically load the details associated with a parent row in the grid when the + expansion button is clicked.   That is, using the primary key of the parent, only load the details with same key value in the foreign key of the details.
All the examples that I have seen so far have the data adapters fill the dataset/data table on form load however this technique, in our case, has resulted in slow grid load time due to the extremely large volume of data in the detail load - in our production database there are currently 3361 rows and in the details, there are currently 64015 rows.   So you can imagine how long it takes to load the data, especially the details, into the table adapter.
I have been given to understand that the "on demand" load of details is relatively easy in a WebForms application and was wondering if the same or very similar technique can be applied to a WinForms application.

Hi,
I am facing the problem that images (configured as UpdateMode=KeepSize and Sizing=ZoomImage) printed inside Snaplist and using SnapImage are incorrectly exported to PDF when  the SnapList is locked.
See attached project.
Click ExportToPdf ribbon item to invoke export to pdf.
There are two lines in the source code:
            LockSnapListAndItsFields(snapControl1.Document, true, true);
            //LockSnapListAndItsFields(snapControl1.Document, false, true);
If the first line is uncommented and the second line is commented (i.e. snaplist is locked) then the PDF is exported incorrectly (see \resources\EXAMPLE_wrong.pdf - proportions are lost, images are stretched)
If the second line is uncommented and the first line is commented (i.e. snaplist is unlocked) then the PDF is exported correctly (see \resources\EXAMPLE_correct.pdf  - exactly the sam as on snap report preview).
Why does it work this way? It looks like a bug , because locking of snaplist does not affect snap report view but it affects PDF.
How can we workaround this problem (fyi: we don't want to change the settings:  UpdateMode=KeepSize and Sizing=ZoomImage as they are crucial for our needs, if changing the setting is not the only possible option)?
Thank you.

Hello support team,
Once more I need your assistance. In WinExplorerView I have a grouping e.g. by name alphabetically. I would like to show the number of group items in the group header row, e.g. "A (10 items)". I think I know where to do it (in the CustomDrawGroupItem event) but I don't know how to get the number of items.In other support cases on this topic there is said to use "gridView.GroupSummary" but the WinExplorerView doesn't expose such a property. How can I achieve this?
Thank you!

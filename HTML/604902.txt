Dear,
I my application I use a pivot grid, based on a certain field in the data set i use a specific xtraEditor.
The application is initially build in devexpress version 16.2.6.0, for a change request we upgraded to devexpress version 17.2.4.0. 
Since the upgrade the editors in the pivor grid behave different.
In version 16 the editors mask was also used to display the cell value, even when not editing.
In version 17 we need to enter the cell to get the corresponding editor to display.
I have attached 4 screenshots, 2 from version 16 while displaying and while editing, and the same 2 for version 17.
In the change log I can't find any changes or breaking changes.
Can you advise on this topic?

Hi,
I am using updated version 17.2.5 in my project.
There is one issue which i am able to reproduce in given demos for localization.Â 
Please find below plunker link.
In Russian language while i am entering 0. it's taking '.' but it won't allow to enter it with any digit except zero
It could behave same in both the scenario.
Please let me know how could i resolve it?

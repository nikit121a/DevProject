So I have a list of buttons that I am trying to hide on my form.
I know to hide them I need to set the layoutcontrolItem for each Control to Visibility.Never.
I am also using a layoutcontrol which sets my buttons parent to the layoutcontrol which would then hide everything.
foreach (SimpleButton b in l)
            {
                if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(b.Text))
                    b.Visible = false;
            }
Anyway to access the layoutControlItem?

The linechart in my project will be updated every  10 seconds with a new value, that "problem" I solved already. But now I want the chart setup with the follwing, is that posible?
Is it posible to make the line chart always shows the last 15minutes? And for example scroll to show the earlier values/points
Is it posible to have always the same distance "on the chart" between two values/points? Now the distance is being reduced when a value/point is added to the chart. I also want to start the chart with the first point on the left.
An example of my project you can find here:

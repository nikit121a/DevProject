Hi,
I do not understand how the Math.Min/Max functions are supposed to be used.
They takes 2 numeric parameters .
I am giving it Max(myNumericVariable, 100) but I keep getting  "The expression cannot be evaluated".
It does not work with variables ?!
Please find attached screenshot. You can see the field I am using is numeric (by the icon with which it is listed at the left)

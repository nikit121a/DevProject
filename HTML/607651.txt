I have a layout.
Top area is menu and rest of the area used to display usecontrol.
Now I want to add multiple usercontrol when click on menuitem in 
 using 
.
So the UI Should be similar to 
and Each tab represents userControl.
How can I load Usercontrol in the tab usign Viewmodel
I was using Navigatoin Service to load Usercontrol in NavigationFrame. but Now I cant use in documentGroup.
I try to play with DevExpress Demo 
.
It is loading usercontrol when click 
 Button but it is in codeBehind.

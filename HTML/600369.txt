Hello support team,
once again I need your help, please. I am trying to create a simple WinExplorerView in ExtraLarge style from a list of objects. The object structure is as follows:
- string Name -> assigned to ColumnSet.TextColumn
- image Image -> assigned to ColumnSet.LargeImageColumn
- string ItemInfo -> assigned to ColumnSet.DescriptionColumn
- int Rating -> standard column, not visible
- ... lots of other columns, all not visible but intended to be used for grouping/sorting
Everything is well so far. Then I was trying to implement (custom) grouping and sorting for the view and after hours of trying I still didn't proceed. Perhaps you can help me on how to achieve the following programmatically:
- Group alphabetically descending by (first letter of) Name, group items sorted by Name descending
- Group descending by Rating, group items sorted by Name ascending
Or, in general, for other columns;
- Group alphabetically asc/desc by ColumnX, group item sorted by same column asc/desc
- Group asc/desc by ColumnX, group items sorted by ColumnY asc/desc
Also, is it possible to use a rating control for rating group caption instead of numbers?
I also could provide all sorting by the data source but I noticed that the view always does it's own sorting. I tried to avoid this by using the CustomColumnSort event but this also seems to influence grouping. All together this is more than confusing. I noticed that the WinExplorerView is far not as flexible as other view styles but perhaps some things can be done by code anyway. Can you give me a direction what I can do? 
Thank you!

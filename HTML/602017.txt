About another post that I wrote recently, I realize a project to reproduce the error, and of course, I can not include in this project phases too heavy. But suddenly I have to deal with a situation that has not happened yet.
Hence the title question of this post: How to make a file missing, used in a datasource, does not cause the stop of the document preview control being created?
an xtrareport.createdocument () statement encapsulates calls to subreports, and if only one of them is corrupted by an error, it prevents all the document from occurring.
Should i call in secret some subreport.reportsource.creadocument to catch error, and redirect subreport.reportsource to a sp?cial ErrorReport substitution ?

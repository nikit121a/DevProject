Hi DevExpress,
I noticed that RowTap event of your grid control is fired twice for single tap (at least on Android, haven't try it on iOS).
Attached please find my sample project.
As a workaround, I can filter the event based on timestamp. But since it's probably a bug, you should know...
Kind regards
Peter

Hi,
I have a form with a button "Open Modal",  when it is clicked a modal opens and it shows my datagrid.
The issue is that I want when I set the name of the input "Responsable" and the button is clicked the datagrid opens with the row of the responsable selected.
I use this function 
but it select only the first row and I didn't know the index of the row to select. 
How can I resolve this?

Hi,
I have a master detail grid defined (angular 4) as shown below.
However, when I click the expand icon (the > arrow), it expands the wrong row.
When stepping into it via browser debugger, it looks like the "e" event passed to onMasterRowPrepared(e) is just straight up not the correct row.
Do you know of why this is happening?

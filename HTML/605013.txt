Hi guys!
I've faced an issue that I cannot change an item in virtual mode of XtraTreeList .
Please see the attached project.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Run the solution
2. Click on the "Change item"  button.
Expected result:
"aaa 2"  should be displayed
Actual result:
"aaa"  remains
Please pay attention toÂ additional pieces of code in the simpleButton2_Click method: 
Some strange things happen if the first line remains uncommented.

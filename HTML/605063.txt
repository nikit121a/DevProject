I have an ASPxPopUp control which is a re-usable control for displaying multiple user controls... what I'm not certain is where I would place the ASPxHiddenField to make it available to the popup and the user controls... Currently it is located within a ContentTemplate...
I used an existing implementation of this style of Popup to build this one, but I wasn't using a hidden field in my prior example.  I was hoping that I could use one common hidden field as opposed to having multiple ones (one for each window), but as the program doesn't "know" about the hidden field I obviously have it in the wrong location... I would greatly appreciate it if someone could point out where I could place this hidden field.  I'm of the opinion that it needs to be within the CallbackPanel, just not certain where.

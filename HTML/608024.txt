Hello,
we have a grid with detailrows that contains also a gridview .
just like 
is it possible that when i change a column in 1 detailrow that all detailrows will take the position/width of the changed detailrow?
i save the  width and position in a cookie, so when i refresh the page it works but thats not what i want.

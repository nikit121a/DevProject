Hi, 
I would like to render a page on desktop browser and mobile devices  (see attachment). I therefore use the following code:
settings.SettingsAdaptivity.AdaptivityMode = GridViewAdaptivityMode.HideDataCellsWindowLimit;
settings.SettingsAdaptivity.AdaptiveDetailLayoutProperties.
= false;
settings.SettingsAdaptivity.HideDataCellsAtWindowInnerWidth = 500;
settings.SettingsPopup.HeaderFilter.SettingsAdaptivity.Mode = PopupControlAdaptivityMode.OnWindowInnerWidth;
settings.SettingsPopup.HeaderFilter.SettingsAdaptivity.SwitchAtWindowInnerWidth = 500;
settings.SettingsPopup.HeaderFilter.SettingsAdaptivity.MinHeight = 300;
As you can see on the attachment, I have the following Problems with the device Rendering (right side, green arrows):
a) the colon is drawn, although I set "ShowItemCaptionColon" to false -> do I set the wrong property?
b) my first column has no title, but is shown in the list of columns (on top) -> can I hide this empty box somehow?
c) I would like to increase the size of my 2 image buttons in the first column, but only for the device width-> how can I achieve this?
Thanks a lot for your help!
Best regards,
Johnny

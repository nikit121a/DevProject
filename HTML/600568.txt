The code before upgrading from 15.1.4 to 17.2.4 is as follows:




In our Gridview when we hover over the MB cell we get a custom table as tooltip with data. See attached picture "Tooltipworking.png".
The code after implementing the suggestion provided in the

Can you help us to find out what the cause is?
Thank you in advance.
Kind regards,

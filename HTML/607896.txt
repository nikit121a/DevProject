Hi,
Could you tell me what the equivalent is in WInforms of how I print in ASP .NET?
Basically I have the Report and I want to only display a PrintDialog to the user when they're ready to print, I don't need to display the PDF.
Thanks for your help, Jack
This is the code I use in ASP .NET Page_Load:
Dim r As New XtraReport()
r = CType(Session("MechReport"), XtraReport)
Using ms As New MemoryStream()
r.CreateDocument()
Dim opts As New PdfExportOptions() With {
.ShowPrintDialogOnOpen = False
}
r.ExportToPdf(ms, opts)
ms.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin)
Dim report() As Byte = ms.ToArray()
Page.Response.ContentType = "application/pdf"
Page.Response.Clear()
Page.Response.OutputStream.Write(report, 0, report.Length)
Page.Response.End()
End Using

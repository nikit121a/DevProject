Greetings,
Please find attached ScreenCasts to demonstrate the issue(s) I am facing and the 
 I've created for demonstration
Ref. 
I've tried to demonstrate that initially, when the (map) box loads, the map isn't displayed. After clicking a few times, the map controls show up and then further, when I click on the 
 button, the map shows up in the full screen view and after clicking 
keyboard button, the map now shows up in the box.
Ref. 
this issue is in continuation to the above, where the map isn't loaded up even after a location is entered until the full screen is toggled.
The Map is being displayed over a HTML popup. 
Also, in addition to the above, I would also like to check whether the map information (as displayed in google's search result) is available for us to access (ref. highlighted area in 
)
Regards,
Sachin Pise

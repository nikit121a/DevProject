Hello,
I am using a Web Control Chart to display my Pivot Grid data.
Data is # of images every 30 minutes graphed in a Line view type.
When displayed on the Web Chart Control, the x-axis is only shown hourly, which causes the half hour data point to not be spaced correctly.  
Need to display x-axis as a to a DateTime scale type with measuring units of minutes so the graph can be displayed correctly.
I have tried to set the set the diagram parameters programmatically, like so 
but when I debug the program I get an "
error. 
How do I get the my Web Chart to display the information from its PivotGrid Datasource correctly?
Example: at 9:00 there are 6 images and at 9:30 there are 3. Attached file shows you what the chart looks like

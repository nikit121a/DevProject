Hi,
I am using filter control in standalone mode. I need to make the column collections to be case insensitive.
I created one datacolumn collection in datatable with columnames and types
I bind the datacolumn collection (datatable) to filter control's source control.
When I make changes in filter field , then the operator dropdown becomes invalid.
e.g.
Filterfield : LOANMASTER|FIELD
DataColumn field : LoanMaster|Field , Type- String.
In above cases , I need the operator dropdown to be visible in all cases whether the field names are in upper/lower/camel cased.
Can you please help me in this
Thanks
Ajit

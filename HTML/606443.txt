Hello,
My TreeList uses FilterMode="Extended"
and
TreeDerivationMode="HierarchicalDataTemplate"
I want to show children nodes of the parent when the parent matches 
criteria. 
 I need to be able to search among children and display them 
 their parent. 
A
B
-->C
-->D
E
-->F
So when I search for B I'd like to see:
B
-->C
-->D
and when searching for C:
B
-->C
To achieve that I've inspired myself  from 
However this won't work since some nodes have IsFiltered set to false even if the do not match specified search criteria.
In the attached example from the 
 there is a weird
function that takes hardcoded "Name" parameter, and anyway the provided T490089 does not suits me as it also displays nodes that do not match search criteria.
Why Node.IsFiltered set to false even when node does not correspond to search criteria? How can this be fixed?
Thank you.

Hi,
I see the asp net viewer pdf demo.
When I change the page number I would like to extract its pdf text. I have create a function to extract text successful on my project. My function has one parameter (current page)Â 
My goal is to retrieve the current page, but I don't know how to modify the .ascx to obtain this. I need a new property Get_Page
Thanks in advance
William

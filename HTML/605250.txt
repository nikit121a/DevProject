I have a mvc dashboard with export enabled. 
When selecting Export to PDF and accept the default values and press OK. (attached picture name: Export PDF Option Window)
The export PDF doesn't include X-axis labels from bar chart.Â 
But if I set/configure some export option values, it displays X-axis labels.
Is there a way to configure these export option values as default values?

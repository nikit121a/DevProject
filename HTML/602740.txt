Hi
We have migrated our DevExpress version from 17.2.4 to 17.2.5
Before doing the migration we were able to create executable files; and those files were  distributed into our Client?s PC; and we were able to run the application there.
Now, after downloading the upgrade, the application (exe file created under 17.2.5) is not running anymore. The appication asks for the initial login screen, but after doing entering the user & password the application suddenly stops running and no further application screens are displayed. 
Please take in consideration that in a previous ticket, you suggested us: "
 " We did that when we had the 17.2.4 version and we solved the problem that time, but now with the 17.2.5 version we started having the same problem again.
We understand that the executable files created with the license can be re-distributable to other clients or machines without requiring additional licenses.  I?m attaching a file with some screens displaying the error, I hope it helps you to find the solution to our problem. 
We require your support to make us run that file in other machines. If we are still missing something please let us know. Many thanks in advance for your response.

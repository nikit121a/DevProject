Hello, since the update from 15.2.6 to 17.1.8 the TdxGPImage class seems to behave differently.
Creating a "screenshot" of a form and drawing it like this:
shows a different result because TdxGPImage.CreateFromHBitmap now checks if the image has a 32bit depth and at least one pixel has a value greater that 0 in the reserved part of the color information. (see TdxCustomSmartImage.CreateHandleFromBitmap)
It seems impossible the change this behavior, do you have any advice how to restore the old behavior and ignore the rgbReserved information?

Hello,
we're evaluating your Report Suite and are running into some problems. 
First off we're trying to convert our CrystalReports documents into your format. We tried the converters  we found in this post (
), but we didn't manage to get it running.
Our CrystalReports-Version is 13.0 .22 and XtraReports Suite Version is 15.2.16.
The second problem we are dealing with is, how we can  pass the DB connection-string to the Report Wizard? We are using a InterSystems Cach? Database and tried our "standard-connectionstring" but it didn't work. Can you please provide us a sample custom connection string?
Regards,
J?rg

I have a custom implementation of an IListServer that I use paired with grid controls to create a dynamically loaded list.  Since the upgrade to 17.2 (was on 14.2), I am finding that the Apply method is no longer called reliably when I change the sort order in the grid (in the past it worked all the time).  What is the correct way to capture the sort change events in the IListServer linked to a gridcontrol in 17.2?

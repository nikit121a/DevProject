Hi,
I'm working with XtraReports to generate a PDF report. Using XRLabels to display text or to bind object values. 
when the text in XRLabel is larger than the width we set  to the label, the text is splitting to next line as i set word-wrap property. But the next line is not moving down, due to which the text is overlapping on the below text.
I need to auto align the lines if the text comes to next line, but should not overlap. Could you please suggest me how can we solve this issue.
Thank You,
Adi.

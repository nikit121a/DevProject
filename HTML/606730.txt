Dear Support Team,
Currently i am using one DevExtreme MVC data-grid and chart in same page. Currently for both i am using same datasource.
But for both i have used separate action method. I have also one button for filtering and showing based on the selected text in dropdown.
When i click on button both should get refreshed. So when it refreshed calling again the defined action methods.
Can i use only one action method to load  both control?Â 
I have found some of the example in jquery.
But i need to do this for MVC.
Please suggest.
Thanks,
Veera

I am having an issue where items in a layout are not shown properly for the data type. Attached is a screen shot of my layout. All of the verify fields and sub-total fields are boolean data types. When I run the program they are shown as check boxes. When I do the layout, however, they are shown at character fields. Also, I have experienced issues where items not shown in the layout tree appear at the bottom of my form in a seemingly random position. Finally, The ability to add splitters, etc. has disappeared from the customization box. Only the empty item and any hidden fields from the model are shown in the list. There used to be a splitter and separator as options as well.

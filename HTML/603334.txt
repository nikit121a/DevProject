Hello All,
How can I set a JSON string value (converted from DataTable)  into a chart datadource
This is my code (behind) but it does not work. Chart does not show anything.
Dim JSONString As String = String.Empty
JSONString = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(dstData) 'Comment dstData is my DataTable
BootstrapPieChart1.DataSource = JSONString 'Comment: JSONString retrieves the data in JSON format fine.
BootstrapPieChart1.DataBind()
I have tried without the DataBind method but the result is the same. 
Also, I tried to set the DataSourceURL but the result is the same, nothing...

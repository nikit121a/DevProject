I am using a TreeListView bound to an EF datasource using a HierarchicalDataTemplate.  When I load the data I am doing an order by on a property called Sequence which is an integer.  Everything is displaying properly.  If I drag a node to change the sequence, the treeview works as expected, but I need to programmatically recalculate the sequence numbers and save to the database.  I have code to do this based on the order of the items in the collection.  I have a button that runs this code and it if I click it after dragging to change the order of the nodes it works.  But I can not seem to find an event of the TreeListView that fires after the collection is changed so that the user does not have to click the button.  I have tried CompleteRecordDragDrop but this is still too early, the order of items in the collection still has not changed.  Is there another event that fires later after the datasource had finished updating?
I have another related question.  If I drag a node to another parent, the item in the underlying datasource is moved to the proper parent collection.  But the EF navigation properties are not updated.  Should it be updating the navigation properties automatically, or do I need to do that myself in the same way I would need to update the sequence property above?
Thanks.

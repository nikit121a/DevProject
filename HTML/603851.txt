I have a Grid View and implementing batch editing.
One column is a bit/bool field called  "Acknowledge" displayed as a checkbox in the grid.
I want the user to be able to check it but not uncheck it.
 The logic is that the record can be "acknowledged/completed" but not "Unacknowledged/uncompleted".
How can I do this?

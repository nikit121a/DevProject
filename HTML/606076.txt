Hi,
when user enters value to cell which previously had other font, the font is lost and set to default. Another editing makes cell invisible.
Steps to reproduce.
1) put SpreadSheet on a form
2) run program
3) enter any text or number to a cell, i.e. Test, press ENTER
4) change font: use context menu on this cell, select  Format Cells, go to Font, Select Times New Roman, press OK
- now font has changed
5) in the same cell enter new value (don't edit previous): abcd, press ENTER
- font went back to previous one
Hint: once on the list is Times New Roman, second time it appears as Times New Roman CE.
If I use Consolas font face, problem does not appear.
Screen cast attached.

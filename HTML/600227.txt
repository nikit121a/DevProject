I have a XAF winforms application and the following scenario:
- there is a DetailView with several fields date, duration, description ...
- on this DetailView some action can be triggered automatically (after certain time - this is related to the application logic)
- triggered action access the DetailView.CurrentObject and updates the duration field
Now consider the following scenario:
- user is typing text into description field
- automatic action is triggered and updatesÂ DetailView.CurrentObject
- text typed by user into the description field disappears
I know why this happens - because the datasource (in this case DetailView.CurrentObject) is updated after the editor lost its focus. So while running the automatic triggered action it can see the previous value of description.
Is it somehow possible to "end edit" before the automatically triggered action is executed?

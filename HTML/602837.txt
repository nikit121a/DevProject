Hello,
I was testing a Web page with different Browsers that I had only used IE with before.
What I found was a difference in behavior with IE and Firefox vs Chrome and Edge.
I have a Popup that I share a lot of pages with. When the popup is closing I do 2 things.
In JavaScript, first I kill the Popup's Url and then I clean up some Session vars on the server.
InÂ IE and Firefox this goes to the server "only" for the callback. But in Chrome and Edge it goes
to the server twice. First for the popup's url or whatever, not as a postback or callback, and
then secondly to the server to kill the session vars.
I happened to see the problem because on the server-side a have a Page_PreRender Sub that
has call that Cleans out all variables, i.e. a clean slate. I have that in place trusting that it only ever 
gets hit the very 1st time the page renders but with Chrome and Edge that's not the case???
 
Is this a bug? 
Thanks, Jack
This is the javascript , again in IE and Firefox you only go to the server for the PerformCallback
but in Chrome and Edge you 1st go to the server for the Popup before going back for the PerformCallback. 
ShareThePop_JS.SetContentUrl( "" );
ShareThePop_JS.RefreshContentUrl();
ChartsCBPanel_JS.PerformCallback( "KillTheSessionVars:Mech" );

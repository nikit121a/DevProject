When Form.Shown is triggered, I call/set SchedulerControl.GoToDate() / SchedulerControl.Start to set the scheduler to a specific visible interval. This triggers the SchedulerControl.VisibleIntervalChanged event in which I call SchedulerControl.ActiveView.GetVisibleInterval() to retrieve the current visible interval and set data specific to this interval. However the visible interval is wrong, only returning the (shorter) visible interval as shown in the designer in VisualStudio.
Calling Application.DoEvents() before calling SchedulerControl.GoToDate() fixes the problem. When running the application with this fix you can see that the scheduler snaps to the correct size before calling VisibleIntervalChanged (which he did not do before the fix). It seems that there is a bug in the scheduler, where VisibleIntervalChanged is called before calculating the correct size of the scheduler.
After the form is shown and i call SchedulerControl.GoToDate by pressing a button (to switch to next/previous week) everything is fine, because the form/scheduler is already resized to the correct window size.
Im running the scheduler with SchedulerControl.OptionsBehaviour.UseAsyncMode = false, so there should not be any problems because of async operations.

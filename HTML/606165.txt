Hi,
I have tested ASPxTreeView against UltraWebTree (Infragistics) by using similar methods.
It has been found that the first method works much slower than second.
Can you please have a look and advise whether there is a way to improve the performance of ASPxTreeView? 
Here is the method that uses ASPxTreeView.

Hello,
We are encountering a mismatch behaviour in spreadsheet control.
We have a read only table with a defined data range (like C10:D20). 
Using right click on header row,
If we try to insert rowÂ  at 15th row, we correctly have a warning.
But if we delete the 15th row, the row is deleted without any protection!
Is it an issue you have fixed in next version? 
If not, what is the best way to not allow user to delete row containing read-only table data range?
Thx in advance

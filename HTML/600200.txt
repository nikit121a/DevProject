Hello,
I have an aspxlistbox with encodehtml false to display fontawesome icons for each items . That works well. I enable the new search feature. The search is working fine. But all the html highlight is deleted. Even if I cancel the search, all the items which were mathcing the search remains without HTML.
Do you have an idea how to fix this?
Thanks
Michael

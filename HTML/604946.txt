Could you please suggest the way to handle which ToggleSwitch selected from list of them
Here is list of "ImportModules" and only 
can be selected. Problem is I'm not able to detect which one is selected (with Mode=TwoWay)
I have VM:
and XAML
 Only one selection works, but "OnIsSelectedChanged" not raises os IsSelected doesn't has any value or Event doesn't raises

Hello!
I want to restore some saved filter expressions.
It's impossible to restore FilterRowMenu condition. The first condition is always selected. But data are correctly filtered.
 Only for some conditions, the filter value is not restored in the filter column. If you click on the "Filter 1" button, the filter condition contains "Not Contains([ProductName], '2')". The filter value (2) is not restored, but data are correctly filtered.
See the attached zip which contains the sample project and a video.
Thanks for your help!
Best regards!
Alex

Hi,
we are having a grid with 50+ columns with form edit mode. There is additional logic in editingStart event and customizeItem method. All these together cause a delay of 4s in IE11 for the grid to open the edit form since the click of edit.
I have made loading panel visible in editingStart event, I can see that the command is executed as soon as edit is clicked but the load panel is appearing only after the same lag  duration.
Please suggest how get the loading panel as soon as edit is clicked or any other kind of intimation to the end user that t he grid edit form will be displayed shortly.
Thanks.

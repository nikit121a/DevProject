Hi,
This is Nagaiah here.
 
We are using TcxGrid with TcxGridBandedTableView.
Requirement:
We had a problem with the text selection in the grid , when we want to edit the cell value of the grid (f2 key press )then total cell gets selected .
But we had a requirement from the user that whole cell value  should not be selected and cursor should be  place at the last position of the text
Please find TestApp.Zip it contains 
1. C++ project 
2.Cursor should be at last position of the text.png
Thanks and Best Regards,
Nagaiah Polamala

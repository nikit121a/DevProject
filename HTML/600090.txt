Hello,
I'm using dxPivotGrid and i'd like to know if it's possible to add a slider to resize the columns of Pivot Grid.Â 
I've attached an image to show that, when the Pivot is in a small page it's almost impossible to see the columns because the rows don't resize. I'm using many rows levels in my Pivot so when i try to resize it  or i open it with a small resolution it's really to see the columns values.

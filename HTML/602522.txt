Hello,
I Using WPF MVVM Pattern.
I Have one Gridview in that bound Employee List.
I want when I double click on any Row  of Employee List Grid that time Navigate on another view.
That view include detail information about that employee.
Your Devexpress Demo have that type of example but that code I don't understand
This example in Touch Enable Hybrid App. in Employee Tab.I want that type of functionality.
In my code when I run my application and double click on Grid row I getting that error
on GetServiceÂ <INavigationService>
An exception of type 'DevExpress.Mvvm.POCO.ViewModelSourceException' occurred in DevExpress.Mvvm.v17.2.dll but was not handled in user code
Here is my code.
Employee Main View
Employee Main View Model

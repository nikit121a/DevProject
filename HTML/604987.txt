Hello,
I was just wondering how you would collapse/shrink a table cell that has multiple columns.
For example - Attached Image 1
I would want to shrink the null lines to prevent having gaps on the report. So it would instead appear like this (attached image 2).
Is this possible without separating both columns into separate tables  in order to use CanShrink and Process Null Values - Suppress and Shrink.
Thanks,
Tom

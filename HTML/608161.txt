I have a model class:
This is set to the model in my page and my form looks like (from intellisense)
But the field is coming through as blank.
If I change the items to items.AddSimple().DataField("modelId")  then it loads the data but doesn't send it back up with the form submission.
Is this intended behaviour?Â  Am I going about this  wrong?
Incidentally the standard asp net @Html.TextBoxFor(m => m.ModelID)  works.

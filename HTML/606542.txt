One day I will be found dead at my desk and the cause will be excessive head bashing into wall while dealing with these ComboBoxEdit controls... 
I have window with a simple comboboxedit using a simple datasource from my SQL database. 
 The comboboxedit works great. I can see all the values just fine. The problem is... I load this page from a grid - mouse doubleclick. I want to pull the data from the GRID into the window so the user can see the values and decide whether to edit the values or not. 
Inside GetTherapyEditor
The reader returns the text value EXACTLY like the comboboxedit shows in the drop down. How do I get the text returned from SQL to show in the 
ComboBoxEdit list - like in the attachment.

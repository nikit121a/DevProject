Hello there,
I?ve got the following problem.
I have a database with an hierarchical table: TableH (ID, ParentID, Name).
I have a second Table, where Items from TableH are preselected: TableP (ID)
I want to display the Treelist from root to leaf, but only if any key in this path isÂ present in TableP.
The problem is that the Items in TableP can be from anywhere from root to 3rd Level but i want to display the tree from the beginning, even if the Item in TableP is in 2nd or 3rd Level.
I have created a Storedprocedure for a non-virtual Treelist and this is working fine but the loading times are relatively long and im curious if it is possible to do this in virtual mode.
Kind Regards

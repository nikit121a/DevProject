Hi,
I think my problem statement is clear from the subject. I read few suggestions to solve this problem. Use autowidth and set MinWidth for each column,
But in my case, i am binding grid to datatable. I am not using gridcolumn and defining column names. Instead I am using autoGenerateColumn=AddNEW.
How can I achieve this considering in mind all these parameters.
Thank you

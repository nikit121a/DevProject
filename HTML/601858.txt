I have been trying to figure out the method that will work like the example in  Ticket T278629  
I have included a project that I am using to get the correct behavior.  I modeled it after the example here.
 In this example the RepositoryItemMemoExEdit has a method "AllowClosePopup" that can be overridden.  In RepositoryItemPopupGalleryEdit this method doesn't exist.

I have the following scenario:
In an order entry form, the save button cannot be pressed until the entire form is valid.
When an invalid value is entered into an editor, 
.
Most fields need to be validated by a call to our web API.
I attached a small example to show what I have set up now. 
MainWindow.xaml:
MainViewModel.cs:
This does more or less what I want to achieve, but there is a problem with this approach:
The validation for the 3 fields is already triggered when the window is loaded. In our order entry form, that would mean dozens of API calls to validate all fields in the form.
Is there any way to prevent this?

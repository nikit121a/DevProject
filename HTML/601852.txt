Hello.
My scripts are broken everywhere because some changes that were made on your dx.all.d.ts file.
These are the problems:
======================
- dxPivot, dxDataGrid, dxLookupOptions breakings
dataSource members are breaking my KnockoutObservable<any> assignments.
So  I noticed the interface now forces:
==>>    string | Array<any> | DevExpress.data.DataSource | DevExpress.data.DataSourceOptions
It should be <any> because you dont know what datasource one would use AND consume.
Also, getting the array from the observable datasource is impossible (I.E.  var array = grid.dataSource()   <-- throws error)
======================
- DevExpress.ui.dxPopupToolbarItemOptions is missing
It is definitely removed? Have something in the functionality (the js code) somewhat removed also?
if the js code is intact can you summon that interface back?
I have changed your dx.all.d.ts so I can have the project back, but it will break everything again after every upgrade.
Can you help me addressing these issues?

Hello There,
We are using MVC gridview in our project. One of the column/field have alphanumeric values .. most of the time they will be in a pattern like  abc12 or abc-12 etc ..Â 
The issue is that  the order I am getting is like below:
abc1       
abc10       
abc100
abc1000
abc1001
abc1002
abc101
abc1010
abc2 
but I require like this: abc1
abc2 
abc10
abc100
abc101 
abc1000
abc1001
abc1002
abc1010
Hope my query is clear .. please share suggestions

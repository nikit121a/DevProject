Hello,
I am trying to upload to a subfolder in Amazon AWS via the InsertImageDialog in the HTmlEditor.
Currently I can browse, view, and select from the main folder, and all sub-folders in my Amazon bucket.
For the image upload section, however, I can only get the uploaded file to go into the bucket, not a specific subfolder. 
How can I target a specific subfolder in the bucket?

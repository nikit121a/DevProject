Hi,
I am usingÂ DevExtreme().FileUploader() control and in that i want user to select only PDF files and "prevent" from selecting other files. I specified accept attribute as Accept(".pdf") but it is still showing "All Files". Can you please tell me how i can hide that? Please refer attached screenshot.

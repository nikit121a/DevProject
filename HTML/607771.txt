I have attached a sample project showing the functionality missing.
When you run the app, you will see 2 ComboBoxEdit controls:
The first has  ApplyItemTemplateToSelectedItem set to False.
The second has ApplyItemTemplateToSelectedItem set to True.
On IsMouseOver both ComboBoxEdits change their respective border's color.
On IsKeyboardFocusWithin only the first ComboBoxEdit's border changes color, while the second does not.
I wanted to know if you had any idea why this was happening? and if there was a way to fix it so the second ComboBoxEdit's border will pick up the IsKeyboardFocusWithin event?

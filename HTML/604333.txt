Hello,
I have a gridview with a column that displays links to a social media site. I would like the user to be able to click the link that is displayed in the column, and open the social media site in a new tab. How can I accomplish this? I was looking at some examples, and tried to piece the functionality together with this: 
var linkedInCol = settings.Columns.Add("LinkedIn", "LinkedIn", MVCxGridViewColumnType.HyperLink);
    linkedInCol.Visible = false;
    HyperLinkProperties properties = linkedInCol.PropertiesEdit as HyperLinkProperties;
    String urlFormatString = "{0}";
    properties.NavigateUrlFormatString = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(urlFormatString);
    properties.TextField = linkedInCol.Caption;
 but the link was treated as a redirect to an action, rather than an external website.
Thanks,
Sean

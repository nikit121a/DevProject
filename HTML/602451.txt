Hello,
I try to implement the client side dashboard into a Angular cli project. I follow the steps described 
 . Instead of adding the scripts in the head section of the side, I added them in .angular-cli.json:
When starting my application I get the following error in dx.dashboard-control.third-party.min.js:
define(...) is not a function
Can you help me please?
S?ren

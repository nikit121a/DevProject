Hi,
The following behavior looks like a bug.
We have an application using the DocumentView/TabbedView where each Document is a UserControl that has a Ribbon.  
- When a document is activated (TabbedView.DocumentActivated), the ribbon of the UserControl is merged into the Ribbon of the Main form 
- When a document is deactivated (TabbedView.DocumentDeactivated), the ribbon of the Main form is unmerged.  
Here is what we do to produce a problem:
- Open a UserControl (UC1) with a Ribbon whose items have no shortcuts
- Open another UserControl (UC2) with a Ribbon that has an item with a shortcut (CTRL+F5 for example)
- Switch back to the tab of the first UserControl
--> Now.. the ribbon of UC1 is visibly merged into the main Ribbon.
--> However, when I press the Shortcut Key (CTRL+F5 in our example), the Ribbon item on UC2 reacts (even though it is currently not merged)
Maybe it's reacting because the ribbon of UC2 is still technically there (inside UC2) but not visible.  In that case, we would need a way to temporarily disable shortcuts on a given ribbon object.
What should we do here?
Best,
acl

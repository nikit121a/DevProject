Hello,
For some reason, when I change SettingsBehavior/MergeGroupsMode to Always, I'm getting "Error Rendering Control" "An unhandled exception has occurred infos.Length(0) < 2"
If you turn MergeGroupsMode back to Disabled, the control renders properly.
 I'm attaching a simple project and screenshot.

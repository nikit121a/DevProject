Hi DevExpress team,
currently I'm converting some flash based chart controls to your webchart control and need to keep the layout as close to the original as possible. Thus how do I show a Side-by-Side Stacked Bar and a Side-By-Side Bar in one webchart (see screenshot)? 
For example, in this code:
"s/w Systeme" needs to be a side by side bar and next to it,Â  "Farbsysteme s/w" and "Farbsysteme Farbe" needs to be 
Side by Side 
 bar.
Thanks for your help & kind regards,
Patrick

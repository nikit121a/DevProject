Hello DevExpress!
I use the bootstrap webapplication template from build 17.2.5 to create a new website with authentication model Identity.. The site created from the template works as expected. But if I update to the latest  Bootstrap/jQuery 4.00/3.3.1 from NuGet then the menu works fine until the browser window is so small  that the menu is collapsed to a button. When pressing the button nothing happens. Other buttons are not working either.
Try my test site 
 Buttons are not working. Reduce the browser window until the menu is collapsed and then press the menu button...
Any suggestions? 
Ole

Hello Support,
Group summary and summary footer are visible . Summary footer gives following options through menu
Summary options
None
All Nodes
at group summary level, I am getting only Summary options and None. How can I get same informat ion here. 
Is it possible to have same functionalities as grid is having for summary. If not then fine, but group summary menu should have same options as summary footer.
Thanks
Sandip Kumar

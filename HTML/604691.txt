The dxDataGrid function getSelectedRowKeys() will not return the accurate keys if a row has been selected and re-selected a few times. 
To duplicate this bug:
Create a dxDataGrid : 
Note this function is also used to generate a property of obj called selectedRowKeys when using the onSelectionChanged, like in this example.
Select multiple rows, then select and deselect the same row a few times.
The console logs will show that the row keys in the selectedRowKeys array is being overridden.
The keys do not correspond with the actual keys, which can be seen in obj.selectedRowData.realKey.

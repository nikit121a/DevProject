I am trying to build a new project using the scaffolding wizard to create a tabbed MDI interface but the wizard is not detecting my entity framework context that is a referenced project.  I am attaching my solution.  I have taken the following steps.
1. Created a data project with EF code first.
2. Created a blank WPF project.
3. Added a reference for the data project to the WPF project.
4. Added a connection string to the app.config file for the WPF project that points to the database the EF project is configured for.
5. Clean and Rebuild Solution.
6. Right-click on the WPF project and select Add DevExpress Item - New Item.  Under the WPF Scaffolding Section, select Tabbed MDI View
7. Click the Run Wizard button.
In the Data Bound Tabbed MDI View, the list of existing DbContext is empty.  What am I missing?
Thanks,
Scott

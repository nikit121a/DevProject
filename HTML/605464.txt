I am upgrading our software from using v13.2 to v17.1.6 and have encountered the problem of combining two reports using XtraReport.Pages.AddRange(); see the attached code snippet. The first report is in portrait mode and the second report to combine is in landscape mode. This worked fine in v13.2, but after upgrading to v17.1.6, only the first report is display in the print preview and printed to the printer. The second report is fine when preview / printed by itself. I have even tried to using the code example of the merging of the two reports in your documentation, but still only the first report is preview / print.
Thanks for your assistance.

Hello,
I'm looking for a solution to provide a design time editor for SvgImage objects (in my own custom controls) for the property grid of Visual Studio.
The editor provided by DevExpress is doing it very fine, so of course I do not want to reinvent the wheel.
So, the question is: Can I use the SvgImage Editor for my own controls?Â 
Convenient would be a possibility to write code like this:
Currently this code won't work, because DevExress.Utils.Design.SvgImageEditor doesn't exists. 
UPDATE:
Everything is fine and works as expected. My Issue was caused by a missing reference.

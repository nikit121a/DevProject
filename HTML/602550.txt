Hi support team!
The first component selected has the AutoPostBack = False property, the second AutoPostBack = True.
When I select the "Montadora", reload my screen completely.
How to make the screen does not recharge completely.
I used to use UpdatePanel, but I do not know how to do it in DevExpress. Do you have an example, please?
See the video attachment as an example.

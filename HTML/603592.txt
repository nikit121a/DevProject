Hi, I'm trying to create a small Chart control showing 2 series of 2 points each. The available space is limited to 200x128px.
Here's the XAML
The labels on X axis are not visible, or only Ecc is visible. Is it possible to fix the data to show on axis? And is it a way to change the font-size of the labels on axis?
Due to the small space, is it possible to reduce the width of each Bar? And the space between two different x-points?
Finally, how can I modify the color of the Bars of each serie? The automatic color method is fine but I need to use red for the first serie anc blue for the second one.
Thanks. regards.

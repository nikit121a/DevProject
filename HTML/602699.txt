I was wondering if there is a way to change the image being display in an ASPxButton control?
I need to display an image indicating how many items were selected... I know I can do this via a asp:multiview control and have 6 buttons queued up to change the display as the number of items change... not the preferred  method...
when I put in the command "ASPxButton.Image =" I get a message from the compiler that this is a read-only field during runtime ...
Is it possible via java?
or am I up the proverbial creek?

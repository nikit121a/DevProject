Hi again,
I have a problem trying to bind an observable collection to a chart.
I took one of your examples, the E2595, I've modified the code according toÂ  my needs but I'm not able to reach my goal.
I have three problems, the first one I want to change the graph type, from pie to bar chart,
the second one I don't understand why if I move the filling of data from constructor to the populate button method the program doesn't show anything.
And the thirdh one when I click on add point, nothing happens.
Could you please help me?
Thank you

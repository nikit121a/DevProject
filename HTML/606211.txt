Hi,
when I try to change font face to Wingdings 2 using code below it works. But when I load any xlsx file (freshly created in Excel 2007) and try to do the same for any cell, it is not changed. For some other fonts it worked ok.
Cell stores new font name but is not rendered correctly. It seems that this font is not seen after loading file.

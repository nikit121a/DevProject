Hi !
I've a trouble with some additional header after export to Excel. If I do it using DeatilArea or DetailHeaderArea, this will merge my Columns bellow this Area. Is it possible to add some text above pivotgrid, without merge?Â 
What I really need:
Export to Excel;
Add 2 rows above
Write text  in this additional rows;
Save Excel:
Best regards,
Konrad

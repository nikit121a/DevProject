Hello,
I am using AutoFilterByColumn to set filter to a gridview column. However there is no reverse method to reverse the filtering to previous state, aka removing the Auto Filter from a specific Column.
I can use grid.AutoFilterByColumn("Field",null) but i suggest adding a new clientside method to make it easier.
Take it as a suggestion.
Thanks
Onur

Good evening, 
I am devlepoing my application using XAF. In my web application I have a custom view where I use the ASPxTreeList control in order to display some data. One of my needs is to be able to show the Filter buttons (
) but if I set the ShowHeaderFilterButton to True, when I run the aplpication and navigate to my vie there is still no filter button. What could be the problem?
Bellow is the code from my ascx to better contextualize my issue:
Thanks,
Pablo.

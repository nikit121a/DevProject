Hi. I've upgraded some project from Dx 17.1 to 17.2.5 and after upgrade some of my custom code does not work any more. I'm using xtradiagram with customized DiagramShape. I have also custom DiagramShapeView becouse I do some custom draw inside it.
After upgrade to 17.2 my custom shapes are not visible on diagram control.
I've minimized my custom code to represent problem in attachment.  When form is loaded i create two shapes:
- one simple DiagramShape which is visible
- one custom Diagram shape which is not visible
Custom diagram shape has very little custom code so I hope that you can help me quick.Â

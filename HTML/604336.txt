Thanks for your support.
I was trying to get the collection's list view so that I can append filter to the data collection source of the list view.
But everytime  I am trying to get list view from the deatil view , I am getting null value.
Am I doing anything wrong.?
Here is the code snippet.
ListPropertyEditor listedfor=((DetailView )View).FindItem("TaskListCollection") as ListPropertyEditor;

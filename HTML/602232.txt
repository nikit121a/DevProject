We have a custom dialog form with a TcxMemo on it to control the display of a message. The form populates the memo box with the message and then sets the Properties.VisibleLineCount according to how many lines of the memo contains and then adjusts the form height accordingly. 
We are currently on v15.1.3 of the VCL controls but moving towards upgrading to v17.2.4 where this problem arises. 
I have attached a compressed file that contains 2 small sample applications to demonstrate this issue in both version of the components. The TcxMemo-DevEx15.1.3 folder contains a project that compiles with v15.1.3 and shows how the form works as we expect and the TcxMemo-DevEx17.2.4 folder contains a project that compiles with v17.2.4 and shows how the form no longer adjusts it's height because of this issue.

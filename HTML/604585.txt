Hi.
I'm trying to make sure when I display a Print Preview of an Xtra Report via the ShowRibbonPreviewDialog() method that it is ALWAYS maximized on the user's screen.Â  I'm using code similar to the following - but it does not work (uses the last screen size set by the user)
printTool = new ReportPrintTool(report);
printTool.PreviewRibbonForm.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized;
printTool.ShowRibbonPreviewDialog(UserLookAndFeel.Default);
can you help me to get this working???
Thanks!

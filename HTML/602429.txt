Hello!
I have aÂ SingleChoiceAction with several ChoiceActionItems. I need to open popup window with ListView to let user choose one or many records based on ChoiceActionItem selected by user.
Im using the following code to open popup window:
As you see, im checking if user select correct records according to the prior selection of ChoiceActionItem.
The problem is - if im setting E.Cancel to true, XAF opens detail view of the selected record. I dont need that, i need to simply do nothing if user clicks on record that does not fit certain criteria.
How i can prevent opening of new popup window when user clicks on record in popup window and DialogController.Accepting event is cancelled?
Thank you!

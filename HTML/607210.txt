Dear Support Team,
Recently we started a new MVC project intended for internal use.
Because we started to use DevExtreme in our 'Onview' webapplication, we desided to make full use of Devextreme in this internal webproject.
So we started this project as an DevExtreme MVC5 application.
Now the basics are in, and we started to implement reports.
We used: 
 
And when we run this, we get Error E0024. (Occurs if a DevExtreme bundle is linked more than once on a single page).
Also, when we place the next code in _Layout.cshtml we also get this error:
So when we use DevExpress in combo with DevExtreme, we always get this error???
Maybe we must just start over with a regular MVC project, and add DevExpress Scripts.
Then we can also use the DevExtreme widgets, because that's how we do it now in our commercial application.
What route should we take?
Best Regards,
John van de Pol

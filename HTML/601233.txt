Hello,
How do I remove space between TabControl border and content (picture)? I don't want any distance between tab content and control borders.
I believe it should be padding in 
 dxt:DefaultStyleThemeKey FullName=DevExpress.Xpf.Core.DXTabItem 
I've also tried to change values in
x:Key="{dxt:DefaultStyleThemeKey FullName=DevExpress.Xpf.Core.DXTabControl}"
(TabItem.xaml and TabContent.xaml), but it doesn't help.
I am using it in MVVM pattern and it is bound to VM's.
/ Best regards
Dmitri

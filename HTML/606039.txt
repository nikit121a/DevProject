I have the following requirement in my grid...
1. when the user TABs thru the cells in the row and reaches the last cell, tabbing once more must add a new row in the grid.
2. TABBING must continue in the new row and cycle should repeat
3. when user presses ESC, focus must come out of current cell and the context row must be selected.
4. Pressing TAB again must move focus out of grid to the next control.
Any idea of how to accomplish this?

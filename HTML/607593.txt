Hi,
What I wanted to achieve is SimpleButton which look a little bit different, so I've come up with this code:
I have several problems with this code:
1.) The BIButton doesn't show up in Toolbox, despite setting [ToolboxItem(true)]
2.) In runtime button looks as expected except AppearanceDisabled.BorderColor value is ignored. It seems that Appearance.BackColor is used instead.
I tried as well achieve this by creating skin, but couldn't set independent BackColor/ForeColor for activated/deactivated states.

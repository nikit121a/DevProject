Hello, I'm drawing 2 linear level bars one near the other, they show a balancing value divided for left and right.
Here's the XAML code:
How can I change the color of bars? Setting a different color for each bar?
How can I modify the width of the bar ad make it wider?
Now I've put the 2 bars one near the other, but both of them has the numeric scale visible. How can I hide one of them and maintain only one scale for both bars?
Thanks, best regards.

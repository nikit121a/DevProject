hi, I'm trying to globalise the 'Green Mist' theme, from 
,  into my MVC application but I cannot. I know there are quite a few articles about this issue, but I cannot figure out how to do it.
I copied the css into the contents folder
I gave a reference into the web.config
Can you please provide a step by step procedure on how to do it?

Hello,
I've a Persistent Object of type 'A' that contains a nested XPCollection of type 'B'. But 'B' can be created (on a different View) separately from 'A' without any dependence. 
The problem starts when I create this 'B' object that It's validating parent object and I don't need this validation. This column will be NULL on this case.
I've created relation like this:
 Is there any way not to validate Object 'A' from Object 'B'? 
Thank you.
